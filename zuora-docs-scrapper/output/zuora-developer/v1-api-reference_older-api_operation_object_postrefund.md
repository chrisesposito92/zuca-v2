## CRUD: Create a refund

Creates a refund.

If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, you can use this operation to unapply the payment from an invoice or multiple invoices, and refund the payment.

If the unapplied payment is left in the following scenarios, you have to reapply the unapplied payment to the original invoices:

-   An electronic refund in Processing status is handled to change to Error. An unapplied payment is left.
-   An electronic refund gets to Error, and payment reapplying fails due to the concurrent issue.
-   The refund canceling operation updates the status of a refund from Processed to Canceled. When it is successful, an unapplied payment is left.

##### header Parameters

| Idempotency-Key | string <= 255 charactersSpecify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident. |
| --- | --- |
| Accept-Encoding | stringInclude the Accept-Encoding: gzip header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a Content-Encoding header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. |
| Content-Encoding | stringInclude the Content-Encoding: gzip header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. |

| Zuora-Entity-Ids | stringAn entity ID.

If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. |
| Zuora-Track-Id | string <= 64 charactersA custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), and quote ('). |
