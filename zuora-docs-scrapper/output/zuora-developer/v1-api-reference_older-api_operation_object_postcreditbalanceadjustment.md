| --- | --- |
| Accept-Encoding | stringInclude the Accept-Encoding: gzip header to compress responses as a gzipped file.

| Zuora-Track-Id | string <= 64 charactersA custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers.
