Request

##### path Parameters

| account_idrequired | stringIdentifier for the account, either account_number or account_id |
| --- | --- |

##### header Parameters

| zuora-track-id | stringA custom identifier for tracking API requests. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), or quote ('). |
| --- | --- |
| async | booleanDefault: falseMaking asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150 milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and the response body contains only a request ID. |
| zuora-entity-ids | stringAn entity ID. If you have Multi-entity enabled and the authorization token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation on. If the authorization token is only valid for a single entity or you do not have Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. |
| idempotency-key | stringSpecify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types. This idempotency key should be a unique value, and the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request using this value. For more information, see Idempotent Requests. |
| accept-encoding | stringInclude a accept-encoding: gzip header to compress responses, which can reduce the bandwidth required for a response. If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes. For more information about this header, see Request and Response Compression. |
| content-encoding | stringInclude a content-encoding: gzip header to compress a request. Upload a gzipped file for the payload if you specify this header. For more information, see Request and Response Compression. |

##### Request Body schema: application/json
required

| post | booleanIf true, invoices will be automatically posted. |

| renew | booleanIf true, subscriptions will be automatically renewed. |
| charges_excluded | Array of stringsCharge type or types to be excluded. Can be one or multiple of the following values:one_timerecurringusage |
| credit_memo_reason_code | stringA code identifying the reason for the credit memo transaction that is generated by the request. The value must be an existing reason code. If you do not pass the field or pass the field with empty value, Zuora uses the default reason code. |
| document_date | string <date>The date when the credit memo is applied |
| subscription_ids | Array of stringsThe IDs of the subscriptions that you want to create the billing documents for. Each value must be the unique identifier of the latest version of an active subscription. |
| target_date | string <date>All unbilled items on or before this date are included. |
