# Payment Method Snapshots

A Payment Method Snapshot is a copy of the particular Payment Method used in a transaction. If the Payment Method is deleted, the Snapshot continues to retain the data used in each of the past transactions. As such, the Snapshot helps with display of historical transactions, integrations to external systems, and reporting.
