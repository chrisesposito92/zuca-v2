# Entities

An entity represents a business unit that operates independently and can sell products to multiple countries. Each entity has its own Zuora environment in which the entity users can perform business operations independent of the other entities. In a multi-entity hierarchy, an entity can share certain business objects with the other entities. Users that are created in an entity can be granted access to the other entities with different roles and permissions.

**Note**: Entities are available only if you have the [Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Tenant_Management/Multi-entity) feature enabled. If you want to have access to the Multi-entity feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](“http://support.zuora.com/”).
