# Custom Object Records

With Custom Objects service, you can create, update, delete and find custom object records.

If you use Postman, you can import the custom objects endpoints as a collection into your Postman app and try out different requests to learn how the API works.

You can sign up for a free account on the [Postman website](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup) and download the app in case you do not use Postman yet.

Note that the Custom Object Records API is versioned by `Zuora-Version` in the request header. The response may be different for the same request with a different API version. Specify `Zuora-Version` in the request header if you expect a specific response schema.

### Error handling

If the Custom Objects API call fails, an error code will be returned in the response body. See [Custom Objects API error code](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zuora-platform/extensibility/custom-objects/custom-objects-api/custom-objects-api-error-code) for details.
