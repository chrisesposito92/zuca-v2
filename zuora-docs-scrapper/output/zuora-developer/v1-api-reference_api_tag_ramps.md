# Ramps

A Ramp is a time container to associate with rate plan charges in your subscription. Inside the Ramp, you can further define a set of Ramp Intervals (time-based periods) where products or pricing can change. These periods are sub time containers to enable you to report out-of-the-box metrics based on Ramp Intervals.

**Notes**: You must have both the Ramps feature and Orders feature enabled for your tenant to use the Ramps operations.

For more information, see [Ramps and Ramp Metrics](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Ramps_and_Ramp_Metrics).
