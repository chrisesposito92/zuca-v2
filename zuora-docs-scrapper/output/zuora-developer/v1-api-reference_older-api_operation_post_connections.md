## Establish a connection to Zuora REST API

Establishes a connection to the Zuora REST API service based on a valid user credentials.

\*\*Note:\*\*This is a legacy REST API. Zuora recommends you to use [OAuth](https://developer.zuora.com/rest-api/general-concepts/authentication/) for authentication instead.

This call authenticates the user and returns an API session cookie that's used to authorize subsequent calls to the REST API. The credentials must belong to a user account that has permission to access the API service.

As noted elsewhere, it's strongly recommended that an account used for Zuora API activity is never used to log into the Zuora UI. Once an account is used to log into the UI, it may be subject to periodic forced password changes, which may eventually lead to authentication failures when using the API.

Request

##### header Parameters

| Idempotency-Key | string <= 255 charactersSpecify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident. |
| --- | --- |
| Accept-Encoding | stringInclude the Accept-Encoding: gzip header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a Content-Encoding header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. |
| Content-Encoding | stringInclude the Content-Encoding: gzip header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. |
| Authorization | stringThe value is in the Bearer {token} format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling Create an OAuth token. |
| Zuora-Track-Id | string <= 64 charactersA custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), and quote ('). |
| Zuora-Entity-Ids | stringAn entity ID. If you have Zuora Multi-entity enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. |
| apiAccessKeyIdrequired | stringAccount username |
| apiSecretAccessKeyrequired | stringAccount password |
| Content-Typerequired | stringMust be set to "application/json" |
