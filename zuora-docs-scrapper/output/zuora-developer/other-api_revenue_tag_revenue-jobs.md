# Revenue Jobs

The Revenue Jobs operations are used to submit the following programs with Revenue APIs:

-   RevPro3.0 Data Collection Master
-   RevPro3.0 Event Process
-   RevPro3.0 Event Process Master
-   Revpro3.0 Accounting Transfer Master
-   RevPro3.0 Transfer Batch for Org

No matter what program is to be started, two path parameters are required for the [Submit a program with specified parameters](https://developer.zuora.com/other-api/revenue/operation/POST_SubmitRevenueJob/) operation. One is the program ID and the other is the organization ID. Operations are also provided to retrieve the program ID and organization ID.

For an example of using API to submit the Revpro3.0 Accounting Transfer Master program, see [Us API to submit a predefined program](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Revenue/Best_practice_for_using_Revenue_APIs#Use_API_to_submit_a_predefined_program) in the Knowledge Center.
