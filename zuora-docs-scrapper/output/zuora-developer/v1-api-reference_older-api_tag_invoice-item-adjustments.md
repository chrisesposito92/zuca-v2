# Invoice Item Adjustments

Invoice item adjustments allow you to adjust the invoice details, including taxes at the charge level, and have those adjustments reported in the system under the same accounting code as the items that are being adjusted.

**Note**: The [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) feature is a replacement for Invoice Item Adjustments. We recommend that you enable Invoice Settlement to take advantage of the improved functionalities. If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, the Invoice Item Adjustments feature is deprecated and invoice item adjustments are not presented in the UI. If you have to export data for invoice item adjustments, use [Data Source](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Reporting/D_Data_Sources_and_Exports/D_Generate_a_Data_Source_Export), [Data Query](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/Query/Data_Query), or REST API.
