# Features

After you have created a feature, you can add features to the products and subscriptions to enhance your product offerings.

To create features in the product catalog and use them in subscriptions and Zuora Quotes, you need to enable the following:

-   The Entitlements setting in your tenant. Access to the Entitlements feature requires a specific edition of Zuora. For more information, see [Zuora Editions](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/C_Zuora_Editions).
-   The [Enable Feature Specification in Product and Subscriptions](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Billing_Settings/Define_Default_Subscription_and_Order_Settings#Enable_Feature_Specification_in_Products_and_Subscriptions.3F) setting in the Billing Settings.
