## CRUD: Create an export

Use this operation to create a data source export. After you have created a data source export, use [CRUD: Retrieve an export](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/older-api/operation/Object_GETExport/) to check the status of the data source export and access the exported data.

### Limits

Zuora system enforces the following limits on data source exports:

-   The maximum processing time per export is 3 hours. If an export is executed for longer than 3 hours, it will be killed automatically.
-   The maximum number of concurrent exports is 50 per tenant. Exports in `Pending` and `Processing` status are counted towards the concurrent export limit. Zuora system will reject the subsequent data source export requests once the concurrent export limit is reached.

When you export data from Zuora, each exported file is available for download for 7 days. Data source exports (Export objects) older than 90 days are automatically deleted.

**Note:** This operation supports the [Export ZOQL](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL) query language. However, this operation does not support some data sources, objects, and fields in Export ZOQL queries. For full compatibility with Export ZOQL, Zuora recommends that you use the [AQuA API](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/T_Aggregate_Query_API) instead of this operation.

##### header Parameters

| Idempotency-Key | string <= 255 charactersSpecify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident. |
| --- | --- |
| Accept-Encoding | stringInclude the Accept-Encoding: gzip header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a Content-Encoding header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. |
| Content-Encoding | stringInclude the Content-Encoding: gzip header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. |
| Authorization | stringThe value is in the Bearer {token} format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling Create an OAuth token. |
| Zuora-Entity-Ids | stringAn entity ID. If you have Zuora Multi-entity enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. |
| Zuora-Track-Id | string <= 64 charactersA custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), and quote ('). |
| X-Zuora-WSDL-Version | stringSet the value to 80 if you want to export data about Debit Taxation Item and Credit Taxation Item. |
