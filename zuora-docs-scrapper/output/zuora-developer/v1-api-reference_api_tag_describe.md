# Describe

You can use the [Describe an object](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/operation/GET_Describe/) operation to get a reference listing of each object that is available in your Zuora tenant.

By default, the information returned by the "Describe an object" operation corresponds to the latest version of the Zuora WSDL.
