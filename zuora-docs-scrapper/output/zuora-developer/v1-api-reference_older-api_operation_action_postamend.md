## Amend

Modifies a subscription by creating Amendment objects. However, to modify a subscription, Zuora recommends that you use the [Create an order](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_Order/) operation instead of this action.

The Amend action cannot modify the custom fields on the Subscription object. You can use the [Create an order](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_Order/) operation to modify the custom fields on the Subscription object. You can use this action to create up to 10 Amendment objects.

You must specify the following fields for each Amendment object:

-   `ContractEffectiveDate`
-   `Name`
-   `SubscriptionId`
-   `Type`

Additionally, the value of `SubscriptionId` must be the same for each Amendment object. You cannot use this operation to update multiple subscriptions. When you call this operation, Zuora modifies the subscription in the order that you specify Amendment objects in the request body. If Zuora is unable to create an Amendment object when you call this operation, the entire call fails.

**Amendment Preview** To view taxation item data for invoices and credit memos in the amendment preview response, you need to set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` request header to `120` or later.

Request

##### query Parameters

| rejectUnknownFields | booleanDefault: falseSpecifies whether the call fails if the request body contains unknown fields. With rejectUnknownFields set to true, Zuora returns a 400 response if the request body contains unknown fields. The body of the 400 response is:{     "message": "Error - unrecognised fields" } By default, Zuora ignores unknown fields in the request body. |

##### header Parameters

| Idempotency-Key | string <= 255 charactersSpecify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident. |
| --- | --- |
| Accept-Encoding | stringInclude the Accept-Encoding: gzip header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a Content-Encoding header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. |
| Content-Encoding | stringInclude the Content-Encoding: gzip header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. |
| Authorization | stringThe value is in the Bearer {token} format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling Create an OAuth token. |
| Zuora-Entity-Ids | stringAn entity ID. If you have Zuora Multi-entity enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. |
| Zuora-Track-Id | string <= 64 charactersA custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), and quote ('). |
| X-Zuora-WSDL-Version | stringDefault: 79Zuora WSDL version number. |

##### Request Body schema: application/json
