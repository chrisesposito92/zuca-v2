# Settings

The Setting API provides a central API for managing settings in your Zuora tenant.

If you use Postman, you can import the Settings API endpoints as a collection into your Postman app and try out different requests to learn how the API works. You can sign up for a free account on the [Postman website](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup) and download the app in case you do not use Postman yet.
