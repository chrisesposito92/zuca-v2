## Execute

Use the execute call to execute a process to split an invoice into multiple invoices. The original invoice must be in draft status. The resulting invoices are called split invoices.

To access this feature, see [Enable Splitting Invoices](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/IA_Invoices/Splitting_Invoices#Enable_Splitting_Invoices) for steps.

To split a draft invoice into multiple split invoices:

1.  Use the create call to create a single InvoiceSplit object to collect all of the InvoiceSplitItem objects.
2.  Use the create call to create a separate InvoiceSplitItem object for each split invoice that you want to create from the original draft invoice.
3.  Use the execute call to split the draft invoice into multiple split invoices.

You need to create InvoiceSplitItem objects and an InvoiceSplit object before you can use the execute call.

-   Supported objects: InvoiceSplit
-   Asynchronous process: yes

Request

##### query Parameters

| rejectUnknownFields | booleanDefault: falseSpecifies whether the call fails if the request body contains unknown fields. With rejectUnknownFields set to true, Zuora returns a 400 response if the request body contains unknown fields. The body of the 400 response is:{     "message": "Error - unrecognised fields" } By default, Zuora ignores unknown fields in the request body. |

##### header Parameters

| Idempotency-Key | string <= 255 charactersSpecify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident. |
| --- | --- |
| Accept-Encoding | stringInclude the Accept-Encoding: gzip header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a Content-Encoding header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. |
| Content-Encoding | stringInclude the Content-Encoding: gzip header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. |
| Authorization | stringThe value is in the Bearer {token} format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling Create an OAuth token. |
| Zuora-Entity-Ids | stringAn entity ID. If you have Zuora Multi-entity enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. |
| Zuora-Track-Id | string <= 64 charactersA custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), and quote ('). |
| X-Zuora-WSDL-Version | stringDefault: 79Zuora WSDL version number. |
