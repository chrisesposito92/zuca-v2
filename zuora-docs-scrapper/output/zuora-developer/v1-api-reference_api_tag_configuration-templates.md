# Configuration Templates

Configuration Templates in Zuora Deployment Manager enable you to configure your tenants in minutes by importing a templated metadata configuration file. This feature eliminates the need for long manual configuration processes that would have previously taken hours. You will be able to access a comprehensive repository of industry-specific templates. It will be easier for you to deploy and release. To use this API for migrating metadata from a source tenant to a destination tenant, you should authenticate using credentials of the source tenant The user will have to provide the client id and secret key from the sou.rce tenant.
