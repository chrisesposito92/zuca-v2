# Prepaid with Drawdown

The Prepaid with Drawdown feature is a pricing model for consumption-based services, such as data storage. Under this model, customers pay upfront to receive a number of units, usually for a period of time like a month or a year. Then they consume against that prepayment balance in a use-it-or-lose-it fashion, with a possibility of topping up more units or being charged for any overage. This model strikes a balance between upfront commitment and the pure pay-as-you-go pricing models.
