# Custom Object Definitions

With Custom Objects service, you can define custom objects, extending the Zuora data model to accommodate your specific use cases.

If you use Postman, you can import the custom objects endpoints as a collection into your Postman app and try out different requests to learn how the API works.

You can sign up for a free account on the [Postman website](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup) and download the app in case you do not use Postman yet.

Note that the Custom Object Definitions API is versioned by `Zuora-Version` in the request header. The response may be different for the same request with a different API version. Specify `Zuora-Version` in the request header if you expect a specific response schema.

### Error handling

If the Custom Objects API call fails, an error code will be returned in the response body. See See [Custom Objects API error code](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zuora-platform/extensibility/custom-objects/custom-objects-api/custom-objects-api-error-code) for details.
