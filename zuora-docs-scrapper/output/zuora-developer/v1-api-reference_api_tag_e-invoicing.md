# E-Invoicing

With the [E-Invoicing](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/leverage-advanced-capabilities/e-invoicing/e-invoicing-overview) feature, Zuora supports electronic invoices through an integration with partners that have a local presence, where required, which guarantees compliance with local invoice regulations.

All the operations in this section are available only if you have the E-Invoicing feature enabled.
