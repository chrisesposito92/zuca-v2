API object names for Describe

You can use the [Describe](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/tag/Describe/) operation to list the fields of each Zuora object that is available in your tenant. When you call the operation, you must specify the API name of the Zuora object.

**Note**: We recommend that you use the [Object Queries](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/tag/Object-Queries/) or [Data Queries](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/tag/Data-Queries/) to query objects.

The following table provides the API name of each Zuora object:

| Object | API Name |

| Accounting Period | AccountingPeriod |
| Amendment | Amendment |
