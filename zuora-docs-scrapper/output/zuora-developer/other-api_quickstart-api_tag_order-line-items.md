# Order Line Items

Order line items are non subscription based items created by an order, representing transactional charges such as one-time fees, physical goods, or professional service charges that are not sold as subscription services.
With the Order Line Items feature enabled, you have the ability to launch non-subscription and unified monetization business models in Zuora, in addition to subscription business models.
