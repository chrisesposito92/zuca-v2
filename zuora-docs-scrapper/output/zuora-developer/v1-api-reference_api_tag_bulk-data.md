The Bulk Data API operations allow you to manage bulk data loader services and perform programmatic CRUD (Create, Update, Read/export, Delete) operations.
To perform data ingestion with a CSV file in Zuora Billing using the Data Loader Bulk Data APIs, see [Tutorial for Bulk job API with CSV](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Platform/Data_Management/Data_Loader/Tutorial_for_Bulk_job_API_with_CSV).
