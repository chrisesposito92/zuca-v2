# Debit Memos

Debit memos increase the amount a customer owes. Debit memos can be used to correct undercharging on an invoice or to levy ad hoc charges outside the context of a subscription. Just like an invoice, debit memo balances can be settled by applying either a payment or a credit memo. For more information about debit memos, see [Credit and debit memos](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/B_Credit_and_Debit_Memos).
