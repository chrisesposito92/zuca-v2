# Fulfillments

Fulfillments are subordinate objects attached to their related order line item. You can manage the entire order line item lifecycle through fulfillments in the following ways:

-   Create and attach fulfillments to an order line item to track the shipment or return status.
-   Trigger billing based on the fulfillment state and generate billing documents based on the fulfillments accordingly.
-   Create and attach fulfillment items to a fulfillment to keep track of all the assets in your system.
