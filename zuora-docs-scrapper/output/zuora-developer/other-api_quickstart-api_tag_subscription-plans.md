# Subscription Plans

A subscription plan is part of a subscription or an amendment to a subscription, and it comes from a price. Like a product and its plans, a subscription can have one or more subscription plans. Subscription plans represent a price or a collection of prices for a service you sell. An individual subscription plan contains all prices specific to a particular subscription.
