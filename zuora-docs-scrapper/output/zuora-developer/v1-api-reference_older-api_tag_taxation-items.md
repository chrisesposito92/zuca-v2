# Taxation Items

The TaxationItem object is used to add a tax amount to an invoice item. In the typical use case, the tax amount that you specify in the object is calculated by [Z-Tax](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Taxes/A_Zuora_Tax) or a third-party tax engine such as [Avalara](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Taxes/Direct_Avalara_Integration) or [Connect tax engine](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Taxes/Additional_resources_on_taxes/AA_Connect_Tax_Engines).

Changes that you make with this object affect the product charges in your product catalog, but not the charges in existing subscriptions.
