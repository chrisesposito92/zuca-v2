## Multi-entity: Share a product with an entity

Shares a product with a target entity. Zuora synchronizes the shared products to the target entity after sharing. For more information about product sharing, see [Products Sharing Across Entities](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/C_Business_Objects_Sharing_Across_Entities/B_Products_Sharing_Across_Entities).

Note that:

-   You must finish all the [prerequisites](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/C_Business_Objects_Sharing_Across_Entities/B_Products_Sharing_Across_Entities/Share_Products) before sharing products with other entities.

-   Only source entity administrators have permission to share products with other entities. You must make the call as a source entity administrator.

-   Currently, you can only share a product with one entity at a time. An error occurs if you try to share a product to more than one entity.


Request

##### path Parameters

| product-idrequired | stringThe unique ID of the product you want to share. For example, 8a808255575bdae4015774e9602e16fe. |
| --- | --- |

##### header Parameters

| Idempotency-Key | string <= 255 charactersSpecify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident. |
| --- | --- |
| Accept-Encoding | stringInclude the Accept-Encoding: gzip header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a Content-Encoding header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. |
| Content-Encoding | stringInclude the Content-Encoding: gzip header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. |
| Authorization | stringThe value is in the Bearer {token} format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling Create an OAuth token. |
| Zuora-Track-Id | string <= 64 charactersA custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), and quote ('). |
| Zuora-Entity-Ids | stringAn entity ID. If you have Zuora Multi-entity enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. |
