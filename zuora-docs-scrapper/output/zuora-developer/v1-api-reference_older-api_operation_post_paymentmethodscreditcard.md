## Create a credit card payment method

**Note: This legacy API operation is no longer under active development. For more features, it is strongly recommended to use the [Create a payment method](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_PaymentMethods) operation.**

You can create a credit card payment method for a customer account or an orphan credit card payment method that is not associated with any customer account.

This API call is CORS Enabled. Use client-side JavaScript to invoke the call.

If you use this operation to create credit card payment methods instead of using the [iFrame of Hosted Payment Pages](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/LA_Hosted_Payment_Pages/C_Hosted_Payment_Pages/B_Implementing_Hosted_Payment_Pages_on_Your_Website/C_Embed_and_Submit_the_iFrame), you are subject to PCI-compliance audit requirements.

Request

##### header Parameters

| Idempotency-Key | string <= 255 charactersSpecify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident. |
| --- | --- |
| Accept-Encoding | stringInclude the Accept-Encoding: gzip header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a Content-Encoding header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. |
| Content-Encoding | stringInclude the Content-Encoding: gzip header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. |
| Authorization | stringThe value is in the Bearer {token} format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling Create an OAuth token. |
| Zuora-Track-Id | string <= 64 charactersA custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), and quote ('). |
| Zuora-Entity-Ids | stringAn entity ID. If you have Zuora Multi-entity enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. |
