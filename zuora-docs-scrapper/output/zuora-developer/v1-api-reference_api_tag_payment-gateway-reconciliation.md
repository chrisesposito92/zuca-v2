# Payment Gateway Reconciliation

Gateway reconciliation is the process of verifying that the electronic payment and refund transactions processed in Zuora match the transactions reported by the gateway. For example, if Zuora processed 200 transactions through a gateway, you should see the same number of transactions on the gateway's reconciliation report, sometimes also called the settlement report.

You can complete the following Gateway Reconciliation tasks through API:

-   [Settle a payment](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_SettlePayment/)
-   [Reject a payment](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_RejectPayment/)
-   [Reverse a payment](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_ReversePayment/)
-   [Reconcile a refund](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/POST_ReconcileRefund/)
