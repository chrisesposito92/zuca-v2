# Debit Memos

Debit memos increase the amount a customer owes. It is a separate document from the invoice. Debit memos can be used to correct undercharging on an invoice or to levy ad hoc charges outside the context of a subscription. Just like an invoice, debit memo balances can be settled by applying either a payment or a credit memo.
