## Transfer report ownership

Transfers ownership of one or more reports to a different user.

You can transfer ownership using either `reportNames` or `reportIds`.

**Authorization requirement:**
The user who obtains the OAuth token must have the **Zuora Reporting Administrator** role.

To get the `userId` of the new owner, navigate to:
**Administration Settings** > **Manage Users** > Click the new owner name > In the URL, locate the `id` value:
`https://{zuora_endpoint}/apps/UserLogin.do?method=view&id=<userId>&...`

That `id` is the `newOwnerUserId`.

For detailed usage examples including `curl` commands, see the [Transfer Report Ownership](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Platform/Data/Reporting/E_Reporting_API_Reference/Transfer_Report_Ownership) Zuora Knowledge Center article.

Request

##### header Parameters

| Idempotency-Key | string <= 255 charactersSpecify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.With this header specified, the Zuora server can identify subsequent retries of the same request using this value, which prevents the same operation from being performed multiple times by accident. |
| --- | --- |
| Accept-Encoding | stringInclude the Accept-Encoding: gzip header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a Content-Encoding header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. |
| Content-Encoding | stringInclude the Content-Encoding: gzip header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. |
| Authorizationrequired | stringThe value is in the Bearer {token} format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling Create an OAuth token. |
| Zuora-Track-Id | string <= 64 charactersA custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), and quote ('). |
