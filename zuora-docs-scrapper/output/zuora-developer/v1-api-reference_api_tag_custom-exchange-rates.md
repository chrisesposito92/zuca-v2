# Custom Exchange Rates

If you use a custom exchange rate provider and upload rates with the Import Foreign Exchange Rates mass action, you can query custom foreign exchange rates from Zuora through API.

This feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/).
