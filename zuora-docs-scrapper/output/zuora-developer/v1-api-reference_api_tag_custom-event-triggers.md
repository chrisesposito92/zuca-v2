# Custom Event Triggers

The Event Trigger service manages the business events and trigger conditions that are defined on [Zuora Business Object Model](http://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Business_Objects_Relationship) or custom objects. When a Zuora object changes, the trigger conditions defined on the object are evaluated, and if any condition qualifies, a business event will be triggered and turned into a notification.

**Note**: Event Triggers operations are only applicable to custom events.
