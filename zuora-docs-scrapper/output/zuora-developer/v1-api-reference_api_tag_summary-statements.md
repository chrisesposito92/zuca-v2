# Summary Statements

The Summary Statement feature provides a comprehensive overview of billing activities for each account using HTML templates that compile data like invoices, credit memos, payments, and more. The associated APIs help automate the creation and management of these statements. See [Account Summary Statements](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Zuora_Billing_Reporting/Account_Summary_Statement) for more information.
