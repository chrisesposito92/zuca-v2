# Charge Revenue Summaries

The Charge Revenue Summary represents a summary of revenue amounts from all revenue schedules on the whole subscription charge. For example, revenue for one-time setup charges, recurring charges, and overages.

You can [list all details of a charge revenue summary](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/older-api/operation/GET_CRSByCRSNumber/) or [retrieve a charge revenue summary by charge ID](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/older-api/operation/GET_CRSByChargeID/) through the REST API.
