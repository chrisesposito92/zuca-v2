# Billing Preview Run

A billing preview run asynchronously generates a downloadable CSV file containing a preview of future invoice item data and credit memo item data for a batch of customer accounts.

**Note**: Credit memo item data is only available if you have the [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) feature enabled.
