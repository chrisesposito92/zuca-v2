# Meters

The Zuora Mediation APIs provide a comprehensive set of endpoints to manage, test, run, and monitor usage meters. These APIs support actions such as running or testing specific meter versions, importing and exporting meter configurations, managing input files, performing event store operations, and ingesting usage data in real time via streaming. All APIs follow a consistent response structure to simplify integration and error handling. Use these APIs to automate and streamline your usage processing pipeline—from data ingestion to transformation and billing.
