# Catalog

**Note** - The APIs in this section are legacy APIs. Zuora recommends using the newer, faster APIs for managing products and catalogs more efficiently instead. For more information, see our latest [Commerce API](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/tag/Commerce/).

The Zuora Billing product catalog is where you define your products and pricing. The product catalog's ability to handle sophisticated pricing models gives you the power to easily adapt your pricing to customer and market needs, to grow your business and drive more revenue.
