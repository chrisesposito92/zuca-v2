# Payment Runs

Payment runs are used to collect payments using electronic payment methods. Even if a payment was made to an invoice but had an error, if an invoice has a positive balance and meets all the filter criteria for the payment run, Zuora will pick up the invoice for processing in the payment run.
Zuora supports two type of payment runs: ad hoc and recurring. These are similar to ad hoc and scheduled bill runs
