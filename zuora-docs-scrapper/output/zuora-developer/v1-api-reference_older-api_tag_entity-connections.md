# Entity Connections

If you want to share business objects across entities, you have to set up a connection between the source entity and the target entity first.

**Note**: Entity connections are available only if you have the [Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Tenant_Management/Multi-entity) feature enabled. If you want to have access to the Multi-entity feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](“http://support.zuora.com/”).
