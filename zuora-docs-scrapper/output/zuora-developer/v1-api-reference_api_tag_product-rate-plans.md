# Product Rate Plans

**Note** - The APIs in this section are legacy APIs. Zuora recommends using the newer, faster APIs for managing products and catalogs more efficiently instead. For more information, see our latest [Commerce API](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/tag/Commerce/).

A product rate plan is the part of a product that your customers subscribe to. Each product can have multiple product rate plans, and each product rate plan can have multiple product rate plan charges, which are fees for products and their product rate plans.
