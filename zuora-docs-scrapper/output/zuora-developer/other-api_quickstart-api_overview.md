# Quickstart API Reference (2025-11-12)

Download OpenAPI specification:[Download](https://developer.zuora.com/yaml/swaggerv2API.yaml)

Zuora's Quickstart API represents a simplified programmatic experience with coverage for common eCommerce use cases only. Quickstart is NOT a replacement of the [v1 API](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/overview/).

**If you are starting new development, we recommend you use the v1 API for all your use cases.** New features are only available in the v1 API. We no longer recommend Quickstart for new eCommerce development. We are not deprecating the Quickstart API and will continue to fix bugs, but we will not accept enhancement requests for the Quickstart API.

To use the Quickstart API, you must have the following features enabled on your tenant:

-   [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Manage_accounts%2C_subscriptions%2C_and_non-subscription_transactions/Manage_subscription_transactions/Orders) or [Orders Harmonization](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Manage_accounts%2C_subscriptions%2C_and_non-subscription_transactions/Manage_subscription_transactions/Orders_Harmonization)

-   [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
