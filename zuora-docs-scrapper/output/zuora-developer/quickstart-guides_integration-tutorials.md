Integration tutorials

The integration tutorials in this section facilitates your ERP integration and CRM integration with Zuora.

Three integration patterns are available for integrating with your ERP. You can choose to integrate multiple ERP and CRM patterns depending upon your needs.

The three ERP integration patterns are:

-   [GL Summary integration](/quickstart-guides/integrate-erp-with-zuora-billing-summarygl/) : Most common pattern. Zuora's Billing and Revenue products both support a close process that automatically generate GL entries for transfer and insertion.
-   [ERP item level integration](/quickstart-guides/integrate-erp-with-zuora-billing-item-level/) : You choose to centralize all your AR in your ERP even though Zuora's AR and collections abilities are superior to your ERP's capabilities.
-   [ERP Fulfillment integration](/quickstart-guides/integrate-erp-with-zuora-billing-erpfulfillment/) - Zuora Billing manages AR with this pattern. Your ERP manages the inventory, warehousing, and shipment of physical goods. Zuora bills for both digital (including subscription) items and physical goods.

The ERP item level pattern and the ERP fulfillment pattern are complementary. You will implement one or the other, but not both.

Integrating your CRM with Zuora Billing empowers your CRM users to view customer billing data extracted from Zuora Billing. See [CRM integration quickstart guide](/quickstart-guides/crm-integration-quickstart-guide/) for details.
