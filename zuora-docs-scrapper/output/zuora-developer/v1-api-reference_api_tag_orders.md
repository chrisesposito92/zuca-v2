# Orders

Orders are contractual agreements between merchants and customers.

You can create multiple subscriptions and subscription amendments at once in a single order. All the operations on subscriptions in orders are done by order actions. You can also create order line items to support your non-subscription based business models.

Zuora calculates order delta metrics when orders take place. You can retrieve order delta metrics and measure billed and unbilled amounts by order.
