# Product Rate Plan Charge Tiers

**Note** - The APIs in this section are legacy APIs. Zuora recommends using the newer, faster APIs for managing products and catalogs more efficiently instead. For more information, see our latest [Commerce API](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/tag/Commerce/).

To manage product rate plan charge tiers, use the [Product Rate Plan Charges](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/tag/Product-Rate-Plan-Charges) operations instead to update the corresponding product rate plan charge with all the tiers.
