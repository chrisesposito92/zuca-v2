# Exports

You can export items from Zuora to CSV or HTML files, such as large data sets, invoices, payments, and so on. Use the Export object and Export ZOQL queries to create an export file that you can download and use for charting, reporting, accounting, or for other business intelligence uses.

When you export data from Zuora, each exported file is available for download for 7 days. Export objects older than 90 days are automatically deleted.
