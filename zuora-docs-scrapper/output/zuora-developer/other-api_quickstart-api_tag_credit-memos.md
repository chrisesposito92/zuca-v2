# Credit Memos

Credit memos reduce invoice and account balances. By applying one or more credit memos to invoices with positive balances, you can reduce the invoice balances in the same way as applying a payment to an invoice. For more information about credit memos, see [Credit and debit memos](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/B_Credit_and_Debit_Memos).
