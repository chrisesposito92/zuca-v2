# Omnichannel Subscriptions

An omnichannel subscription is a subscription originating from external and source systems, such as the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Roku Store.

To create, update, delete, or retrieve an omnichannel subscription, you must turn on the Omni-Channel Subscription feature. For more information, see [Omni-Channel Subscription](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zuora-billing/manage-accounts-subscriptions-and-non-subscriptions/manage-subscription-transactions/common-subscription-information/omni-channel-subscription).
