# Sequence Sets

You can create billing document sequence sets through the REST API or the Zuora UI, allowing distinct numbering sequences for billing documents, payments, and refunds.

To create a billing document sequence set through the Zuora UI, see [Create Billing Document Sequence Sets](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Billing_Settings/Prefix_and_Numbering_Configuration_for_Billing_Documents/Create_Billing_Document_Sequence_Sets) for more information.
