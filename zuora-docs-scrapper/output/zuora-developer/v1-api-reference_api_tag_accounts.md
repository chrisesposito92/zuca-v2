# Accounts

Some operations in this section are similar to each other, but are provided for different use scenarios. You should choose the one that best suits your needs.

For example, the [Retrieve an account](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/operation/GET_Account/) operation retrieves the basic information of an account, such as bill-to and sold-to contacts, billing and payments setup information, and metrics data for the account.

The [Retrieve an account summary](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/operation/GET_AccountSummary/) operation returns the more detailed information of an account, such as bill-to and sold-to contacts, subscriptions, invoices, payments, and usages associated with this account.
