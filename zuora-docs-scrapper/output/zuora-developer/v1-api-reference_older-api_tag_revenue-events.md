# Revenue Events

A revenue event is a record or audit trail about a change to a revenue schedule. When you manually distribute revenue schedule, if no change is made to the revenue schedule, no revenue events will not be created.

A revenue event is comprised of:

-   **Date**: The date when the event occurred.
-   **Revenue Event Type**: The action or activity triggering the revenue event.
-   **Recognition Start** and **Recognition End**: The start and end dates for the revenue recognition period.
-   **Revenue Item**: The distribution of revenue (or adjustments) into accounting periods.
