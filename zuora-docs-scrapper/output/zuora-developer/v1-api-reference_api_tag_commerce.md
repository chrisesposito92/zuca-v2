# Commerce

The Commerce APIs provide access to product catalog, plans, charges, and order management functionality in Zuora. These endpoints are used to create, update, and query product rate plans, charges, and dynamic pricing details that drive subscription and billing behavior.

In a typical use case, the Commerce APIs are called to provision new products or plans in the catalog, configure dimensional pricing, or submit orders that create and modify subscriptions.

Changes made with these APIs affect the product catalog and active subscriptions, depending on the endpoint. Catalog changes update future subscription behavior, while order operations directly impact customer subscriptions in real time.'
