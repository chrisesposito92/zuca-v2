## Search reports by name

Retrieves all reports that match a query based on the report name, description, or data source name.

Reports are not required to have unique names or descriptions and so this search will typically return many report matches because of matches from multiple fields unless you specify a unique query keyword. Optionally you can specify sorting on either the `name` or the `updated_on` fields. The search is automatically limited to the first 50 results. If you want to query for the next 50, you have to set the `searchStart` parameter to 50 and submit another request to get the next 50 results.

Request

| queryrequired | stringThe query parameter value sets the search string used to search through all report names, data source names, and descriptions. The value {string} can be any alpha-numeric string like: MyReport1.Search is not case-sensitive.Spaces in the query parameter must be replaced by %20.Words smaller than three letters are excluded from matching.Search results include matches from any position in the word. For example, if the search term is "count", the search results will include words such as "counted," "account," and "accounts." |
| --- | --- |
| orderBy | stringSorts the results by name or updated_on value. The value of the orderBy statement request path parameter must match the following syntax exactly: [{"field": "updated_on", "ascend": "true"}] Where the value of field can be either "name" or "updated_on" and the value of ascend is either "true" or "false." |

##### header Parameters

| Accept-Encoding | stringInclude the Accept-Encoding: gzip header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a Content-Encoding header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Encoding | stringInclude the Content-Encoding: gzip header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. |
| Authorizationrequired | stringThe value is in the Bearer {token} format where {token} is a valid OAuth token generated by calling Create an OAuth token. |
| Zuora-Entity-Ids | stringAn entity ID. If you have Zuora Multi-entity enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header. |
| Zuora-Track-Id | string <= 64 charactersA custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), and quote ('). |
