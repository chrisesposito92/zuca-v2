# Product Rate Plan Charges

**Note** - The APIs in this section are legacy APIs. Zuora recommends using the newer, faster APIs for managing products and catalogs more efficiently instead. For more information, see our latest [Commerce API](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/tag/Commerce/).

A product rate plan charge represents a charge model or a set of fees associated with a product rate plan, which is the part of a product that your customers subscribe to. Each product rate plan can have multiple product rate plan charges.

Product rate plan charges can be of three types: one-time fees, recurring fees, and usage fees. For example, the $50 activation fee for the Topaz product rate plan is a one-time product rate plan charge.
