# Unit Of Measure

A unit of measure (UOM) is the definable unit that you measure when determining charges. For example, if a customer's subscription rate plan includes 20 licenses, then 20 is the quantity and license is the unit that the quantity measures.

You can customize the units of measure (UOM) your company uses to measure the use of your services; for example, minutes, people, seats, and licenses can all be units of measure.
