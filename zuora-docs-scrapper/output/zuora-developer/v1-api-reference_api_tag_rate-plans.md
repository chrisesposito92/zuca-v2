# Rate Plans

A rate plan is part of a subscription or an amendment to a subscription, and it comes from a product rate plan. Like a product and its product rate plans, a subscription can have one or more rate plans. Rate plans are sometimes called subscription rate plans. Rate plans that are part of an amendment are sometimes called amendment rate plans.

Rate plans represent a price or a collection of prices for a service you sell. An individual rate plan contains all charges specific to a particular subscription.
