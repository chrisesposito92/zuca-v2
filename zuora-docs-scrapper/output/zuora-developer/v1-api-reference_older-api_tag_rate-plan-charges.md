# Rate Plan Charges

A rate plan charge is part of a subscription or an amendment to a subscription, and it comes from a product rate plan charge. Like a product and its product rate plan charges, a subscription can have one or more rate plan charges. Rate plan charges represent the actual charges for the rate plans or services that you sell.

Rate plan charges are sometimes called subscription rate plan charges to distinguish them from product rate plan charges. Rate plan charges that are part of an amendment are sometimes called amendment rate plan charges for the same reason. The object name is RatePlanCharge – not SubscriptionRatePlanCharge nor AmendmentRatePlanCharge.
