# Document Properties

You can create, update, and retrieve custom document properties for a billing document. For example, a document property can be a custom name used for files generated for billing documents. Billing documents include invoices, credit memos, and debit memos.

**Note**: You can manage document properties for credit memos and debit memos only if you have the [Invoice Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement) feature enabled.
