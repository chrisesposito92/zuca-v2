# Metadata

The Metadata API in Zuora promotes a programmatic way to retrieve, compare, and validate metadata within Zuora tenants for performing create and update actions between the source and the target. To use this API for migrating metadata from a source tenant to a destination tenant, you should authenticate using credentials of the source tenant. The user will have to provide the client id and secret key from the source tenant.
