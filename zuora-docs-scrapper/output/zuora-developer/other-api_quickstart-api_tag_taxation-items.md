# Taxation Items

The TaxationItem object is used to add a tax amount to an invoice item. Z-Tax and third-party tax engines such as Avalara or Connect tax engine can create TaxationItem objects. Before you use the Taxation Item object, you have to configure Z-Tax, Avalara, or Connect tax engine, as the object's fields rely on the values you create during the configuration process.
