# Refunds

Zuora allows you to issue and track refunds on payments. Similar to external payments, users can enter external refunds to track refunds that have been performed outside of Zuora Payments (for example, by issuing a check). In addition, you can make electronic refunds using our supported payment gateways, which will automatically refund money to the customer.
