# Payment Schedules

The Payment Schedules feature enables you to collect a series of payments following customized timelines and rules. You have the flexibility to leverage a payment schedule to process either a single payment or multiple payments.
You can leverage this feature to split invoice or account balances into several installments, and then automatically process payments for the installments. Payment schedules can also be used to collect external payments made for the installments. Meanwhile, we’ve provided you the capability to easily manage and modify existing schedules, as well as to manually retry failed payments with updated configurations.
