# Product Rate Plan Definitions

**Note** - The APIs in this section are legacy APIs. Zuora recommends using the newer, faster APIs for managing products and catalogs more efficiently instead. For more information, see our latest [Commerce API](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/tag/Commerce/).

Use product rate plan definitions to reuse charges in different product rate plans. The Product Rate Plan Definition object is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. If you are interested, please reach out to your CSM.
