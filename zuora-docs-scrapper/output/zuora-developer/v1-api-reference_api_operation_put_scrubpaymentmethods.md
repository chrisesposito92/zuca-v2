## Scrub a payment method

This operation enables you to replace all sensitive data in a payment method, related payment method snapshot table, and four related log tables with dummy values that will be stored in Zuora databases.

This operation will scrub the sensitive data and soft-delete the specified payment method at the same time.

If you want to delete or anonymize personal data in Zuora, you must scrub the payment method before anonymizing the associated account and contact. See [Delete or anonymize personal data](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Responding_to_individual_requests_for_access%2C_correction%2C_and_deletion_of_data_under_applicable_privacy_laws#Edit_and_correct_personal_data) for more information.

**Note:** In order to use this operation, you must ensure that the **Scrub Sensitive Data of Specific Payment Method payments** permission is enabled in your user role. Contact your tenant administrator if you want to enable this permission. See [Scrub Payment Methods](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/L_Payment_Methods/Scrub_Payment_Methods) for more information.

Request

##### path Parameters

| payment-method-idrequired | stringThe ID of the payment method where you want to scrub the sensitive data. |
| --- | --- |

##### header Parameters

| Accept-Encoding | stringInclude the Accept-Encoding: gzip header to compress responses as a gzipped file. It can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for a response.If specified, Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of data, and the response contains a Content-Encoding header with the compression algorithm so that your client can decompress it. |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Encoding | stringInclude the Content-Encoding: gzip header to compress a request. With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. |
| Zuora-Track-Id | string <= 64 charactersA custom identifier for tracing the API call. If you set a value for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response headers. This header enables you to associate your system process identifiers with Zuora API calls, to assist with troubleshooting in the event of an issue.The value of this field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), and quote ('). |
| Zuora-Entity-Ids | stringAn entity ID. If you have Zuora Multi-entity enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you should not set this header. |
| Zuora-Org-Ids | stringComma separated IDs. If you have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you can use this header to specify which orgs to perform the operation in. If you do not have Zuora Multi-Org enabled, you should not set this header.The IDs must be a sub-set of the user's accessible orgs. If you specify an org that the user does not have access to, the operation fails. This header is important in Multi-Org (MO) setups because it defines the organization context under which the API should operate—mainly used for read access or data visibility filtering. If the header is not set, the operation is performed in scope of the user's accessible orgs. |
| Zuora-Version | stringThe minor API version.For a list of available minor versions, see API upgrades. |
