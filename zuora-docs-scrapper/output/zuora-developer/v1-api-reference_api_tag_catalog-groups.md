# Catalog Groups

**Note** - The APIs in this section are legacy APIs. Zuora recommends using the newer, faster APIs for managing products and catalogs more efficiently instead. For more information, see our latest [Commerce API](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/tag/Commerce/).

A catalog group is used to group a list of product rate plans with a specific grade.
