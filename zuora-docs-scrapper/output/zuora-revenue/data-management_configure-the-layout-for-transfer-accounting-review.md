# Configure the layout for transfer accounting review

Learn how to configure layouts to customize the display of fields for reviewing transferred accounting data.

When you are viewing the summary or details of the transferred accounting data, the displayed fields in the UI are based on layouts. You can configure your own layout to display only the fields that you are interested in for reviewing transfer accounting.

## Before you begin

The label name of the field that can be added to your custom layout is configurable. Complete the following steps to edit the field label name that is available for the transfer accounting layout:

1.  Navigate to Setups > Application. The Labels page is displayed by default.
2.  From the Data Category drop-down list, click Transfer Accounting Review Report. The fields under the selected category are listed. The Display Label column shows the label name that will be displayed in the transfer accounting layout.
3.  To edit the label name for a specific field, click the current display label name on the target line and type the desired label.
4.  Click the save icon to save your changes.
