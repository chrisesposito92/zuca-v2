2.  Hover the mouse over the line of the target role and click the pencil icon .
3.  In the Edit Role window, click Assign Orgs .
4.  From the Available Organization list, select the organizations that you want the current role to access.
5.  Use the arrow icon to move your selection to the Selected Organization list.
6.  Save your changes and close the window.

After the changes are saved, each user role can access and process the data only for the assigned organizations after the user logs in.
