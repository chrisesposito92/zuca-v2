# Changes to standard report layouts

Explore the new fields and report layouts added to predefined reports, enhancing data sorting and customization capabilities.

More fields which are related to subscriptions, rate plan charges, and charge segments, are added to the predefined reports and can also work as filters to help you sort out data more quickly.

Besides, new report layouts that are specific to charges and charge segments are added to the predefined reports as listed in the following table. You can create your own report layout based on these standard layouts.
