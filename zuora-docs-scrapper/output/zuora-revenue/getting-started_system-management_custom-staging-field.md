# Custom staging field

The custom staging field names in Zuora Revenue are used for configuration tasks like field mapping and filter criteria creation.

The staging field names are displayed in many places in the Zuora Revenue UI for you to complete configuration tasks, such as customizing field mapping in a transaction upload template or creating filter criteria in an RC grouping template.

All the existing staging fields are categorized and displayed on the Labels page when you navigate to Setups > Application .
