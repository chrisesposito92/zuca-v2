# Email notifications

Learn how to enable email notifications for key revenue processes in Zuora Revenue to keep users informed of important updates.

The email framework provides a monitoring feature of the key revenue processes in Zuora Revenue. You can enable email notifications for specific users or user groups so that they can get notified of the important processes in Zuora Revenue. Currently, the email notification functionality supports email notifications for the following processes:

-   Holds apply and release
-   Period open and period close
-   Revenue contract approval
-   Schedule jobs
-   Schedule reports
-   Download report
-   Schedule Jobs failed

Note:

Email notifications from the email framework are different from password reset notifications. If you can receive password reset notifications, it does not necessarily mean that email notifications have been enabled for you.

The implementation partners and the Zuora Support team use the following procedure to enable the email notification functionality in the sandbox and/or production environments.
