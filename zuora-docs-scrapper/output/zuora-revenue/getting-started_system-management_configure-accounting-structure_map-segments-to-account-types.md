# Map segments to account types

Learn how to map segments to account types and customize account number generation for each segment.

After an account type is created, all segments that are defined on the Account Setup page are mapped to this account type. You can customize how the account number of the current account type is to be generated for each segment by editing the account map.

Complete the following steps to edit the account map:

1.  Navigate to Setups > Application .
2.  Click the left pointing arrow to open the side menu and click Accounting Setup . The Account Setup page is displayed.
3.  If the accounting setup is frozen, click Unfreeze on the Account Setup page and then click Account Type .
4.  Hover the mouse over the line of the target account type and click the Edit Account Map icon on the right. The Edit Account Mapping window is displayed.
5.  Click the target segment line and use the Segment Source , Source Field , or Constant Value columns to specify how the account number is to be generated for the selected segment.
6.  After you complete editing, click the save icon and close the window.
7.  If you complete all the accounting setups, go back to the Account Setup page and click Freeze .
