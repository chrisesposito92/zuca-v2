# Variable consideration processing

Zuora Revenue can automatically generate variable consideration (VC) estimates for sales order lines.

After you complete the required setup in Zuora Revenue for variable consideration (VC) processing, Zuora Revenue can automatically create VC estimates when a sales order line is collected. This VC estimate is the system applied VC. Alternatively, you can also upload VC estimates or actuals to Zuora Revenue by using file upload. After that, Zuora Revenue can perform different VC-related operations based on the uploaded file, such as updating VC estimates, clearing VC actuals, or canceling final actuals.
