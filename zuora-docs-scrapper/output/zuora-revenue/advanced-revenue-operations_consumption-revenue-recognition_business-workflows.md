# Business workflows

Zuora Revenue offers comprehensive business workflows for both standalone and Billing - Revenue Integration users, featuring Usage Tracking, Revenue Recognition, Variable Considerations, Revenue Analytics, and Operational Reporting.

The following diagrams illustrate how Zuora Revenue envisions the business workflow. No matter whether you are a Zuora Revenue standalone user or a Billing - Revenue Integration user, you can benefit from the out-of-the-box features in regard to Usage Tracking, Revenue Recognition, Variable Considerations, Revenue Analytics, and Operational Reporting. These common features are explained below.

For Billing - Revenue Integration users, the integration layer in the middle of the diagram is the true differentiation. These integrations include data sync and transformation from subscriptions and invoices in Zuora Billing to revenue contracts in Zuora Revenue as well as the automation in transferring consumption and usage data from Zuora Billing to Zuora Revenue.

Usage Tracking

With this feature, the usage data from the upstream system can be manually uploaded from the UI into Zuora Revenue or automatically synced to Zuora Revenue if Billing - Revenue Integration is enabled.

Revenue Recognition

Two methods for consumption revenue recognition are provided. Revenue can be recognized either ratably over the term of the contract and released upon booking, or based on invoice and released at the maximized invoiced amount.

Variable Considerations (VC)

The Consumption Revenue functionality can also manage consumption models that are deemed stand-ready under the revenue policy where variable considerations accounting is necessary.

Revenue Analytics

Revenue insights are available for you to track and manage consumption events, usage events, and revenue actions.

Operational Reporting

Consumption usage data are applicable to standard reports.
