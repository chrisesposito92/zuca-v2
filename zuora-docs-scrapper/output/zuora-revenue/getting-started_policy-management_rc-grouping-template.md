# RC grouping template

Learn how to create and configure RC grouping templates to establish revenue contract grouping rules in Zuora Revenue.

Before the transaction data or the cost data can be uploaded to Zuora Revenue, the revenue contract grouping rules must exist so that revenue contracts can be formed based on these grouping rules. To configure the grouping rules for Zuora Revenue, you create and then configure the RC grouping template. Each grouping template can contain a hierarchy of multiple grouping rules.

Note:

If you want to edit an existing RC grouping template that is in use instead of creating a new template, you must first end the current version by specifying an end date for the template. A new version of the template will be created for you to make updates. This requirement is to ensure that your updates do not impact the existing data.
