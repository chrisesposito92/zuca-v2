# Refresh timelines

Timelines for refresh requests depend on data volume and operational requirements, with estimates ranging from 48 to 96 hours.

Refresh request timelines are based on customer data volume and operational time that is required to act on the request.

| Size | Estimated time |
| --- | --- |
| Low to Moderate volume | Up to 48 hours |
| Large volume | Up to 72 hours (3 days) |
| Above Large volume | Up to 96 hours (4 days) |

To triage high-priority production issues, best-effort will be made to make the system available as soon as possible.

All request refreshes are entertained during business days only.
