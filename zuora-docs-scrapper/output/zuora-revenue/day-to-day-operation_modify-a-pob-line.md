# Modify a POB line

Learn how to modify a POB line by changing its name, expiry date, or template, merging it with another line, or moving it to a different POB.

On the Revenue Contract Detail page, you make the following changes to a POB line with the line-level action menu if the line is eligible for the changes:

-   Change the POB name, expiry date, or template This is a POB-level operation. Switch to the POB view to use this menu option to change the POB name, expiry date, or POB template of the POB line.

    -   If the POB line has been 100% released, you can change only the POB name of the line.

    -   If the POB line has been partially released, you can change the POB name and the expiry date of the line.

    -   If the POB line has not been released at all, you can change the POB name, expiry date, and the POB template.

-   Merge a POB line with another This is a POB-level operation. Switch to the POB view to use this menu option to merge a POB line to another POB line within the same revenue contract. This operation applies only to the POB line that has not been released.

-   Move a line to a POB This is a line-level operation. Switch to the Line view to use this menu option to move one line to a new or existing POB line. This operation is applicable only if the POB line containing the target line has not been released.


Note:

If a POB line has been released, you cannot change its POB template, merge it with another POB, or move a line to it. To make the POB line eligible for these operations, you must manually defer the line.
