# Manage user and group provisioning in OneID

Learn how to manage user and group provisioning in OneID, including creating, modifying, and setting user roles with an Administrator account.

Your user provisioning decides how you can create, modify, and set user roles. Provisioning users and groups via OneID requires an Administrator account.

User-provisioning functions can be performed using the following configurable options in OneID.
