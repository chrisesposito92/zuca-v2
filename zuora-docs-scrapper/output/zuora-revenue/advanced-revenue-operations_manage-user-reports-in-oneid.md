# Manage user reports in OneID

Learn how to manage and export user reports in OneID, enabling administrators to efficiently handle user data across Zuora tenants.

OneID enables Admins to export a report of their users, roles, and access levels across Zuora tenants. You no longer have to log in to each tenant separately to generate user management reports for auditing purposes. Only users with the Admin role in OneID can access this feature, which allows them to create, download and delete user management reports.
