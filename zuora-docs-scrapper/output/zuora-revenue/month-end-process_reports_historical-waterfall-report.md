# Historical Waterfall Report

The Historical Waterfall Report provides revenue data for up to 13 periods from any selected historical period, allowing you to analyze past revenue activity.

The Historical Waterfall Report generates revenue data for up to 13 periods from any historical period you choose. For example, if your current open period is May 2023, you can run the report to generate data from January 2022 to December 2022 to generate a Historical Waterfall Report for your prior year.
