# Auto POB

The AUTO POB template is used by Zuora Revenue to assign transaction lines to performance obligations when no specific POB assignment rules are configured or applicable.

If no POB assignment rules are configured or applicable, Zuora Revenue assigns the AUTO POB template to the transaction lines within a revenue contract. The AUTO POB template is predefined by Zuora Revenue and can be customized to meet your business needs.

The application of the AUTO POB template is to ensure that every transaction line in a revenue contract is mapped to a performance obligation. When the AUTO POB template is assigned to a transaction line, you cannot view the POB rule name in the Workbench.
