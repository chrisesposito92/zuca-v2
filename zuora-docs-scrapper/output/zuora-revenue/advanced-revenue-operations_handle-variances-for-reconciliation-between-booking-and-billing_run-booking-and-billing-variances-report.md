# Run Booking and Billing Variances Report

The Booking and Billing Variances Report identifies transactions in Zuora Revenue where booking and billing amounts differ, aiding in reconciliation.

The Booking and Billing Variances Report allows you to capture all transaction lines in Zuora Revenue where the booking amount does not equal the billing amount. This report is only available if you have enabled the Billing - Revenue Integration feature.

The benefits of this report include:

-   Provides visibility on the transactions where the booking amount mismatches the billing amount for an accounting period.

-   Presents the reason code for variances, which eases your reconciliation process.


To understand the common scenarios where variances between booking and billing occur, see [Handle variances for reconciliation between booking and billing](/zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations/handle-variances-for-reconciliation-between-booking-and-billing).

## What to do next

Based on the generated report, you can [manually upload MJE](/zuora-revenue/month-end-process/manual-journal-entries/mje-upload) in Zuora Revenue to resolve the issue.
