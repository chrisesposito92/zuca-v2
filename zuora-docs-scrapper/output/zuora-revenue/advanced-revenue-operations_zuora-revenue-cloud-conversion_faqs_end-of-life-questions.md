# End of life questions

This reference lists questions asked frequently about the end of life of the product.

Q: What software versions are end of life (EOL)?

A: The EOL versions include RevPro 3.6 and all previous versions prior to 3.6.

Q: How will the customers be supported after the EOL date?

A: After the EOL date, if you use RevPro 3.6 and the maintenance releases or builds are up to date, you will have an option to buy Extended Support for an additional 12 months. There will be an uplift for the extension. Work with your Account Executive to get the quote for the pricing. During this period, you will receive only the critical fixes that are mandatory to run the application. Extended Support is limited to the following items:

-   Around the clock self-solve support

-   Access to technical support engineers

-   Access to existing patches and hotfixes that are created when the product version was in Committed Support.


No new enhancement requests, patches, fixes, documentation changes, or platform certifications will be made for product versions that are in Extended Support.

The platform certification matrix for the classic UI and the new UI is as follows:

| RevPro version | DB version | Apex | Foex | UI layer | Tomcat | Nginx | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3.0 classic UI | 12.1.0.2/11g | Apex 4.2.6 | 2.2.7 | ORDS 3.0.6 | Tomcat 6 or higher | - | The classic UI will be in sustaining support mode. |
| 3.0 new UI | 12.1.0.2/12.2.0.1 | Apex 5.0.4 | - | ORDS 3.0.6 | Tomcat 8.x or higher | 1.3 or higher | The new platform certifications will be released in February 2020. |

Q: How will EOL impact RevPro 2.3 and 2.4 versions (ASC 605 engine)?

A: Both RevPro 2.3 (including ABAP stack) and RevPro 2.4 product lines are built to support ASC 605 guidelines. As ASC 606 adoption dates have passed for both public and private companies, Zuora will provide sustaining support until the end of life period.

Sustaining support is limited to the following:

-   Around the clock self-solve support

-   Access to technical support engineers

-   Access to existing patches and hotfixes that are created when the product version was in Committed Support.


No new enhancement requests, patches, fixes, documentation changes, or platform certifications will be made for product versions that are in Extended Support.

The platform certification matrix for RevPro 2.3 and 2.4 is as follows:

| RevPro version | DB version | Apex | Foex | UI layer | Tomcat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.3 | 12.1.0.2/11g | Apex 4.2.6 | - | Apex Listener 2.1 | Tomcat 6 or higher |
| 2.4 | 12.1.0.2/11g | Apex 4.2.6 | 2.1.0 | ORDS 2.0.10 | Tomcat 6 or higher |
