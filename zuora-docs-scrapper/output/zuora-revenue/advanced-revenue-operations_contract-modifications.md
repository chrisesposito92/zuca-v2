# Contract modifications

Contract modifications involve changes to performance obligations, such as price or scope adjustments, and can impact revenue recognition.

Contract modifications occur when there are changes to performance obligations (POBs) after the creation of a contract. Either price changes or scope changes to performance obligations can result in contract modifications. Contract modifications can also be the addition of new POBs to a contract or subtraction of existing POBs within a contract.

There is no limitation for the number of times that a contract gets amended. The amendment in the contract also impacts revenue recognition based on the type of changes. The following examples list some contract changes that result in contract modifications. All these changes occur after the initial contract timeline and during the contract revision timeline.

-   Contract additions
-   Contract cancelation
-   Contract change (upsell/downsell)
-   Merging contracts
-   Price adjustments
-   Price concessions
-   Price modifications
-   Returns
