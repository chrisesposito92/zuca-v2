## Before you begin

It is not required but recommended to perform soft freeze in Zuora Revenue before you close or open a period.

Soft freeze can ensure that there is no discrepancy in the closing balance. When a job or an action is locked for a soft freeze before you close or open a period, other Zuora Revenue users cannot start the job or action to bring in changes to Zuora Revenue. For more information, see [Set up soft freeze](/zuora-revenue/month-end-process/reports) .
