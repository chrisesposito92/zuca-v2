# Zuora Revenue UI

Learn how to navigate and utilize the Zuora Revenue UI, which is continuously evolving to enhance user experience, and understand its compatibility with the Chrome browser.

To access various functions and configuration settings, you need to log in to Zuora Revenue and then interact with the user interface (UI) frequently. It is a continuous effort for Zuora to keep improving the user interface for a better user experience. Before a new generation of Zuora user interface has completely replaced the previous one in all environments, you might have to interact with both legacy UI and new UI at the same time.

Note:

The Zuora Revenue UI is compatible with the Chrome browser only.
