3.  In the New Data Augmentation window, specify the following information:

    |  | Field name | Description |  |  | Book Name | Select the name of the primary revenue book. The augmented data for the primary book will be copied to any other additional (non-primary) revenue books. | Sequence | Sequence to apply data augmentation rules. | Rule Name | Enter a unique name of the data augmentation rule. | Start Date | Enter a start date for the data augmentation rule. It is important to note that the data augmentation rule becomes effective at the beginning of the next accounting period following the start date. For example, if the start date is January 15, 2020, the rule will be effective starting February 1, 2020. To make the data augmentation rule effective immediately, choose a start date in the prior accounting period. | Description | Enter a description for the data augmentation rule. | End Date | Optionally enter the end date. | Enabled | Toggle to Yes to enable the data augmentation rule. | Processor Type | Select RC_COLLECT . | Stage Name | Select the appropriate stage to apply the data augmentation rule. |
