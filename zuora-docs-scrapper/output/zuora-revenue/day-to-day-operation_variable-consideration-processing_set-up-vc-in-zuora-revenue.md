# Set Up VC in Zuora Revenue

Learn how to set up VC in Zuora Revenue by enabling the VC profile and completing mandatory setups.

For Zuora Revenue to automatically apply VC estimate to transactions, ensure that the ENABLE\_VC profile is set to Yes on the Setups/Application page. Then, complete the following mandatory setups:

1.  Create VC-related accounts, which are required for all VC types. See [Accounting setup](/zuora-revenue/day-to-day-operation/variable-consideration-processing/set-up-vc-in-zuora-revenue/configure-accounting-setup).
2.  Configure VC policies, which include VC types, formulas, or VC rules. See [Policy setup](/zuora-revenue/day-to-day-operation/variable-consideration-processing/set-up-vc-in-zuora-revenue/configure-policy-settings).
3.  Edit the POB template to specify VC assignment information. See [setup POB template](/zuora-revenue/day-to-day-operation/variable-consideration-processing/set-up-vc-in-zuora-revenue/set-up-pob-template).
