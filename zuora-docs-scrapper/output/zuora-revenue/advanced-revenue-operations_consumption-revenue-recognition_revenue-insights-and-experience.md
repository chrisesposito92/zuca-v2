# Revenue insights and experience

Learn how to track and manage consumption events, usage history, and revenue events in Workbench using the Revenue Contract Detail page.

After usage transactions are processed, the Revenue Contract Detail page in Workbench provides the following windows or tables to track and manage consumption events, usage history, and revenue events.

| Workbench element | Use case addressed |
| --- | --- |
| Consumption History | The Consumption History window presents the consumption event details at the SO line level. You can use it to do a quick analysis of revenue accrual versus usage transactions within Zuora Revenue. |
| Usage History | The Usage History window presents the usage transaction details at the SO line level. You can use this window to see the Usage Sync and/or Consumption Upload records at the line level to know when and how the usage transactions flowed into Zuora Revenue. If the usage record is manually uploaded to Zuora Revenue and the status is being tracked or yet to be recognized, the user can also cancel the record directly from this window. |
| Revenue Action | The Revenue Action window presents the consumption-related revenue events at the POB level. You can use this window to follow how much and when the usage revenue was released from a POB level as the revenue contract progresses through the lifecycle. |
