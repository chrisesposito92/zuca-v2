# Manually defer or release the POB line

Learn how to manually release or defer a performance obligation (POB) line using the Release/Defer POB menu option in Workbench.

If the performance obligation (POB) of the line is created based on the POB template that allows manual release, the Release/Defer POB menu option is available for you to manually release or defer the line in Workbench. Use this menu option on the revenue contract level to release or defer multiple lines at the same time based on the same percentage. Use this menu option on the POB line level to release or defer one line based on the percentage or an amount.
