# Long-term and short-term reclassification

In Zuora Revenue, the balance in your Contract Liability account as of the current period end can be reclassified as long-term and short-term accounts based on the future revenue waterfall. This process is referred to as long-term and short-term reclassification (LT/ST Reclass) in Zuora Revenue. This reclassification process also covers the Allocation Adjustment Liability account and cost-accrual account.
