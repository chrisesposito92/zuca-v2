| Task | Activity | Description |

| 1 | Run the RevPro3.0 Netting Process program. | This task is to calculate the CA/CL balance and net position of each RC in the new current open period. The ending CA/CL balance of the prior period and the net position is carried forward to the new period. |
| 2 | Run the RevPro3.0 Reporting Period Open program. | This task is to carry forward all balance sheet account balances at the account level from the prior period to the new current open period. So that the correct amounts can be reflected on the reports. |
