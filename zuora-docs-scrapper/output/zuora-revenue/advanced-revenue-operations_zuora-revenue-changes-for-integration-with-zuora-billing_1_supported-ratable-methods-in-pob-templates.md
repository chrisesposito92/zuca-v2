# Supported ratable methods in POB templates

Learn about the supported ratable methods in POB templates when the Billing - Revenue Integration feature is enabled in Zuora Revenue.

When the Billing - Revenue Integration feature is enabled in Zuora Revenue (ZBILLING\_INTEGRATION=Yes), only the following ratable methods can be supported when you define a POB template in Zuora Revenue:

-   Ratable

-   Invoice Ratable

-   Immediate Using Start Date

-   Immediate Using Open Period


Other ratable methods are disabled because they are not applicable to the integration scenarios.
