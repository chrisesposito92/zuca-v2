# Period-open activities

Learn how to initiate and manage the period-open process in Zuora Revenue, including running predefined programs and validating data.

When there is no open period in Zuora Revenue, you can start the period-open process.

## Overview

As part of the period-open process, you must run several predefined programs in sequence and validate data in various reports before you can close a period.

Note:

The period-open tasks listed in the following section are recommendations that can help ensure data accuracy. You can decide the required period-open tasks based on your own business needs.

To complete the period-open tasks, you can choose to manually complete them by navigating between various UIs. Alternatively, you can create a period-open template and add the tasks to this template. In this way, you can perform the period-open tasks in one central UI. For more information, see Create Period Close/Open templates .

If a period-open template is enabled in the system, you must perform the period-open tasks as defined in the template. For more information, see [Open a period based on a template](/zuora-revenue/month-end-process/period-open-activities/open-a-period-based-on-a-template). If there is no period-close template enabled, follow the instructions in [Open a period without a template](/zuora-revenue/month-end-process/period-open-activities/open-a-period-without-a-template) .
