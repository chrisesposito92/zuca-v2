# Event processing

Zuora Revenue supports configurable event-based processing, enabling the upload and execution of events for revenue release, cost release, and hold actions.

In Zuora Revenue, events can be configured and triggered for revenue release, cost release, and holding the revenue or cost. After the required configuration is completed, you can upload event data to Zuora Revenue and then start the event process for Zuora Revenue to process the uploaded events.
