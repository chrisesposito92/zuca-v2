# Set up profiles

Follow these steps to view or change profile values using the application setup menu.

To view or change the values of a profile, complete the following steps:

1.  Navigate to Setups \> Application .
2.  Click the the left pointing arrow to open the side menu and then click Profiles .
3.  Use the Category list and/or the search box to quickly locate the target profile.
4.  Hover the mouse over the profile line and then click .
5.  In the Edit Profile window, update the System Level Value field for the profile. Other fields in grey are not editable.
6.  Click the save icon and then close the window.

As an alternative to configuring some important functionalities with profile settings, you can also navigate to Setups > Application > Functionality to complete the high-level configuration on one single page. Settings on the Functionality page has the same effect as the profile setting. Whichever is last updated will override the counterpart.
