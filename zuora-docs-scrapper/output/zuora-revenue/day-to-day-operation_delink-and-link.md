# Delink and link

Zuora Revenue allows authorized users to manually realign transaction lines, POBs, or revenue contracts using linking and delinking functionality.

After revenue contracts are automatically created based on the RC grouping templates, you can manually realign the transaction lines, performance obligations (POB), or revenue contracts with the linking and delinking functionality.

This functionality is available to the users whose role has the appropriate privileges to edit revenue contracts in the Workbench.

You can use the linking and delinking functionality in the Zuora Revenue UI or with custom APIs. The following instructions are for UI operations only.

For the delink procedure, see [here](/zuora-revenue/day-to-day-operation/delink-and-link/delink).

For the linking procedure, see [here](/zuora-revenue/day-to-day-operation/delink-and-link/link).
