# Test Zuora Revenue in different environments

Zuora Revenue provides different types of testing environments for you to test the Zuora Revenue application, APIs, and supported integration.

Note:

We have moved the articles on this page to the combined Zuora Environments page. See, [Zuora Environments](/basics/environments/zuora-revenue-testing-environments) .
