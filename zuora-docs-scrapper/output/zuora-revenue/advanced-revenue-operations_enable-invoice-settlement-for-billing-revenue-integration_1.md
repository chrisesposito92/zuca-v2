# Enable Invoice Settlement for Billing - Revenue Integration

With the [Invoice Settlement feature](/db/organizations/zuora/repositories/prod-sitemap/content/documents/external_publications/billing/invoice_settlement/Invoice_item_settlement/invoice_item_settlement.ditamap) enabled in Zuora Billing, credit and debit memos are available in your Zuora Billing tenant. Like invoices, credit and debit memos are legal documents vendors issue to their customers. They are used to correct charge mistakes on invoices and to manage the balance due on a particular invoice or account.

Billing - Revenue Integration supports syncing and transforming the Credit Memo and Debit Memo objects into Zuora Revenue Line Staging tables. After Invoice Settlement is enabled in Zuora Billing, you must configure your Zuora Revenue accordingly to work with the Invoice Settlement feature.

## Prerequisites

-   Ensure that you have enabled the Invoice Settlement feature for your Zuora Billing tenant.

-   If you use the Invoice [Item Adjustments feature](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-item-adjustments/overview-of-invoice-item-adjustments) in Zuora Billing before and have the Revenue Sync job in Zuora Revenue scheduled for this feature, disable the scheduled job. You can enable the job again after the following procedure is completed.
