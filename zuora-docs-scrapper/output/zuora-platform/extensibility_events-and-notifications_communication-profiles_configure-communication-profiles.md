# Configure communication profiles

Learn the high-level process of configuring communication profiles, accounts, and notification settings to send notifications based on customer groups.

To send notifications based on customer groups, perform the following steps:

1.  [Create a communication profile](/zuora-platform/extensibility/events-and-notifications/communication-profiles/configure-communication-profiles/create-a-communication-profile).

2.  [Link the communication profile to customer accounts from that group](/zuora-platform/extensibility/events-and-notifications/communication-profiles/configure-communication-profiles/link-a-communication-profile-to-a-customer-account).

3.  Configure recipient information in email notifications. When sending email notifications, Zuora uses the recipient information configured in the related email templates. You can choose any email address of a customer account such as Bill To Contact, Sold To Contact, and so on. For more information, see [Email template overview](/zuora-platform/extensibility/events-and-notifications/email-templates/email-template-overview).
