# Order data source

Data source to report on information for a given order

Note:

This feature is only available if you have the Order Metrics feature enabled. As of Zuora Billing Release 284, Orders is generally available and the Order Metrics feature is no longer available as a standalone feature. If you are an existing Subscribe and Amend customer and want Order Metrics only, you must turn on Orders Harmonization . Join the [Orders Harmonization Community group](https://community.zuora.com/t5/Orders-Harmonization/gp-p/Orders-Harmonization) for more information. You can still keep the existing Subscribe and Amend API integrations to create and manage subscriptions.

Use the Order data source to report on information for a given order. See Overview of Orders for more information about orders.
