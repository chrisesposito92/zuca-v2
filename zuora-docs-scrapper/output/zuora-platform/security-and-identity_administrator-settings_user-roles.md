# User roles

Administrators can manage user roles and permissions from Administration Settings.

You must be an administrator in Zuora to assign permissions and roles. You can also create custom user roles to control user permissions at a more granular level.

## Standard user roles

The Zuora UI provides several types of roles, and each role type has its set of own privileges. Our standard Zuora roles include the following:

-   [Platform roles](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/administrator-settings/user-roles/platform-roles)

-   [Billing roles](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/administrator-settings/user-roles/billing-roles)

-   [Finance roles](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/administrator-settings/user-roles/finance-roles)

-   [Payment roles](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/administrator-settings/user-roles/payments-roles)

-   [Commerce roles](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/administrator-settings/user-roles/commerce-roles)

-   [Reporting roles](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/administrator-settings/user-roles/reporting-roles)


The roles available to manage can vary depending on the Zuora products you are using. If you are not using Finance, for example, the Zuora Finance Administrator role will not be available.

## API user role

If your tenant makes use of the Zuora SOAP APIs or REST APIs, create a special user role just for that purpose. For more information, see [Creating an API user](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/administrator-settings/manage-users/create-an-api-user/create-an-api-user-process-flow).

## Manage roles

Click your user name at the top right and navigate to .

You can do the following role management:

-   View the permissions associated with the selected role.

-   Assign or revoke permissions with the selected role.

-   [Create a custom role](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/administrator-settings/user-roles/create-a-custom-user-role) or remove a custom role.


## Assign a role to a user

Click your user name at the top right and navigate to .

You assign roles to users by managing users' accounts. When you [create a user](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/administrator-settings/manage-users/add-a-user), you must select a role for each of the role types.
