# Additional field details of InvoicePayment

Additional details of the fields of the InvoicePayment object.

## Id

The ID of this object. Every object has a unique identifier that Zuora automatically assigns upon creation. You use this ID later when you work with the object. For example, if you send an amend() call to modify an existing subscription, then you need to include the specific `Subscription` object's ID with the call.

The ID for the `InvoicePayment` object is `InvoicePaymentId` .

## RefundAmount

Specifies the amount of a refund that applied against this InvoicePayment. This read-only field is generated by the system, and exists only when a payment that was applied to an invoice is later refunded.

For example: An invoice is generated for $1000. An $800 payment is applied, then $300 of that payment is refunded. In this example, the amount of the invoice ( `Invoice.Amount` ) is $1000, the balance ( `Invoice.Balance` ) is $500 (= $1000-$800+$300), the refund amount ( `Invoice.RefundAmount` ) is $300, and the payment amount ( `Invoice.PaymentAmount` ) is $800.
