# Impact and next steps

The upgrade process is seamless with no impact or downtime, requiring no action from customers.

The upgrade process will not cause any impact or downtime for customers. You don't need to take any action to adopt these changes as all objects synced via legacy 360 will be migrated to the new sync. For additional information, questions, or concerns, refer to the Zuora Documentation Portal or open a support ticket with Zuora Global Support.
