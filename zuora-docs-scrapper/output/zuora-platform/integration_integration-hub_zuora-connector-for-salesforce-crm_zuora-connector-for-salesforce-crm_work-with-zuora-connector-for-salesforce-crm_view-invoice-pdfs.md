# View Invoice PDFs

This task topic explains how to view or download invoice PDFs generated by Zuora after synchronizing data with Salesforce CRM.

After Zuora Connector for Salesforce CRM synchronizes your invoice and payment data from Zuora to Salesforce, you can view or download from Zuora CPQ, the invoices Zuora generates.

Viewing invoice PDFs are not supported in Microsoft Internet Explorer.

The process involves the following steps:

1.  Configure zSchema as described in Import WSDL .
2.  Configure the connection settings as described in Configure Connection Settings .
3.  Synchronize Accounts and Related Objects from Zuora .
4.  View or download the invoice PDF.
    1.  On the Account page, click the invoice number you want to view.
    2.  To open the invoice PDF and view it, click View Invoice PDF . If you download the PDF from this window, the PDF file is downloaded as `download.pdf` or `document.pdf` depending on the browser you use.
    3.  To download the invoice PDF, click Invoice PDF . The PDF is downloaded in the invoice name, for example, `INV00000045_A00000079_01102017.pdf` .
