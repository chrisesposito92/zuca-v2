# Create a custom meter

Create a custom meter by using available components to meet specific business process requirements.

If the pre-defined meter types do not meet your business process requirements, you can create a custom meter using the available meter components. Drag and drop the meter components on to the meter stream window and configure the custom meter.

1.  Click Create Meter on the Meters home page.
2.  Enter a name for the meter and select Custom.
3.  Click Create, the Meter Stream window opens.
    The left panel displays a component library from which you can add components to build the meter.

4.  Start by clicking on the source selection box in the meter flow window and select a source.
5.  Configure and save the source.
6.  Click on the target selection box in the meter flow window and select a target.
7.  Configure and save the target.
8.  Add meter components between the source and target by clicking and dragging the components on to the meter flow window to design the flow of the meter and data between the source and target.
    You can add, delete, or clone components. You can move the flow arrows to connect components.

9.  Configure and save the component parameters.

The meter is created. Click the Test button to initiate a test run for the meter. Click Run to perform a live run.
