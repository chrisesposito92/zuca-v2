# Product Mapping

Map Google product identifiers to Zuora product rate plans to ensure accurate reflection of subscription changes and purchases.

Ensure that subscription changes and purchases from the Google Play Store are accurately reflected in Zuora by mapping Google product identifiers to Zuora product rate plans. :

1.  Go to the Product Catalog in Zuora.
2.  Select Rate Plans and choose the rate plans to map.
3.  Enter the Google product identifier (e.g., purchaseToken or other relevant Google identifiers) in the corresponding fields and add it to the ExternallyManagedPlanID field as needed.
4.  Save the mappings to link Google Play products with Zuora rate plans.
