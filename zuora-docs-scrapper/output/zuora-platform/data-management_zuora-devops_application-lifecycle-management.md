# Application Lifecycle Management

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) involves processes and tools for maintaining application development, testing, and deployments, integrating DevOps for efficient releases.

Application Lifefcycle Management (ALM) encompasses the entire software development process, while DevOps focuses on the methodology used within that process. For example, testing is a component of ALM. If an organization decides to incorporate automated testing through source code-driven development, the organization is leveraging DevOps practices. When ALM is synchronized with DevOps, the objective is to achieve quicker and higher quality releases.

Note: The ALM framework within the Zuora Billing Platform offers guidance on the best practices for working with Zuora CPQ and Zuora Connect for Salesforce.

The following image outlines the five typical phases in ALM:
