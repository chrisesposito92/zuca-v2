# Salesforce CPQ connector configuration guide

Guide to configuring the Salesforce CPQ connector in Zuora Marketplace, covering authentication, field configuration, and data synchronization.

The configuration begins in the Zuora Marketplace, where you access the Salesforce CPQ connector and authenticate with both Salesforce CPQ and Zuora using your environment-specific credentials. Once authenticated, you will configure key connector fields such as environment endpoints, tenant information, synchronization preferences, subscription handling options, and alert settings.

To enable seamless data flow between systems, you must create specific custom fields in Zuora on the Contact and Subscription objects. These fields store Salesforce identifiers and support accurate sync operations.
