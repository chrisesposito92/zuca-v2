# Create a function from templates

Learn how to create a function from built-in templates.

To create functions, you must have a basic understanding of JavaScript functions. For more information, see [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions) in MDN Web Docs.

1.  Navigate to in the left navigation menu.
2.  Click Create Logic and then click Create from Templates.
3.  In the “Choose a template from library” dialog, select the template on which the function is based:
    1.  Click Functions in the Categories section.
    2.  Select an object from the dropdown list.
    3.  Select a template in the Functions section. Available templates vary depending on the object you selected in step b.
4.  Optional: In the Create New Logic dialog, update the prepopulated information as needed:

    -   Name

    -   Description


5.  Click Save And Continue. The function editor opens.
6.  Optional: Update the JavaScript code and test the function. For more information, see [Test a function](/zuora-platform/extensibility/custom-logic/function/function-management/test-a-function).
7.  If you want to activate the function, click Activate. Active functions are effective immediately, whereas draft functions are not. Note that only one active function is allowed for each object.
8.  Click Save.
