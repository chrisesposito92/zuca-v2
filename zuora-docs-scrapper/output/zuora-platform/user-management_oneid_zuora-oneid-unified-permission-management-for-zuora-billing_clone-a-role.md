# Clone a role

Learn how to create a copy of an existing role, including its permissions, without copying assigned users.

Cloning a role creates a copy of an existing role, including its associated permissions, but does not copy users assigned to the original role. You can make additional customizations to create a new role.

To clone a role:

1.  Navigate to OneID > Admin Console > User roles and permissions.
2.  Click the ellipsis icon next to the role you want to clone.
3.  In the role information page, make the customizations required and click Save
