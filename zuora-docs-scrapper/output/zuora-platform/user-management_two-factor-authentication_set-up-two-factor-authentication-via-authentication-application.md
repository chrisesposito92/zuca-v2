# Set up two-factor authentication via authentication application

Learn how to set up two-factor authentication via authentication application.

1.  Log in to the Zuora UI. You will see a screen informing that you have been enabled for two-factor authentication.
2.  Click continue.
3.  Select Use a mobile app. You will be prompted to scan a QR code.
4.  Scan the code, using your preferred authentication application on your mobile phone or tablet.
5.  Click next.
6.  Enter the authentication code generated by your application.
7.  If you don't want to be prompted to enter another code on that particular machine and browser for 30 days, select the Remember me for 30 days checkbox. If you sign in to Zuora from various machines or browsers, you must set up 2FA for every machine or browser. If you set up Two-factor authentication on a trusted machine and safe browser, that you use to access Zuora regularly, Zuora recommends enabling Remember me for 30 days. If you access Zuora on a public machine or unsafe browser, Zuora does not recommend enabling Remember me for 30 days.
8.  Click next. After you've entered the correct authentication code, a success message will be displayed.
