# Create a new Zuora Managed Key

Create and manage encryption keys using AWS Key Management Services through Zuora's secure interface.

Zuora uses the AWS Key Management Services (AWS KMS) to manage the storage of your encryption keys. Instead of managing the encryption keys at your end with a separate infrastructure, we provide a secure option that is built on top of AWS to create and manage your encryption keys.

1.  In OneID, navigate to Admin console > Encryption Key Management in the left-hand navigation section
2.  On the Zuora keys page, click Create New Key .
3.  Add a Key Name and enable the auto rotation toggle. The automatic key rotation option helps in automatic key rotation (creating new keys) every year.
4.  Click Save .
