# Generate a security token

This article describes how to generate the Salesforce security token.

You need to know your Salesforce security token when you manually sync your data from Zuora to Salesforce.

To generate a new security token:

1.  In Salesforce, navigate to .
2.  On the Reset My Security Token page, click Reset Security Token . You will need this token each time you manually sync your Zuora account with your Salesforce account record.

    Note:

    Important: If you are using this Salesforce account for additional integration tasks, you must update all other applications or integration that are currently using your security token with the new security token information.
