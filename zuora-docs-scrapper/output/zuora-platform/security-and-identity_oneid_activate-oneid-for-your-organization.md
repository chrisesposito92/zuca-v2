# Activate OneID for your organization

Learn how to activate OneID for your organization.

The access point of OneID is [one.zuora.com](https://one.zuora.com/?_gl=1*z27v8c*_gcl_au*MjA1NDEyODY1My4xNzU0ODk2MjE1*_ga*OTEzOTUyMDkzLjE3NDcwNDQyMjM.*_ga_MY8CQ650DH*czE3NTczMDI1MDgkbzIxNyRnMSR0MTc1NzMwNzA3MCRqMTMkbDAkaDM3NzM3MjAxNQ..).

Note: The administrator of your organization should normally perform this operation.

Before your organization can use this feature, you must activate it by taking the following steps:

1.  To enable OneID for your organization, you need to reach out to [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/) and provide detailed information about your first admin user in OneID. The details include the user name, work email, login name, and tenant IDs.
2.  Zuora creates the first organization admin user account for you. The key function of this initial admin user is to create and onboard other organization admins to your organization. All the organization admins can add standard users to your organization.
3.  Once Zuora has created the first organization admin user for you, an activation email will be sent to the working email of the administrator.
4.  After you receive the activation email, follow the prompts to complete the activation. Then you can log in to OneID ([one.zuora.com](https://one.zuora.com/)) using your credentials.

The activation of OneID is complete for your organization. You can now add other organization admins and standard users to OneID.

For more information about how to create users in OneID, see [Add users to OneID](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/oneid/users-in-oneid/add-a-user).
