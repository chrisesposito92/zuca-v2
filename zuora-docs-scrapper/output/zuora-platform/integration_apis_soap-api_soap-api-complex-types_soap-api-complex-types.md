# SOAP API complex types

SOAP API complex types are essentially custom data structures, similar to classes or models in programming languages.

The complex types are used by the Zuora API calls and let you set multiple values or read the results of call actions. Zuora SOAP API complex types are used to group attributes, and provide a convenient method of setting the values of those attributes.

Check the reference pages in this section to see all supported complex types.
