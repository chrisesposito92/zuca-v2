# Order Quantity data source

Data source to report on how different Orders and Order Actions change quantity over time

Use the Order Quantity data source to report on how different Orders and Order Actions change quantity over time. For example, let's say you create an Order Action that increases the number of users on a per unit charge. Assume that the charge starts out with 10 users, that this Order Action adds 5 more starting on 7/1/2017, and that the subscription term ends on 12/31/2017. This Order Action would create an Order Quantity metric with a Start Date of 7/1/2017, an End Date of 12/31/2017, and a Value of 5.

See Key Metrics for Orders for more information about order metrics.

## Availability

This feature is only available if you have the Order Metrics feature enabled. As of Zuora Billing Release 284, Orders is generally available and the Order Metrics feature is no longer available as a standalone feature.

The following objects and fields of the Order Metrics are end of support. Zuora no longer provides product support, and bug fixes or security issues are no longer addressed.

-   The Order ELP and Order Item objects

-   The "Generated Reason" and "Order Item ID" fields in the Order MRR, Order TCB, Order TCV, and Order Quantity objects


As of Zuora Billing Release 306, Order Metrics is no longer available. Zuora has updated the methodologies for calculating metrics in Orders . The new methodologies are reflected in the following Order Delta Metrics objects.

-   Order Delta Mrr

-   Order Delta Tcv

-   Order Delta Tcb


It is recommended that all customers use the new Order Delta Metrics . If you are an existing Order Metrics customer and want to migrate to Order Delta Metrics , submit a request at Zuora Global Support . Whereas new customers, and existing customers not currently on Order Metrics , will no longer have access to Order Metrics , existing customers currently using Order Metrics will continue to be supported.

If you are an existing Subscribe and Amend customer and want Order Delta Metrics only, you can turn on Orders Harmonization . You can still keep the existing Subscribe and Amend API integrations to create and manage subscriptions.

Note:

If the lengths of the charges in a subscription become 0, for example, due to a 0 subscription term, the Order Metrics will not be calculated.

Also, if a charge is updated on the charge end date or added to the subscription end date, the Order Quantity metric will not be generated. |
