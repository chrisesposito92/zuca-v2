# Access error logs to troubleshoot HubSpot connector

Learn how to access logs detailing successful and failed sync attempts within the Zuora System Health Dashboard.

The HubSpot connector offers in-app troubleshooting capabilities, allowing users to access and inspect post-sync logs without switching to the Zuora System Health Dashboard. This functionality is available when sync is triggered from accounts or deals, streamlining sales representative activities and enhancing troubleshooting convenience.

For example, during the synchronization of companies with deals, the process displays a Waiting for sync to finish status. As in this example screenshot, an error message is displayed that can be used for troubleshooting.
