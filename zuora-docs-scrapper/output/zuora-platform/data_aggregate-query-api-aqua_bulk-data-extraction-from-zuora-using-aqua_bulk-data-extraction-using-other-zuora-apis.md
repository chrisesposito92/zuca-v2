# Bulk data extraction using other Zuora APIs

Explains why Zuora Data Query API is not recommended for large-scale data exports and outlines Zuora's planned Bulk Query API for warehouse-level data extraction.

Zuora does not recommend using the Data Query API for bulk data extraction use cases.

The Data Query API is designed for operational scenarios that require limited amounts of near real-time data.

To support high-volume extraction, Zuora plans to introduce a Bulk Query API, which will allow customers to extract data from a warehouse-based, delayed copy of Zuora data.
