Explore and manage table schemas in your tenant using the Data Query Schema Browser, featuring search, sorting, and detailed field views.

## View objects in Schema Browser

You can use Data Query Schema Browser to view schemas of all tables available in your tenants. To access Schema Browser, click SHOW SCHEMA button on the Create Data Query page.

-   Show all fields for an object. Click the expand/collapse icon on the left side of each object to view all its fields. When expanded, all the field names and field types are listed under the object.

-   Search an object. Enter the object name in the search bar at the top of the Schema Browser pane and the list of result objects will be displayed underneath.

-   Change the sorting of objects. Click the sorting icon on the right side of the search bar to select Sort A to Z or Sort Z to A.


You can click HIDE SCHEMA button on the Create Data Query page to hide the Schema Browser pane.
