# Edit a workflow

Learn how to edit a workflow.

Ensure that the workflow definition is not in the active status. The active version of a workflow definition is not editable. You can only edit an inactive workflow version. You can still view the task details of an active workflow version by clicking the pencil icon on a task.

If there is only one version for the workflow definition and it is an active version, you need to create a new version to make modifications.

Editing a workflow involves two types of actions:

-   Design the flow of tasks, including adding, deleting, or cloning tasks, and connecting loose tasks.

-   Configure task parameters.


If a template perfectly fits your requirements, you may only need to configure parameters for tasks.

Note: Zuora recommends that you go through the list of workflow templates to see if you can find one that meets your requirements. Consider creating a blank workflow only when there are no templates that can be used.

1.  Open a workflow.
2.  Click the Versions tab.
3.  Click the Edit icon of an inactive workflow version.
