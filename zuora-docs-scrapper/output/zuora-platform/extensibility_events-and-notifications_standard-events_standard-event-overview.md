# Standard event overview

Standard events are pre-defined business events for Zuora Billing, Zuora Payments, Zuora Finance, and Zuora Platform. Zuora provides you with the supported standard events out of the box.

Standard events such as Invoice Due and Payment Processed are tied to customer transactions and actions. Zuora uses communication profiles specified on customer accounts to provide localized data in notifications related to these events. Other standard events, such as Bill Run Completion, do not have the context of customer accounts, thus default communication profiles are used.

## Supported standard events

To view the supported standard events in the Zuora UI, navigate to in the left navigation menu.

Note that events for Zuora Orders are Zuora custom events.
