# User provisioning via direct tenant assignment

User provisioning can be managed by assigning tenant access directly to users or through user groups for bulk provisioning.

## Overview

User groups will help you perform bulk user provisioning for users of the same type and access level. If you are still looking for a suitable group to assign the user or feel that grouping users is unnecessary, you may assign tenant access directly to the user and manage provisioning at the user level.

To grant tenant access with appropriate roles at the user level without adding them to groups, switch off the Direct Tenant Access toggle. For more detailed information, see [Assign tenants from the Users page](/zuora-platform/user-management/oneid/user-groups-in-oneid/user-provisioning-via-direct-tenant-assignment/assign-tenants-from-the-users-page) .

Note:

When the Direct Tenant Access toggle is disabled, users can be added to User Groups, and tenant access can be granted by adding the User Groups either on the user’s details page or from the Group details page.
