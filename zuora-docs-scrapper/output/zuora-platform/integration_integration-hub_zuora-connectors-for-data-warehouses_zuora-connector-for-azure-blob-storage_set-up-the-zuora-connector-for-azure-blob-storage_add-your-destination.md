# Add your destination

Add your destination

1.  After completing the initial setup, share your container name and access ID with a Zuora representative who will create a connection link for you.
2.  Using this link, you can securely input your Azure Blob Storage details, including the folder name, storage account name, and storage account SAS token.
3.  Once you fill in these details and test the connection, saving the destination will initiate the onboarding process and begin transferring data from Zuora to Azure Blob Storage.
