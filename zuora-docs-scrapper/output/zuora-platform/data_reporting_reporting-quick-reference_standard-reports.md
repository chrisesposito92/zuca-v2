# Standard reports

Reports that you can run with your subscription business data and get immediate value

Zuora Reporting provides standard reports that you can run with your subscription business data and get immediate value. See [Customize a Standard Report](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/use-reporting/customize-a-standard-report) for how to create a report by customizing a standard report.

The standard reports are organized into six categories:

-   [Standard Booking reports](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/reporting-quick-reference/standard-reports/standard-booking-reports)

-   [Standard Billing reports](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/reporting-quick-reference/standard-reports/standard-billing-reports)

-   [Standard Cash reports](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/reporting-quick-reference/standard-reports/standard-cash-reports)

-   [Standard Revenue reports](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/reporting-quick-reference/standard-reports/standard-revenue-reports)

-   [Standard Finance reports](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/reporting-quick-reference/standard-reports/standard-finance-reports)

-   [Standard Audit Logs reports](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/reporting-quick-reference/standard-reports/standard-audit-logs-reports)


The reports in each category are organized into three sub-categories:

-   Outcomes: Show how your business doing.

-   Drivers: Show what is driving the outcome.

-   Actions: Show what actions you might take to improve business outcomes in some way.


Navigate to Reporting > Standard Reports to access the reports. Each standard report is available as a summary report and as a detail report.
