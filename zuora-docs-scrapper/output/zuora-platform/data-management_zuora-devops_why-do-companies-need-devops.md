# Why do companies need DevOps?

DevOps is essential for companies to enhance customer experience, ensure faster and reliable software releases, and maintain competitive agility through continuous innovation and collaboration.

Monetization strategies are complex, but the customer and user experiences must be straightforward. Your monetization platform must provide a consistent customer experience throughout the customer journey, from subscribing to reading invoices to creating and modifying payment methods. The subscription platform's user experience must focus more on business users. It should be easy to use for accounting, finance, and IT admins who manage subscriptions and revenue.

Customers expect services to be available as they need them. Any disruption in the customer experience impacts customer satisfaction and trust. Businesses constantly need to innovate, maintain, and release faster. Implementing a DevOps strategy enables businesses to build a reliable, scalable solution that is resilient to issues, ultimately safeguarding the bottom line and ensuring the success of customer-facing initiatives.

Competition drives the need to "go live faster" and constantly " iterate" to improve the current application. Constant innovation is required to meet customer expectations, generate revenue, and maintain agility. This makes it even more compelling for subscription businesses to consider faster software release cycles for managing customer engagement and key success metrics like MRR, ARR, etc.

Businesses need to prioritize product readiness and improve the production environment to reduce time to market. DevOps' business value lies in faster releases, high quality, and the optimization of resourcing and tooling costs.

## Key drivers of growth in a DevOps strategy

-   Increasing demand for continuous and faster application delivery.

-   Increasing growth of microservices architectures over monolith applications. Microservices are created, tested and deployed independently, making it easier and faster to support releases and bug fixes whereas a monolith application requires a complete version release for new releases and makes it difficult to introduce changes.

-   Increasing demand for streamlining collaboration between IT and operations teams for breaking the silos and involving all the teams and SMEs engaged in software development and its lifecycle.
