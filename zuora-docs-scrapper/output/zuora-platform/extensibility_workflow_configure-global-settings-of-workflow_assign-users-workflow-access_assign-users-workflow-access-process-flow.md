# Assign users Workflow access process flow

As a Platform Administrator, you can manage users' access to Workflow by creating and assigning custom Platform Roles with different Workflow access permissions to the users.

By default, users with the Administrator role have all the Workflow access permissions enabled, and users with the Standard User role have all the access permissions except Workflow View Access enabled.

Follow the following process to assign Workflow access permission to a user:

1.  [Create custom platform roles](/zuora-platform/extensibility/workflow/configure-global-settings-of-workflow/assign-users-workflow-access/create-a-custom-platform-role-for-workflow)

2.  [Assign platform role to users](/zuora-platform/extensibility/workflow/configure-global-settings-of-workflow/assign-users-workflow-access/assign-a-platform-role-to-a-workflow-user)
