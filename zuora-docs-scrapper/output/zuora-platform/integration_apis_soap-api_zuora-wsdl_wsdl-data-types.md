# WSDL data types

This reference explains WSDL data types.

The WSDL has certain data types that the Zuora API uses. The following table describes these WSDL data types. Information on allowable lengths and values is documented with the specific calls.

| Data type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | A boolean data type can only have one of two values: true or false. These values can also be represented as true, yes, or 1 (one), or false, no, or 0 (zero). |
| date | A date data type represents a specific moment in time as a date only. See dateTime for more information about calculating the date value. |
| dateTime | A dateTime data type represents a specific moment in time as both a date and a time. It contains a year, a month, and a date, and also hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. The date range is 10,000 years, from January 1 of the year 1 to December 31, 9999.The value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Unlike local time, any given date and time in UTC is the same everywhere on earth simultaneously. Therefore, you may wish or need to convert this value from UTC to local time.Refer to the documentation for your development tool to see how it handles dateTime data types. And be aware of the differences in how dates are specified in different languages. For example, the month and day portion of a date can be interpreted as either dd/mm or as mm/dd.This data type can be very handy to specify in queries, as you can filter on the dateTime fields only.Some of the date fields in the API are automatically generated by the system, such as CreatedDate and UpdatedDate. |
| double | A double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point value. It is used for data that might contain decimal values. Double values might be limited as follows:precision : The sum of the number digits on both sides of the decimal point.scale : The maximum allowed number of digits to the right of the decimal point. The maximum number of digits to the left of the decimal place is calculated by subtracting scale from precision.With double values, if the number is large enough (for positive values) or small enough (for negative values), the values can be stored in scientific notation. For more information, see the W3C XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition specification. |
| int | An int (integer) data type is a whole number without a decimal point or any value that would follow a decimal point. For example, 1 is an integer. However, 1.0 and 1. are not integers. An integer can be a negative number. |
| long | The long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. This data type is generally used when the int data type is not large enough. |
| string | The string data type can contain characters, line feeds, carriage returns, and tab characters. |
