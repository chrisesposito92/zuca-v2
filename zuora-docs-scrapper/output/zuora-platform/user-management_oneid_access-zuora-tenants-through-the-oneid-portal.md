# Access Zuora tenants through the OneID portal

Use OneID to access Zuora tenants.

-   You must link a tenant user to your OneID user. For more detailed information, see Link tenant users to OneID.

-   If you use single sign-on (SSO) to log in to OneID, set a default tenant in OneID. For more detailed information, see Set the default tenant in OneID.


You can access your Zuora tenants in any of the following ways:

1.  Access a tenant from the Dashboard (expanded view).
    Click the tenant name.

2.  Access a tenant from the Dashboard (table view).
    Click Launch next to the tenant.

3.  Access a tenant from the Profile page.
    1.  Click your avatar in the top-right corner.
    2.  Click Profile.
    3.  In the Linked Users section, find the tenant by Tenant ID or Tenant Name, and click the tenant link.
        The tenant home page opens and you are logged in as the linked tenant user.

4.  Access a tenant when logging in with SSO.
    1.  Verify that a default tenant is set for your OneID user. When you log in with SSO, OneID automatically opens the home page of the default tenant in addition to the OneID portal.
    2.  Review SSO and default-tenant configuration if needed. For more information, see Configure SSO.
    3.  Open the tenant home page if your browser blocks it.

        Note that OneID opens the home page of your Zuora tenant in a new tab and your browser might block this page. If this happens, you need to open the blocked page manually, or change your browser settings to allow pop-up windows from Zuora OneID (

        [https://one.zuora.com](https://one.zuora.com/)

        ). Changing the pop-up window settings depends on the browser you use. Refer to your browser provider for more information..
