# Disabling sync processes

Learn about disabling sync processes

## Overview

You can disable the default sync processes and instead use custom processes. Zuora recommends that you disable sync processes only if you have created custom sync processes. If you disable a process without having a corresponding sync process available, Zuora Connector for Netsuite will not be able to correctly sync your data from Zuora to NetSuite.

Contact your Zuora representative for more information about creating custom sync processes.

See [Overview of the Integration between Zuora and NetSuite](/zuora-platform/integration/integration-hub/billing-connector-for-netsuite-gl/integration-between-zuora-and-netsuite) for more information about the sync processes.

## Credit Memo and Refund Sync preferences

By default, the NetSuite Credit Memo Sync and NetSuite Refund Sync processes are disabled. See [Credit Memo Transactions](/zuora-platform/integration/integration-hub/billing-connector-for-netsuite-gl/integration-between-zuora-and-netsuite/credit-memo-transaction-sync-netsuite-to-zuora) and [Refund Transactions](/zuora-platform/integration/integration-hub/billing-connector-for-netsuite-gl/integration-between-zuora-and-netsuite/refund-transaction-sync) for more information about these sync processes.

For steps to disable a sync process, refer to [Disable a sync process](/zuora-platform/integration/integration-hub/billing-connector-for-netsuite-gl/using-netsuite-connector/disabling-sync-processes/disable-a-sync-process).
