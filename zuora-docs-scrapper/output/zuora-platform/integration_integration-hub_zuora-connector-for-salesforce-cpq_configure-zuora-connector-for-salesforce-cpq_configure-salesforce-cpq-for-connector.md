# Configure Salesforce CPQ for Connector

Learn how to configure Salesforce CPQ by navigating to Setup, accessing the Installed Packages, and setting the Billing Plugin.

Zuora Finance provides a set of default accounting codes in Chart of Accounts. If you edited those out-of-the-box accounting codes or created additional accounting codes, you need to manually add the custom accounting codes.

1.  In Salesforce, navigate to Setup > Installed Packages.
2.  Click Configure for the Salesforce CPQ package.
3.  On the Settings page, click Plugins.
4.  In the Billing Plugin field, type ZSB.ZuoraBillingPlugin.
5.  Click Save.
