# Custom field overview

Custom fields provide you the flexibility to extend Zuora business objects when standard fields are insufficient for your business requirements.

Zuora supports a variety of custom field types, including Text, Integer, Boolean, Date, and Picklist. These fields allow you to store additional information on Zuora business objects, enabling you to tailor the data model to your specific business needs. With custom fields, you can capture business-specific attributes, improve system integration, and support unique workflows.
