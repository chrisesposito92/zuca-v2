# Manage single sign-on configurations

This guide explains how to manage single sign-on (SSO) configurations in OneID, including submitting SAML metadata URLs for identity providers.

This article describes how to manage your organization’s single sign-on (SSO) configurations in OneID. For more information about SSO in OneID, see [Configure single sign-on for OneID](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/oneid/configure-single-sign-on-for-oneid).

In the SSO SAML solution, identity providers (IdPs) and service providers (SPs) use SAML metadata to exchange interaction information. The metadata is in XML format and secured. To enable SSO SAML for your IdP in OneID, you must submit your IdP's SAML metadata URL to OneID.

Obtaining the SAML metadata URL depends on which IdP you choose. For more information about how to get the SAML metadata URL of Okta, see [Configure Okta for SSO SAML with OneID](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/oneid/setup-sso-with-okta-using-saml-in-oneid).
