# Compare configuration templates in GitHub

Learn how to compare configuration templates in GitHub using difference tools and split view for effective version management.

Difference tools in GitHub show changes inline, making it easy to view what has been changed in a file. Use the split view for a more comprehensive comparison, with the original file on one side and the modified file on the other. Here is an example of how this works with Configuration Templates and GitHub.

1.  Create a configuration template, for example - units of measure in Billing.
2.  Upload the template to the repository.
3.  Assume the units of measure configurations are modified the next day or later.
4.  Sync the template for refreshing the template with the latest configurations.
5.  Upload the template again in the repository.
6.  Click on the latest version of the file and the split view will provide the differences between the latest and the previous version
