# Link your Connect account to your Zuora account

Learn how to link your Zuora Connect account to your Zuora account so that you can purchase an app in Zuora Integration Hub.

You must have a Zuora Connect account. If you do not have a Zuora Connect account, you must create one in Zuora. You must also have a Platform role with API Write Access permission to link the accounts.

1.  In Zuora, navigate to .

    Zuora checks whether a Connect account with the same email address already exists. If yes, your Zuora Connect account is automatically linked with your Zuora account, and purchased apps are populated.

    If a Connect account with the same user email address does not exist, a page opens that prompts you to create a new Connect account.

2.  Once you choose to create a new account, specify basic information about your account.
3.  Complete two-factor authentication.

    You can choose authentication via text messages or Google Authenticator. Zuora verifies your two-factor authentication setup by sending a token to you by text message, or by asking you to generate a token on your device.

4.  Click Submit.

A new Connect account is created for you and automatically connected to your Zuora account. You are now ready to purchase and install apps in the Integration Hub.
