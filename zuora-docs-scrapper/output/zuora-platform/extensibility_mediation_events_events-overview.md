# Events overview

An overview of event data management, including ingestion, mediation, and analysis through the events dashboard.

An event represents transaction data from a service. After mediation, this data can be metered. Events are ingested into the dashboard from where you can create a custom view and analyze the event data.

To access Events, navigate to Mediation > Events in the left navigation menu. The Events landing page displays the events dashboard.
