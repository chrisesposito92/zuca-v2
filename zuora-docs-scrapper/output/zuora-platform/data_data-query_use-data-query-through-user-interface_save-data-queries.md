# Save data queries

Learn how to save, view, run, update, and delete data queries using the Data Query UI.

When you create a new data query through Data Query UI, you can save the query. You can then re-run the saved query in the future without constructing the SQL query again. You can access all the saved queries in your tenant.

Save your query

1.  Click SAVE QUERY upon completing the construction of your new query on the Create Data Query page. Click the query name of the saved query that you want to update in the list of saved queries.
2.  In the Save Query dialog, input the name and description of the query into the QUERY NAME and DESCRIPTION fields respectively.
3.  Click SAVE.
    Note that the max length of a query string that you can save is 20,000.


View your saved queries

4.  Navigate to Extension Studio > Data Query.
5.  Click the SAVED QUERIES tab on the Data Query page. The list of saved queries is displayed.

Run a saved query

6.  Click the query name of the saved query that you want to update in the list of saved queries.
7.  Click RUN QUERY on the query detail page.

Update a saved query

8.  Click the query name of the saved query that you want to update in the list of saved queries.
9.  Update the query on the query detail page.
10.  Click UPDATE SAVED QUERY.

Delete a saved query

11.  Hover over the query that you want to delete in the list of saved queries.
12.  Click the trash can icon on the right side of the query.
