# Set up Sync Credentials to Connect to Salesforce

Learn how to set up sync credentials to connect Zuora with Salesforce using either Salesforce or OAuth credentials.

When you synchronize data from Zuora to Salesforce, you have two options for connecting to Salesforce:

-   Use your Salesforce credentials

-   Use OAuth credentials


You can only use one authentication option at a time.

Note:

If you wish to change your authentication method, Zuora recommends you make the change during a period of zero to low activity to minimize in-flight synchronization errors.
