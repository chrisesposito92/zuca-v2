# Create an accounting period and run trial balances

Learn how to create individual accounting periods for each organizational unit and run trial balances for open periods.

When a new org. unit is created within the org hierarchy, an open-ended accounting period is automatically created for each new org unit. Users can later create an accounting period for the org unit based on their access permission.

Note: The accounting periods of all the child Org Units should be closed before closing the accounting period for the parent Org Unit.
