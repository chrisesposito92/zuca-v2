# Command Center process flow

This guide outlines the process for configuring and accessing OneID for Command Center, enabling secure access, single sign-on, and user provisioning across Zuora tenants.

This process flow provides an overview of how to configure and access OneID for Command Center. OneID serves as the centralized identity management system that enables secure access, single sign-on, and user provisioning across Zuora tenants.

1.  Ensure that you have administrator privileges in your organization. If you are a new user, complete the OneID activation setup to configure your account. If you are an existing administrator, contact your Zuora account team or raise a support ticket to request access to the EA of Command Center.

2.  Log in to OneID using your administrator credentials. Use the interface to manage user provisioning and configure access for tenants across your organization.

3.  After completing the setup, go to one.zuora.com and navigate to Home to open the Command Center portal. Verify that the correct tenants appear under your account.

4.  Identify the users who need access to Command Center. Assign the required roles and permissions to enable tenant provisioning. Once users are authorized, they can access applications without re-entering credentials for subsequent sessions.

5.  Use OneID to configure single sign-on (SSO) for seamless authentication across Zuora applications. Log in through your organization’s Identity Provider (IdP) to access any registered Service Providers (SPs).

6.  After completing these steps, confirm that users can log in to Command Center via OneID and access their tenants without repeated logins. Verify that OneID is correctly managing user provisioning and access permissions across all Zuora tenants.

7.  When the process is complete, OneID provides centralized user management, role-based access, and secure single sign-on for Command Center. You can now manage tenants, users, and permissions across your organization from a single, unified interface.
