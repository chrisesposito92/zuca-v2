# Upload: FTP and SFTP

This reference describes the Upload: FTP and Upload: SFTP task.

Note:

As of 2025.Q1.0.0, FTP upload is not longer supported. If you are using FTP upload, switch to SFTP Upload. To set up your SFTP server follow the FTP configuration [Task settings](/zuora-platform/extensibility/workflow/create-and-manage-workflow-definitions/workflow-reference/workflow-task-reference/upload-ftp-and-sftp/task-settings).

The FTP and SFTP upload tasks receive files from the preceding task and store the files to an FTP or SFTP server. The preceding task can be any task that outputs files, like the export, report run, or link task.
