# Add your destination

Add your destination

1.  After completing the initial setup, provide the host address of your SQL Server database to a Zuora representative. They will use this information to create a connection link for you.
2.  Using the provided link, you can securely input your SQL Server details, including the port, database name, schema, and authentication credentials.
3.  Once you fill in these details and test the connection, saving the destination will initiate the onboarding process and begin transferring data from Zuora to your SQL Server database.
