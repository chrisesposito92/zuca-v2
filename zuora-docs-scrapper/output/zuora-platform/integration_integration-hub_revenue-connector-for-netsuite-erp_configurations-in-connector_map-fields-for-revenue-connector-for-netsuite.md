# Map fields for Revenue connector for NetSuite

Learn how to map source and target fields for each object selected in the solution instance.

Connector field mapping does not support any transformation currently such as data type conversions, any conditional mapping, or setting default constant values. If you require these actions, you should consider using the Data Augmentation rule engine capability available in Zuora Revenue.

1.  From the Connector field mapping tab, select the solution instance from the dropdown.

    The corresponding objects from the selected solution instance are listed in the Object dropdown. The list of values (LOV) are also populated for both the source and target columns corresponding with the selected solution instance.

2.  Map the Source and Target fields based on the user or the business flow requirements.

    The columns change based on the object selected in the solution instance.

3.  Save your entries.
4.  Click Refresh to load the field metadata changes from NetSuite and Zuora Revenue.

You can cancel or undo mappings to retain previous mapping.
