# Zuora custom event overview

Zuora custom events are pre-defined events for Zuora Orders and other features, such as Prepaid with Drawdown and Unbilled Usage.

Similar to Zuora standard events, you can define notifications based on a Zuora custom event. When a Zuora custom event is triggered, Zuora will send all notifications associated with that event.

Zuora custom events are defined by Zuora and are not editable or deletable. If you want to create events for a particular use case in your business, use custom events or custom scheduled events.
