# Configure IdPs for SSO SAML with OneID

Follow these steps to configure Identity Providers (IdPs) for SSO SAML with OneID, including adding OneID to your IdP and submitting SAML metadata.

The high-level steps to configure IdPs are as follows:

1.  Add OneID to your IdP.
2.  Obtain SAML metadata of your IdP.
3.  Submit IdP’s SAML metadata URL to OneID.
    Note that you should perform this operation in OneID and not in your IdP.

4.  Assign OneID to IdP users.

The actual configuration procedure varies depending on the IdP you use. For more information about configuring Okta SSO, see [Configure Okta for SSO SAML with OneID](/zuora-platform/security-and-identity/oneid/setup-sso-with-okta-using-saml-in-oneid).
