# Create a rate plan for late fees

A high-level introduction of how to create a rate plan for late fees.

We'll create a rate plan "Late Fees" in product "Late Fee Product", and add a one-time charge of $5 to the rate plan. The rate plan should not include other charges.

The rate plan can be created in one of your existing products.

For detailed steps of how to create a product rate plans and product rate plan charges, see [Set effective start dates and end dates](/zuora-billing/set-up-zuora-billing/build-product-and-prices/set-up-product-catalog/set-effective-start-dates-and-end-dates) and [Create a product rate plan charge](/zuora-billing/set-up-zuora-billing/build-product-and-prices/set-up-product-catalog/create-product-rate-plan-charges/create-a-product-rate-plan-charge)
