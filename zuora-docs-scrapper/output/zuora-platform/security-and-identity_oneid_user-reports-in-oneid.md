# User reports in OneID

Learn how to manage and generate user reports in OneID, including global and tenant level reports, for auditing purposes.

OneID enables Admins to export a report of their users, roles, and access levels across Zuora tenants. You no longer have to log in to each tenant separately to generate user management reports for auditing purposes. Only users with the Admin role in OneID can access this feature, which allows them to create, download and delete user management reports.

Administrators can generate the following reports in OneID.

-   Global user report

-   Tenant level report


The section below provides an overview of the available user reports in OneID, detailing the fields and user data tracked at global and tenant levels.
