# Admin console overview

The admin console provides a centralized interface for managing user access, roles, system settings, and security policies, enhancing administrative efficiency and security compliance.

The admin console allows administrators to manage user access, roles, and system settings in a centralized interface. Below is an overview of the Admin Console’s key features:

-   Tenants: Manage different Zuora environments (e.g., production, test, development) with tenant-specific settings and access controls.

-   Users: Create, update, or deactivate users, and manage their application access.

-   User Roles: Define permissions for user roles, specifying actions users are authorized to perform within Zuora.

-   User Groups: Organize users into groups to simplify bulk permissions management.

-   Audit Logs: Track all administrative actions for security and compliance monitoring.

-   Support: Access documentation, troubleshooting guides, and customer support resources.

-   Recommended Features : Discover new or recommended OneID features to improve security and streamline configuration.


Under the Settings menu, administrators can access the following options:

-   Manage SSO Settings : Configure and manage Single Sign-On (SSO) settings for your organization. Enable SSO functionality for all users.

-   Manage OAuth 2.0 Clients : Create and manage OAuth 2.0 client credentials to facilitate user management in OneID via SCIM APIs.

-   Security Policies : Define and oversee security policies, including password requirements, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) configurations, and bulk user provisioning through user groups.
