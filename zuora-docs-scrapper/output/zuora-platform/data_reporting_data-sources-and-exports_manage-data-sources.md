# Manage data sources

Learn how to manage data sources

Reporting provides you with many data sources on which you can build reports. The data sources that are most commonly used for reporting purposes are listed by default to help users with data source selection.

An administrator with the Manage Data Sources permission can change that default display to customize the data sources that users will see initially when creating a report.

Every Reporting user who can create reports has access to all the data sources regardless of the default display setting, but only an administrator can change the default data sources display.

To customize the data sources that are displayed by default:

1.  From the Profile & Settings menu, select Reporting > Manage Datasources.
2.  Select the data sources to display by default. See [Reporting Data Sources](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/data-sources-and-exports/introduction-to-data-sources) for information about the available data sources.
3.  Click Save.

    You can use Restore Initial Settings to revert your changes.
