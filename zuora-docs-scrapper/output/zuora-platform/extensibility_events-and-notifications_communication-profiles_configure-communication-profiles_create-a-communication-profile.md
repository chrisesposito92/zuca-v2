# Create a communication profile

Learn how to create a communication profile.

1.  Navigate to in the left navigation menu.
2.  Click Manage Communication Profiles and then click \+ Add New Profile.
3.  In the Create Communication Profile dialog, specify the following information:

    -   Name: Enter the profile name.

    -   Profile Number: If you want to use your own profile number, replace the default value (`CP-xxxxxxxx`) in this field. Profile number is a value used to identify communication profiles and must be unique.

    -   Locale: Select the locale value that determines the date format in other features. For more information, see [Locale setting in communication profiles](/zuora-platform/system-management/additional-tenant-management-settings/dates-in-zuora/locale-date-formats#concept-ac-770__locale-setting-in-communication-profiles). Zuora uses your tenant locale setting for DEFAULT LOCALE.

    -   Description: Enter the description of the profile.
