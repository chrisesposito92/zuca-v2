# Order Mrr data source

Data source to report on how order actions change Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) for a subscription

You can use the Order Mrr data source to report on how order actions change Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) for a subscription.

For example, let’s say that you create an order containing the following order actions:

-   Add a rate plan with a recurring charge of $50 per month. The term starts on 1/1/2018 and ends on 12/31/2018. A 10% discount applies to the charge.

-   Remove the discount on 4/1/2018.


In this scenario, Zuora will create three Order Mrr metrics for the same charge:

| Start Date | End Date | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1/1/2018 | 12/31/2018 | Regular | 50 |
| 1/1/2018 | 12/31/2018 | Discount | -5 |
| 4/1/2018 | 12/31/2018 | Discount | 5 |

See Key Metrics for Orders for more information about order metrics.

## Availability

This feature is only available if you have the Order Metrics feature enabled. As of Zuora Billing Release 284, Orders is generally available and the Order Metrics feature is no longer available as a standalone feature.

The following objects and fields of Order Metrics are end of support. Zuora no longer provides product support, and bug fixes or security issues are no longer addressed.

-   The Order ELP and Order Item objects
-   The "Generated Reason" and "Order Item ID" fields in the Order MRR, Order TCB, Order TCV, and Order Quantity objects

As of Zuora Billing Release 306, Order Metrics is no longer available. Zuora has updated the methodologies for calculating metrics in Orders. The new methodologies are reflected in the following Order Delta Metrics objects.

-   Order Delta Mrr
-   Order Delta Tcv
-   Order Delta Tcb

It is recommended that all customers use the new Order Delta Metrics. If you are an existing Order Metrics customer and want to migrate to Order Delta Metrics, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/). Whereas new customers, and existing customers not currently on Order Metrics, will no longer have access to Order Metrics, existing customers currently using Order Metrics will continue to be supported.

If you are an existing Subscribe and Amend customer and want Order Delta Metrics only, you can turn on Orders Harmonization. You can still keep the existing Subscribe and Amend API integrations to create and manage subscriptions.
