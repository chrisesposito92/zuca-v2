# Payment Field Mappings: NetSuite to Zuora Sync (Invoice Settlement Enabled)

This document outlines the mappings for Payment sync from NetSuite to Zuora with Invoice Settlement enabled, highlighting potential differences in Source and Destination field associations.

Note:

This feature is currently in development and is subject to change without advance notice. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters.

This reference describes the mappings of the Payment sync from NetSuite to Zuora when Invoice Settlement is enabled for your Zuora tenant.

In some cases, the Source and Destination fields are associated with different objects.
