# Default behavior for CSV injection protection

The default CSV injection setting is Allow for existing tenants and entities, and Block for new ones, enhancing protection against CSV injection attacks.

-   For existing tenants and entities, the CSV injection setting is set to Allow by default. There is no change in behavior unless an administrator updates the setting.

-   For newly created tenants and entities, the CSV injection setting is set to Block by default to provide stronger protection against CSV injection attacks.
