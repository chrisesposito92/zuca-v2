# Using the GL Interface

Automate, manage, or manually run summaries, then download results as CSV files

You can create a schedule to have the summary runs performed automatically, view or revise available schedules, or start an ad-hoc summary run in the case of missed runs or errors. After a summary run completes successfully, you can download the exported file (in .csv format).

Refer to these topics for the next steps:

2.  [Perform an ad-hoc summary run](/zuora-platform/integration/integration-hub/configurable-summary-level-gl-interface/using-the-gl-interface/perform-an-ad-hoc-summary-run)

3.  [Download the file exported from a summary run](/zuora-platform/integration/integration-hub/configurable-summary-level-gl-interface/using-the-gl-interface/download-the-file-exported-from-a-summary-run)
