# Assign tenants from the Users page

Learn how to assign tenants from the Users page by navigating through the Admin Console and adjusting user permissions.

1.  Navigate to Admin Console > Users.
2.  Click Add New User. The New User page opens.
3.  Deactivate the Direct Tenant Access toggle from Basic Information. The tenant permission setting gets displayed.
4.  Activate the toggle under Permissions to allow access to tenants with appropriate user-level roles.
5.  Click Save. The tenant can now access the assigned user role without being part of a user group.
