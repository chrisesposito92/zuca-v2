# Object Manager overview

With the Object Manager feature, you can easily manage your custom fields and custom objects.

This feature provides you with the following abilities:

-   Manage custom fields on standard or custom objects.

-   Manage custom object definitions and records.

-   Understand the schema of your data model.


## Managing custom fields

Custom fields extend particular objects to accommodate your specific use cases.

You can use Object Manager to manage custom fields on standard objects or custom objects in a unified user experience.

## Managing custom object definitions and records

Custom objects extend the Zuora business object model to meet your business needs.

You can use Object Manager to manage custom object definitions and records.

For more information, see [Custom Objects](/zuora-platform/extensibility/custom-objects/custom-objects-overview).

## Understanding the schema of your data model

The Schema Visualizer feature provides an intuitive and visual representation of your data model. With this feature, you can understand the connections and dependencies between objects and field details of each object, such as lists of standard and custom fields, field types, and indexed fields.
