# Configure currency conversion settings

Learn how to configure currency conversion settings, including setting up functional currency and choosing exchange rate providers.

Users of the root org unit can configure exchange rate settings to be used for currency conversion. Exchange rate settings configured for the root org will be automatically inherited by the child orgs. Any further updates made to exchange rate settings at the child org level will be persisted on the child orgs only.

To enable foreign currency conversion, you must first configure your functional currency and specify if you want to use the default exchange rate provider or upload custom exchange rates. See [Manage Currency Conversion](/accounts-receivable/finance/zuora-finance-settings/currency-conversion-management/foreign-currency-conversion) to learn more.
