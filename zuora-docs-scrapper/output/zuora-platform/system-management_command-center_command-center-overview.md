# Command Center overview

Command Center provides a centralized platform for admins to manage and monitor tenant health and trust status using Zuora OneID.

The Zuora Command Center, hosted on [one.zuora.com](https://one.zuora.com/) and accessed via Zuora OneId, offers a centralized platform for administrators. It provides a range of functionalities, allowing them to effortlessly monitor system health, manage users, handle support tickets, access consumption metrics, and explore new features — all from a single location.

Zuora’s command center helps you with the following benefits,

-   Monitor system health: Based on your business needs, Zuora has integrated significant health components that use indicators to highlight information, issues, and warnings based on products such as payments, billing, invoicing, taxes, and more. You can drill a component to have an overall view of metrics at every level of the aggregation.

-   Multi-tenant management: In general, admins of an organization manage the roles and user access to different Zuora tenants. With command center, you can track multiple tenants in one place, manage their trust status, inspect a component to view metrics, and review their system health. For more information, see OneID .

-   Monitor Consumption: Monitor and assess usage to ensure it aligns with the objective. Evaluate the existing workflow using management tools to avoid inefficiencies caused by excessive or inadequate usage.

-   Connect Zuora Support: Access support tickets with a one-time authorization. Track and view existing tickets using filters or create new tickets without having the complexity of redirecting to the support page every time.

-   View performance dashboard for Support: Analyze support trends with performance analytics dashboards to view the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the tickets in queue, their average queue response time, the average duration of support conversations, and the number of new support conversations per day.
