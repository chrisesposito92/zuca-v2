# Create field mappings

Learn how to navigate the Integration Hub, select SAP GL, and create field mappings between source and target fields.

After successful authentication, you can extend the default field mappings between the source and the target fields. The source fields provide a list of fields from the Zuora journal entry, journal entry item, and accounting code objects.

1.  Navigate to Marketplace > Integration Hub .
2.  Search and select SAP GL (Billing) .
3.  Click Field Mapping .
4.  Click the Edit Mappings button.
5.  Click the + icon.
6.  Choose the applicable source field and map it to the corresponding target field of the SAP journal.
7.  Click the Refresh icon to dynamically refresh the list of fields in the source and target menus upon any field changes in the Zuora or SAP journal object.
