# Management of entity and entity hierarchy

Learn to manage multi-entity hierarchies and the scope of entity operations in Zuora.

When Multi-entity is enabled for a tenant, a multi-entity hierarchy is automatically created with only a provisioned global entity. You can manage the multi-entity hierarchy to add, provision, edit, or remove entities through the Zuora UI and REST API.

The following operations are supported to manage the entities and multi-entity hierarchy from the Zuora UI and REST API:

-   [Add entities to a multi-entity hierarchy](/zuora-platform/user-management/multi-entity/multi-entity-hierarchy-management/management-of-entity-and-entity-hierarchy/add-an-entity-to-an-entity-hierarchy)

-   [Provision entities](/zuora-platform/user-management/multi-entity/multi-entity-hierarchy-management/management-of-entity-and-entity-hierarchy/provision-an-entity-in-a-entity-hierarchy)

-   [Edit certain information of entities](/zuora-platform/user-management/multi-entity/multi-entity-hierarchy-management/management-of-entity-and-entity-hierarchy/edit-the-global-entity-information-from-zuora-ui)

-   [Remove unprovisioned entities](/zuora-platform/user-management/multi-entity/multi-entity-hierarchy-management/management-of-entity-and-entity-hierarchy/edit-the-global-entity-information-from-zuora-ui)

-   [View Multi-entity Hierarchy](/zuora-platform/user-management/multi-entity/multi-entity-hierarchy-management/management-of-entity-and-entity-hierarchy/remove-an-entity-from-the-entity-hierarchy) (UI only)

-   [Retrieve entities](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/older-api/operation/GET_Entities/) (REST API only)

-   [Retrieve an entity by entity Id](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/older-api/operation/GET_EntityById/) (REST API only)


Zuora does not allow you to do the following operations:

-   Create a new entity hierarchy

-   Remove an existing multi-entity hierarchy

-   Change the parent entity of an entity

-   Restructure the multi-entity hierarchy

-   Remove a provisioned entity
