# Activate users with activation emails

Learn how to activate new users through activation emails in OneID.

To activate a new user using activation email:

1.  When the administrator creates a new user in OneID, the new user will receive an activation email in the working email.
2.  Click the activation link in the email or copy and paste the link in the browser.
3.  Reset the password and activate the user account.

If the activation is successful, that user gains access to the OneID portal (one.zuora.com ).

Note: With your OneID user account, you can now exclusively

create API

or service accounts in the user management module of the Billing application. To create a new business user account, navigate to the

Users

module in OneID.
