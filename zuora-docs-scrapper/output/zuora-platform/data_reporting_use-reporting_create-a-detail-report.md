# Create a detail report

Learn how to create a detail report

Create your own Reporting detail reports according to your specifications.

## Create a detail report

To create a new detail report, start from the Reporting page and click Create New Report.

The Reporting wizard walks you through the steps to creating a new report. At a very high level there's just three steps:

1.  Select the data source.
2.  Build and preview the report.
3.  Save, run and view the report.

After selecting the data source the drag and drop report builder interface enables quick creation of customized reports.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to detail reports.

-   The time for running a detail report is limited to 1 hour. If the running time exceeds 1 hour, the process will be stopped.

-   Report names must be unique. Unless otherwise renamed by a user, the name of newly created reports will default to "Untitled Report - YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SSZ", where YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SSZ corresponds to the date and time (in UTC) that the report was saved.


## What is next

For more information on creating filters for your detail report see: [Filters](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/use-reporting/create-a-summary-report/filters).

See [Folders and sharing](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/use-reporting/folders-and-sharing) for more information on saving and sharing reports to either private or shared folders.
