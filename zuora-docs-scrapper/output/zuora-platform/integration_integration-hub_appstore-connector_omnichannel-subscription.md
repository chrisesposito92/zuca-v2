# Omnichannel subscription

This document outlines the omnichannel subscription feature, currently in the EA phase, and provides a detailed mapping of Zuora subscription fields with Apple App Store notifications.

Note:

This feature is currently in the EA phase. We are seeking feedback from a select group of users before making it available to all customers. If you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please contact Zuora Product Management .

## Connector processing logic and field mapping

This table provides a detailed mapping of Zuora subscription fields with values derived from Apple App Store notifications for both V1 and V2 payloads. It serves as a reference guide for configuring Zuora’s subscription object fields based on data received from the Apple App Store server. Key attributes such as identifiers, subscription statuses, and renewal details are defined, along with the conditions and values for each field based on the version of the payload.
