# Field Mapping of Account and Related Objects

This article shows how the Zuora account and related objects and their fields are mapped and synchronized to Salesforce objects and fields in Zuora Connector for Salesforce CRM. Each sync objects pair is marked as <Zuora object> : <Salesforce object>.

Note:

Any Zuora field marked as "internal" is a field that is not exposed in the Zuora SOAP API. However, these internal fields are synchronized between Zuora and Salesforce in Zuora Connector for Salesforce CRM.

The descriptions of the "internal" sync fields are provided in this article. For the descriptions of the standard fields, see SOAP API Object Reference for more information.
