# Create custom object reports

Learn how to create custom object reports

Zuora [Custom Objects](/zuora-platform/extensibility/custom-objects/custom-objects-overview) extends Zuora business object models and allows you to define your own data structures to meet your business requirements. This article explains how to create reports by using the data in custom objects.

You can create a report for custom objects in the following ways:

-   [Create a report with a custom object data source](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/use-reporting/create-custom-object-reports/create-a-report-with-a-custom-object-data-source)

-   [Create a report from saved data queries that use custom objects](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/use-reporting/create-custom-object-reports/create-a-report-from-saved-data-queries-that-use-custom-objects)

    -   [Create a report from the saved query](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/use-reporting/create-custom-object-reports/create-a-report-from-the-saved-query)


The fields that can be used in reports vary depending on the way you choose. Detailed information about which fields you can use in each way is provided in the sub sections of this article.
