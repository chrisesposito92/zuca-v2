# Debit Memo Field Mappings: Zuora to NetSuite Sync (Invoice Settlement Enabled)

Note:

This feature is currently in development and is subject to change without advance notice. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters.

This reference describes the mappings of the Debit Memo sync from Zuora to NetSuite. Note that the Debit Memo sync is supported only if Invoice Settlement is enabled for your Zuora tenant.

In some cases, the Source and Destination fields are associated with different objects.
