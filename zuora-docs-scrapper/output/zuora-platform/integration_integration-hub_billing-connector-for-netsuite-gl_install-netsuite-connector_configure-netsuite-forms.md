# Configure NetSuite forms

Learn about NetSuite forms

## Overview

Zuora forms included in the NetSuite integration bundle include all of the fields required for the sync. If you want to use existing custom forms, you must make sure that the following fields are displayed on your preferred form.

These lists include standard and custom fields, by NetSuite Object, that must be set to be displayed on the preferred custom forms that you want to use.

## Field requirements and availability

These fields are required, except where noted otherwise.

Some fields are not available in certain NetSuite editions or require that you enable additional NetSuite features, and some fields are only required with certain Integrations Manager configurations:
