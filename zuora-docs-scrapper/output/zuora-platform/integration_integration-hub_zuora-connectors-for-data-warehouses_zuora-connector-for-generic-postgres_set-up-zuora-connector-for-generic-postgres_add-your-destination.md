1.  After completing the initial setup, access the Generic Postgres connector setup UI to start the provisioning process. To do this, you will need access to the [Integration Hub](/zuora-platform/integration/integration-hub/get-started-with-integration-hub).
2.  Follow this article to link your Connect account to your Zuora account and install the app. If you face any issues, raise a support ticket and stay in touch with your account representative for the necessary access to the Integration Hub UI.
3.  Once you have access, go to the Marketplace menu and select Integration Hub UI.
4.  Search for Zuora Connector for Generic Postgres and select it.
5.  You will see three tabs: Overview, Setup, and Status.
6.  In the Setup tab, click Configure, enter the required details, and select objects for synchronization.
7.  Click Test Connection. If successful, click to finalize the setup. This will initiate the onboarding process.
8.  After onboarding, the connector's Status will change to Active, and you will see status data in the Status tab after the first successful transfer.
9.  Alternatively, If you encounter issues gaining access to this UI, share your Generic Postgres host address with a Zuora representative. They will assist in creating a connection link. Use the provided connection link to securely input your Generic Postgres details, including the port, database name, schema, and authentication credentials information to complete the setup.
