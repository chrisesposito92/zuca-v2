# View the data query history

Learn how to view the data query history.

You can view the data queries submitted in history through Data Query UI. If you are an administrator, you can view all the data queries submitted in history. Otherwise, you can only view the data queries that you submit in history.

1.  Navigate to Extension Studio > Data Query .
2.  Click the HISTORY tab on the Data Query page. The last 1000 submitted data queries will be returned. You can find details of each query history in the table, such as the query expression, source, status, returned rows, compression status, warehouse size (applies only to Zuora Warehouse), and other information.

    You can make the following operations upon a data query in history:

    -   Download the query result by clicking the download icon if the query job is completed.

    -   Cancel the query by clicking the cancel icon if the query job is in the submitted or in progress status.

    -   Create a new data query by clicking the more icon and then clicking Create as New Data Query.
