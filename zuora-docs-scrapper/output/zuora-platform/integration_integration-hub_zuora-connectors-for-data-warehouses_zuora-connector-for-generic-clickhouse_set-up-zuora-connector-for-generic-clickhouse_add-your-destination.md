# Add your destination

Add your destination

1.  After completing the initial setup, access the Generic ClickHouse connector setup UI to start the provisioning process. To do this, you will need access to the [Integration Hub](/zuora-platform/integration/integration-hub/get-started-with-integration-hub).
2.  Follow this article to link your Connect account to your Zuora account and install the app. For any assistance, raise a support ticket and stay in touch with your account representative for the necessary access to the Integration Hub UI.
3.  Once you have access, navigate to the Marketplace >Integration Hub UI.
4.  Search and select Zuora Connector for Generic ClickHouse.
5.  Click the Setup tab, click Configure, enter the required details, and select objects for synchronization.
6.  Click Test Connection. If successful, click Save Destination to finalize the setup. This will initiate the onboarding process.
7.  After onboarding, the connector's Status will change to Active, and you will see status data in the Status tab after the first successful transfer.
8.  Alternatively, If you encounter issues gaining access to this UI, share your ClickHouse host address with a Zuora representative. They will assist in creating a connection link. Use the provided connection link to securely input your ClickHouse database details, including the Bucket vendor, Bucket name, Bucket region, port, cluster, etc. and staging bucket information to complete the setup.
