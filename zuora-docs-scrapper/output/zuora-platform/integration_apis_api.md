# API

Overview of the Zuora API.

New Zuora functionalities are only available using our [REST API](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/overview/).

Zuora's SOAP API continues to be maintained as part of our commitment to our earliest customers, but new API development must use the REST API.
