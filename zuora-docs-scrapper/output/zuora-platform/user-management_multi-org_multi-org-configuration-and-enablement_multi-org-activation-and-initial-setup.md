# Multi-Org activation and initial setup

Learn how to activate Zuora Multi-Org for new or existing tenants.

To get started with Multi-Org, the first step is to activate Zuora Multi-Org for your new tenant or an existing one.

## Activate Zuora Multi-Org for a new tenant

You must contact [Zuora Global Support](https://www.zuora.com/support-center/) and provide the details of your first super admin user to manage the Multi-Org setup. Our team will enable Multi-Org for you in the Zuora Central Sandbox tenant and create your organization's first Multi-Org super admin user account.

Initially, this will be the only Multi-Org super admin user account available under your organization in the central Sandbox tenant.

To create your organization's first Org Super Admin, provide the following details of the user account:

-   User name
-   User work email address
-   Login name

On successful account creation of the Super Admin account, the user will receive an activation email to the address provided above with the link to the Sandbox tenant.

After successfully logging into the SBX tenant, the Org Super Admin can perform the following operations:

-   Create the Org hierarchy for your company
-   Add users to different org units based on the org hierarchy created

## Activate Zuora Multi-Org for an existing tenant

For more information, refer to the [Single Tenant upgrade scenario](/zuora-platform/user-management/multi-org/multi-org-configuration-and-enablement/multi-org-upgrade-models/upgrade-single-tenant-to-zuora-multi-org) for more details.

## Access to your SBX

Access your SBX using the activation email sent to you either by Zuora Support or the one initiated by your own Super Admin.

By default, you will be logged into the Org Unit that you have been granted access to. This may be at the branch level (for example, Central Europe in the Org Hierarchy depicted in the previous example) or the leaf Org Unit France. If you are a user at the branch level, then you will have a context switch to move between the parts of the Org Hierarchy that you have been assigned to and perform operations within the scope of the Org hierarchy.
