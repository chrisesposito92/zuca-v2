# Currency conversion

Information on using foreign currency conversion data

To include foreign currency conversion data in data source exports, you must enable Automatically include additional Currency Conversion information in data source exports on the Manage Currency Conversion settings page. See [Configure Foreign Currency Conversion](/accounts-receivable/finance/zuora-finance-settings/currency-conversion-management/foreign-currency-conversion/configure-foreign-currency-conversion) for more information.

See [Foreign Currency Conversion for Data Source Exports](/accounts-receivable/finance/zuora-finance-settings/currency-conversion-management/foreign-currency-conversion-for-data-source-exports) for a description of the data source fields that provide foreign currency conversion data.

You can include foreign currency conversion data in Zuora Reporting by creating reports from saved data queries using the `fx_convert` function. For more information, see [Query data with ad hoc foreign currency conversion](/zuora-platform/data/reporting/use-reporting/create-a-report-from-saved-data-queries#concept-wdwlw9f3__title-21200).
