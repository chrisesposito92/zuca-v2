## Types of system status

Operational : The system or application is working as expected. All services are operational, and there are no known performance or accessibility issues.

Degraded Performance : There are problems affecting the performance of the system or application. As users, you could face slower response times, intermittent connectivity problems, or other performance-related issues. The service is currently accessible but not performing at its best.

Maintenance : The system or application is undergoing scheduled maintenance. During this time, updates and improvements will be applied, which may result in temporary unavailability or reduced functionality for you. Maintenance periods are usually scheduled and notified ahead of time.

## Response time

The response time provides a detailed analysis of how quickly systems and applications respond, demonstrating their performance and responsiveness within a specific timeframe including Day, Week or Month. The graphs are crucial for identifying patterns, anomalies, and possible performance problems. Response time spikes indicate high load or potential issues that need investigation. It is crucial to regularly monitor these visuals to maintain system efficiency and handle user requests promptly.

The response times here are the average response times for the environment your tenants are in. For detailed response times specific to your tenant, you can view System Health within your tenant. See Zuora System Health .

## Trust subscribers

Admins can monitor the users in their organization who are subscribed to Trust updates.

Note:

For OneID users: On adding or deleting a tenant, you will start or stop receiving specific system status updates for that tenant within 24-hours from the time the tenant was added/deleted.
