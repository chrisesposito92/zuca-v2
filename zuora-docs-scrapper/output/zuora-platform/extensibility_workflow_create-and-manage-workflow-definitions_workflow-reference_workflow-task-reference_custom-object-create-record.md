# Custom Object: Create Record

This reference explains the Custom Object: Create Record task.

This task creates a record of an existing custom object definition. You can create a custom object definition using the custom object APIs or from the Zuora Data Model UI.

When creating the task, you need to select a custom object definition from the list and specify values for the data fields of the object.

If you have created a custom object definition or a field definition of a custom object but it is not displayed in the drop-down list, refresh the Workflow cache. To learn about how to refresh the cache of Workflow, see [Workflow maintenance settings](/zuora-platform/extensibility/workflow/configure-global-settings-of-workflow/workflow-maintenance-settings).

To learn more about custom object definitions and records, see [custom object definitions](/zuora-platform/extensibility/custom-objects/custom-object-definition-management/create-a-new-custom-object-definition) and [custom object records](/zuora-platform/extensibility/custom-objects/custom-object-record-management/create-a-new-custom-object-record).
