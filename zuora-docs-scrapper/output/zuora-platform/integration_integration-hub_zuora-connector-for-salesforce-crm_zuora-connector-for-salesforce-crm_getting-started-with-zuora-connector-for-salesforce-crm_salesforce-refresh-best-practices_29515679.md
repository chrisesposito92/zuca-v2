# Create Quotes with synced products

Ensure accurate and error-free Quotes by using synchronized product catalog data from Zuora, facilitating seamless integration with Salesforce.

Use the synchronized product catalog data from the Zuora tenant to ensure the creation of accurate and error-free Quotes. This step eliminates discrepancies and ensures seamless integration between your Salesforce org and Zuora tenant.
