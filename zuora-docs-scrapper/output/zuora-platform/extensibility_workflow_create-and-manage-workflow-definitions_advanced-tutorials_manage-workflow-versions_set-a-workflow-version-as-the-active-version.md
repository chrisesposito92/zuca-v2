# Set a workflow version as the active version

Learn how to set an inactive workflow version as the active version.

When you complete updates and test on an inactive version, you can activate it so that it can be run with event triggers or on schedule as the current version. For details about the active and inactive versions, see [Workflow versioning overview](/zuora-platform/extensibility/workflow/create-and-manage-workflow-definitions/advanced-tutorials/manage-workflow-versions/workflow-versioning-overview).

1.  Open a workflow.
2.  Click the Versions tab.
3.  Click the menu icon next to the workflow version that you need to set to Active and then click Set Active .
