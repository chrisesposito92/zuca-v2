# View active usage and entitlement details

Learn how to view and expand active usage and entitlement details on the Entitlements Dashboard.

The Entitlements Dashboard displays the entitled item’s period, total usage and entitlement data. The total usage column offers administrators a comprehensive look at entitlements that report usage data.

Access the following data on the Entitlements dashboard:

-   Billing Volume Usage

-   Number of Subscribers

-   Revenue Volume Usage

-   Custom Objects

-   Workflow

-   Payment Gateways

-   APISandbox

-   Central Sandbox

-   Developer Sandbox


Dashboard components, such as payment gateways, workflow, and custom objects, can be expanded by hovering and clicking on them. For example, expanding workflows will reveal workflow entitlement dates, purchased editions, and add-ons. Total usage indicates the use distribution across multiple tenants.

To view an entitled item in detail:

1.  Click the side arrow icon from an entitled item.
2.  Click the data card to expand and view the components of the entitled item. Optionally, you can click down and side arrows to cycle through the expanded version of the dashboard’s components.

    Note:

    To disable the Entitlements feature in the Command Center, submit a [support ticket.](https://support.zuora.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=119878) Once disabled, administrators will no longer have access to Entitlements data.
