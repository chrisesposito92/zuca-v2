# Overview of Zuora Connector for AWS S3

Zuora Connector for AWS S3 enables your organization to directly access your Zuora data through AWS S3.

Note:

The Zuora Connector for Data Warehouses feature is in the Early availability phase. This is a paid add-on. If you are interested in joining our early availability program, please reach out to your Zuora Representative for further details.

This integration involves a one-time setup process, eliminating the technical challenges otherwise associated with managing data extracts, integrations, and schema updates. Once configured, your data is automatically updated daily within AWS S3, providing your teams with instant access to comprehensive subscription operational and analytical data from Zuora Billing.

This ready access empowers your teams to make prompt, informed decisions based on valuable insights.

## How the Zuora Connector for AWS S3 works

Once configured, the connector ensures the automated synchronization of your Zuora data into your designated S3 bucket on a daily basis.

This connector is specifically tailored to integrate seamlessly with AWS S3, enhancing your data storage and analytics capabilities within your existing AWS infrastructure.
