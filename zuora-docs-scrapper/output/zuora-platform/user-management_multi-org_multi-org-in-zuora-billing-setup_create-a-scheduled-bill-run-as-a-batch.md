# Create a scheduled bill run as a batch

Learn how to create a scheduled bill run by navigating to the Billing section, selecting account types, and specifying bill run information.

1.  Navigate to Billing > Bill Runs.
2.  Click New Scheduled Bill Run and complete the following steps:
3.  Select either Multiple Accounts or Single Account. You should keep the following points in mind while selecting the customer accounts for a Multi-Org business:
    1.  If you select Multiple Accounts , the customer accounts visible to you will only be those belonging to the org unit you belong to.
    2.  If you select Single Account , the list of customer accounts visible to you for selection will be those belonging to the same org unit that you have access to. i.e. The list of customer accounts displayed for the Single customer account bill run will be filtered by the org unit name in the company field.
4.  Specify the Bill run information mentioned in Steps 2 - 7 in [Create a scheduled bill run](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/bill-runs/automate-billing-document-generation/bill-runs-creation/create-a-scheduled-bill-run) to start the scheduled bill run.
