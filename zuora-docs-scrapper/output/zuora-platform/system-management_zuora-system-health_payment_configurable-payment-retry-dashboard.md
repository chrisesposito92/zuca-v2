# Configurable Payment Retry dashboard

A dashboard that helps you view at-a-glance real-time status/health of collection actions specific to payment retry logic

Configurable Payment Retry (CPR) Dashboard helps you view at-a-glance real-time status/health of collection actions specific to payment retry logic. The configurable Payment Retry dashboard is under the Administration > System Health section in the left navigation menu.

The CPR dashboard is automatically populated with data when Configurable Payment Retry is enabled to perform various retry strategies to improve your collections. For more information, see [Configurable Payment RetryNo Content found for /db/organizations/zuora/repositories/prod-sitemap/content/documents/external\_publications/payments/Configurable\_Payment\_Retry/Topics/Overview.dita](/db/organizations/zuora/repositories/prod-sitemap/content/documents/external_publications/payments/Configurable_Payment_Retry/Topics/Overview.dita). The CPR Dashboard does not require any additional setup or access.
