# Set Up Two-Factor Authentication as a User

Learn how to set up two-factor authentication using SMS or an authentication application, and understand when re-authentication is required.

Users have the option of receiving the authentication code in two ways:

-   SMS authentication
-   Authentication application

The following cases require re-authentication:

-   Logging in to Zuora One ID after the Remember me for 30 days period has expired.
-   Logging in from another machine or browser where the Remember me for 30 days option has not been enabled.
