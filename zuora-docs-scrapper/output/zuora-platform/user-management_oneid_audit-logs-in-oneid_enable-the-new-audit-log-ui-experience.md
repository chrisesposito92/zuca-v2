# Enable the new Audit log UI experience

Zuora's new Audit Trail UI and UX enhance usability and data visibility, allowing users to toggle between classic and new interfaces.

To improve usability and streamline data visibility, Zuora has introduced a new Audit Trail user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). Because this update introduces significant changes, a self-service enablement feature allows customers to toggle between the classic and new UI.

1.  In OneID, navigate to Admin Console > Audit Logs.
2.  Enable the New Audit Trail experience toggle to view the new UI design.
3.  Here's what you can expect in the new UI:
    1.  Filtering based on the Event Type: Using this option, you can filter the event type based on the following categories:

        -   OneID Log-In Activity

        -   OneID Admin & Settings Changes

        -   Billing Tenant Log-In Activity - Select the Billing Tenant from the Tenant ID drop-down list and click Apply Filter.

        -   Billing Tenant Configuration Changes - Select the Billing Tenant from the Tenant ID drop-down list and click Apply Filter.

        -   Billing Tenant Object Change Event - Select the Billing Tenant from the Tenant ID drop-down list and click Apply Filter.
