# Users in OneID

Explore the roles and capabilities of different user types in OneID, including organization admins, standard users, and Zuora support users.

A OneID user refers to a user account in OneID. A user represents a person with a specific identity (for example, administrator, developer, and operator) in your organization

There are two user types in OneID:

-   Organization Admin

-   Standard User


## Organization admins

Organization admins have access to the OneID Admin Console, where they can create or edit users, user roles, and user groups for your organization. In addition, organization admins can perform any actions that standard users can do, such as link tenant users, and access Zuora tenants with OneID.

The capabilities of an organization admin are as follows:

-   Add users to OneID

-   Manage users in OneID

-   Manage user roles in OneID

-   Manage user groups in OneID

-   Access Zuora tenants with OneID

    -   View Zuora tenants in OneID

    -   Manage your user profile in OneID

-   Configure OneID settings

-   Configure single sign-on for OneID


## Standard users

Standard users use OneID as a single entry point to access Zuora tenants.

The capabilities of a standard user are as follows:

-   Access Zuora tenants with OneID

-   Manage your user profile in OneID


## Zuora support users

The Zuora support account is a default user account automatically created within your OneID organisation account. This account is exclusively created to handle support inquiries within your OneID organization and does not have any access to your Zuora tenants. From the details page, you can review the access permissions of this support account just like any other business user account.

The Zuora support account troubleshoots any issues or processes in OneID. You have the option to track and review the actions performed by the Zuora support account using the OneID Audit Trail . The audit logs keep a record of actions like logging in and making administrative changes to users and roles within your organization.
