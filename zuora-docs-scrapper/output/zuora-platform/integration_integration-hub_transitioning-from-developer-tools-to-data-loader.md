# Transitioning from Developer Tools to Data Loader

Learn how to transition from Developer Tools to Data Loader to maintain your existing use cases.

Developer Tools is approaching the end of life. Zuora recommends that you transition to Data Loader to maintain your existing use cases. The following information is intended to guide customers currently using Developer Tools to transition to Data Loader.

To learn more about Data Loader and Data Loader templates to help with your transition, see To begin your transition, See, [Data Loader overview](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zuora-platform/data-management/data-loader/data-loader-overview).

Developer Tools includes several micro-applications (Generic API Loader, Billing Preview, Product Catalog Loader, and others) that have been used for data import, export, and management tasks. These tools are being retired as part of Zuora's ongoing platform modernization.

Data Loader provides a centralized, self-service interface for importing and managing data with several improvements over Developer Tools:

The Zuora Data Loader provides three key enhancements over Developer Tools:

-   Real-time validations: Errors are detected early by validating data against tenant configurations, preventing bad data from entering your system.
-   Simplified, intuitive user experience: Automated field mapping and inline exception editing streamline corrections and ensure data accuracy from the start.
-   Self-service capability: Designed for business users, allowing teams to manage data imports and updates without relying heavily on technical resources.
