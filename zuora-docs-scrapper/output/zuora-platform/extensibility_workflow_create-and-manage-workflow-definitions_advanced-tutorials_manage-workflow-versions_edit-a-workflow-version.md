# Edit a workflow version

High-level steps to edit a workflow version.

The active version of a workflow definition is not editable. To edit a workflow version, you must first set the workflow version status to Inactive and re-activate it after editing is complete. For information about how to edit a workflow version, see [Edit a workflow](/zuora-platform/extensibility/workflow/create-and-manage-workflow-definitions/get-started-with-workflow/edit-a-workflow).

Note: You can still view the details of the tasks by clicking the pencil icon on each task.

Alternatively, you can also create a new development version of the workflow and mark active once changes are complete. See [Create a workflow version](/zuora-platform/extensibility/workflow/create-and-manage-workflow-definitions/advanced-tutorials/manage-workflow-versions/create-a-workflow-version) for details.
