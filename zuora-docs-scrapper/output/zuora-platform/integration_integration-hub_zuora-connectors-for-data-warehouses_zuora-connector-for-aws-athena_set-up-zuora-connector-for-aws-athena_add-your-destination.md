# Add your destination

Add your destination

1.  After completing the initial setup, share your `bucket name`with your Zuora representative who will create a connection link for you.
2.  Using the connection link shared with you by Zuora, you can securely input your Google Cloud Storage details, including the `query results location`, `schema`, `workgroup`, `bucket name`, `bucket region`, choose auth method and input required credentials, finalizing the setup for the connection.
3.  After you fill in all the required AWS Athena details through the provided link and test the connection, saving the destination will kickstart the onboarding process and begin transferring data.
