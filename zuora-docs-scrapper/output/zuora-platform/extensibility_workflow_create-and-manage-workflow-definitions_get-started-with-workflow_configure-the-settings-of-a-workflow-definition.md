# Configure the settings of a workflow definition

Learn how to configure the settings of a specific workflow version.

You can configure workflow version-specific settings. Available settings include cleanup policy, execution priority, security, runtime settings, triggers, notifications, and input parameters. If API callout is selected as a trigger, the API endpoint and token are also displayed in the Settings tab.
