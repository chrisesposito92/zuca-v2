# Add your destination

Add your destination

1.  After completing the initial setup, share your bucket name with a Zuora representative who will create a connection link for you.
2.  Using the connection link shared with you by Zuora, you can securely input your Google Cloud Storage details, including the folder and bucket name, choose the auth method, and input the required credentials, finalizing the setup for the connection.
3.  After you fill in all the required Google Cloud Storage details through the provided link and test the connection, saving the destination will kickstart the onboarding process and begin transferring data.
