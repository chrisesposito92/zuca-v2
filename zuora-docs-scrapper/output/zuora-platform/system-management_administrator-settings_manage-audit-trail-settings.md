# Manage Audit Trail Settings

The Manage Audit Trail Settings setting allows administrators select the business objects to be audited.

Zuora Audit Trail allows administrators to select the business objects that you want to audit. Administrators can also disable auditing the objects previously selected to be audited.

To select the business objects to be audited, navigate to .

Login History and Settings are always audited if Audit Trail is enabled in your tenant.

Your administrators can select whether to audit the objects. Once you enable the audit of the above objects, you can retrieve the object change records through [Data Query](/zuora-platform/data/data-query/overview-of-data-query). See [Retrieve the business object changes](/zuora-platform/system-management/audit-trail/sample-queries-of-audit-trail) for the sample queries.
