# Access Trust updates without OneID

Learn how to access Trust updates without needing OneID by signing up for general updates and confirming your email.

To receive personalized Trust updates, your organization must be onboarded to OneID. For more detailed information, see [Activate OneID for your organization](/zuora-platform/user-management/oneid/activate-oneid-for-your-organization).

If you do not have OneID access yet, check with your IT admin to see if your organization is already onboarded.

1.  Sign up for general Trust updates. This step does not onboard you to OneID. If you already have a OneID login and try to sign up with the same username, you will receive a notification that it already exists
2.  After signing up, confirm your email address to access general Trust updates.
3.  If you initially sign up for general Trust updates and your organization later joins OneID, ask your IT Admin to submit a support ticket to add you to your organization’s OneID account.
