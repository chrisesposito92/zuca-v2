# Define target accounts

Learn how to specify associated communication profiles when creating a notification definition.

Complete [Set delivery options](/zuora-platform/extensibility/events-and-notifications/notifications/create-a-notification/set-delivery-options).

Each customer account is associated with a communication profile. When defining notifications, you must define target accounts by assigning the notification to one or more communication profiles. For more information, see [Communication profile overview](/zuora-platform/extensibility/events-and-notifications/communication-profiles/communication-profile-overview).

1.  Optional: Click Create New Communication Profile and create a new communication profile in the pop-up window. For more information, see [Create a communication profile](/zuora-platform/extensibility/events-and-notifications/communication-profiles/configure-communication-profiles/create-a-communication-profile).
2.  Select one or more communication profiles associated with the notification from the dropdown list.
3.  Click Next.
