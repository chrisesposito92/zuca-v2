# Standard events for Zuora Platform

Describes the standard events supported by Zuora Platform.

| Name | Related Event | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System Health API Concurrency | API Concurrency | On the APIs System Health dashboard, the number of concurrent API requests within a specified time range exceeds the threshold.You can customize the notification as needed with the following event parameters:Interval : the evaluation frequency of the event.Window : the time range that the concurrent API requests occurred in.API Concurrency Type : the type of concurrent API requests.Threshold Type : Number or Percentage.Threshold : the triggering number of concurrent API requests, or percentage (0 - 100) of concurrent request limit.Mute Active : a boolean field indicates whether to mute this notification for a designated duration ( Mute Hour ) after triggering it a certain number of times ( Mute Limit ).Mute Limit : the number of times Zuora will trigger this notification before muting it.Mute Hour : the duration (in hours) for which Zuora will mute this notification.For more information about concurrent request types and limits, see Concurrent request limits. |
| System Health API Failure | API Failures | On the APIs System Health dashboard, the number of failed API requests within a specified time range exceeds the threshold.You can customize the notification as needed with the following event parameters:Interval : the evaluation frequency of the event.Threshold : the triggering number or percentage (0 - 100) of failed API requests.Threshold Type : Number or Percentage.Window : the time range that the failed API requests occurred in.Endpoint : the API endpoint of the failed API requests. You can select all API endpoints or a specific one.Mute Active : a boolean field indicates whether to mute this notification for a designated duration ( Mute Hour ) after triggering it a certain number of times ( Mute Limit ).Mute Limit : the number of times Zuora will trigger this notification before muting it.Mute Hour : the duration (in hours) for which Zuora will mute this notification.For example, you can define a notification based on this event with the following values:Interval : 30Threshold : 10Threshold Type : NumberWindow : 60Endpoint : POST /v1/subscriptionsZuora evaluates the notification every 30 minutes. During the evaluation, if the number of failed subscription creation API requests over the last 60 minutes is greater than or equal to 10, this notification will be triggered.Because of the defined polling interval, some API failures might not be instantly picked up by the notification system, which can cause a temporary discrepancy between the notification record and the API System Health dashboard. The impact of such a discrepancy should be minimal, and it will be auto-rectified over time. |

Percentile (P95, P90, or P50) or mean.Endpoint : the API endpoint of the API requests. You can select all API endpoints or a specific one.Mute Active : a boolean field indicates whether to mute this notification for a designated duration ( Mute Hour ) after triggering it a certain number of times ( Mute Limit ).Mute Limit : the number of times Zuora will trigger this notification before muting it.Mute Hour : the duration (in hours) for which Zuora will mute this notification.For example, you can define a notification based on this event with the following values:Interval : 1440Threshold : 5000Window : 120Threshold Percentile : P95Endpoint : AllZuora evaluates the notification every 1440 minutes. During the evaluation, if the 95th percentile of the response time of all API requests over the last 120 minutes is greater than or equal to 5000 milliseconds, this notification will be triggered. |
