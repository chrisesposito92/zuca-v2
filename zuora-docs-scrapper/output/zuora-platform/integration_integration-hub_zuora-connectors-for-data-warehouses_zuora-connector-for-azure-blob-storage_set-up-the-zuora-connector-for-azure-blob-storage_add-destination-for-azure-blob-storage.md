# Add destination for Azure Blob Storage

Learn how to add destination for Zuora Connector for Azure Blob Storage

After completing the prerequisites, provide the Zuora tenant ID for which the Azure Blob Storage connector needs to be set up.

2.  Search for Zuora Connector for Azure Blob Storage.
3.  Open the connector. You will see three tabs: Overview, Setup, and Status.
4.  In the Setup tab, click Configure, enter your destination details, and select the objects to sync.
5.  Click Test Connection.
6.  If the test is successful, click Save Destination to trigger onboarding.
