# BillingPreviewResult

The BillingPreviewResult object provides the result of an invoice item preview for a single customer account.

As of Zuora R181, WSDL version 61.0, the feature formerly known as forecast API was renamed to Billing Preview API. Zuora recommends that you upgrade to this latest version as soon as possible. Download WSDL version 61.0+ to use the Billing Preview API. See [Zuora WSDL](/zuora-platform/integration/apis/soap-api/zuora-wsdl) for information about downloading the current version.

## Supported calls

You can use this complex type with the [billingPreview](/zuora-platform/integration/apis/soap-api/soap-api-calls/billingpreview) call.

## Walkthroughs and use cases

The BillingPreviewResult complex type provides the result of an invoice item preview for a single customer account. To use this complex type:

1.  Request an invoice item billing preview for a single customer account by using a BillingPreviewRequest complex type as the argument to a billingPreview call.

2.  Results are returned synchronously as an array of InvoiceItem objects in a BillingPreviewResult complex type.
