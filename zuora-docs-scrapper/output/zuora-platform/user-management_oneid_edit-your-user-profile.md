# Edit your user profile

Learn how to edit the basic information of your user profile in the OneID portal.

To edit the basic information of your user profile, take the following steps:

1.  Click your avatar in the upper right of the OneID portal, and click Profile . The user profile page opens.
2.  Click Edit in the Basic Information section.
3.  Update the basic information fields as needed.
4.  Click Save . You can find your user profile is updated on the user profile page.

Note: Note that as a standard user, you can edit your profile on the user profile page. However, as an organization admin, you can edit any user's profile on the Users page under Admin Console. For more information, see [Users in OneID](/zuora-platform/user-management/oneid/users-in-oneid) .
