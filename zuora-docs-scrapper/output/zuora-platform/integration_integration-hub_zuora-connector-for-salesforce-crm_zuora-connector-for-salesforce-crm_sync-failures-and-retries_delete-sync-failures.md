# Delete sync failures

Learn how to delete sync failures from the Sync Failure List page, including options to select specific records or delete all unsuccessful syncs.

To delete a sync failure:

1.  On the Sync Failure List page, select the checkboxes before the failure records you are to delete. You can quickly select all the records by selecting the checkbox in the header row.
2.  Also, you can select the records by object type using the object type filter, as shown in the following step:

    -   Select the object type from the Record Type field at the top right of the Sync Failure List page.


3.  Click Delete to delete the sync for the selected object types. The selected records will be deleted from Zuora and removed from the OBJECTS TO RETRY page.
4.  Optional - Click Delete All to delete all the unsuccessful synced records.
