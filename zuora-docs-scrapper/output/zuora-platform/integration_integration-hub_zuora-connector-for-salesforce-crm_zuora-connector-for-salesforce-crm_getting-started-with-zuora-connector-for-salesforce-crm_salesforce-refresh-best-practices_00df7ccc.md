# Sync product catalog from Zuora tenant

Ensure your Salesforce org is aligned with the latest product offerings by syncing the product catalog from the Zuora tenant.

Since the refreshed Salesforce org now interacts with the live Zuora production tenant, existing Quotes in Salesforce may encounter errors due to differences in the product catalog. To mitigate this, perform a Product Catalog sync from the Zuora tenant to ensure your Salesforce org is aligned with the latest product offerings. To do this, take the following steps:

1.  First, select your username located in the upper right corner, then proceed to the Commerce section.
2.  On the following screen that appears, find the option labeled Synchronize Salesforce.com Data and click on it.
3.  Within the Manual Sync section, choose Product Catalog and then click the Clean Up button.
