# Prepaid Drawdown

The Prepaid Drawdown app facilitates upfront payments and balance consumption for products or services, integrating seamlessly with the Zuora billing system.

## Prepaid Drawdown Overview

With the Prepaid Drawdown app, you can offer a prepaid and drawdown model for your products or services to customers. This enables you to collect payments upfront and allows customers to consume against that balance. With its deep integration to the Zuora billing system, the app offers a quick and easy solution for your prepayment use cases.

## Features

-   Specify prepayment charges, which tops up a prepaid balance by a specified amount.

-   Apply drawdown charges against a prepaid balance using any combination of one time, recurring, and usage charges.

-   Hold a balance at the customer's account or subscription level.

-   Provide options to customers when the prepaid balance is insufficient to pay an invoice.

-   Offer promotional “free” prepayment amounts to prospective accounts. This can also be linked to the Promotion Code app to apply a prepaid balance when a personalized promotion code is used.
