# Manage Technical Support Dashboard

The Technical Support Dashboard offers a comprehensive view of support activities, including ticket statuses, data summaries, and real-time updates, accessible via Zuora OneID.

The Support dashboard is designed to provide you with a comprehensive view of your support activities. It includes charts, data summaries, ticket status, active and solved ticket counts, data filters, and a real-time update feature showcasing the most recent five tickets.

To view the Support dashboard, navigate to Support in Zuora OneID.

Note:

If you're a first-time user of Command Center, you must authorize access to Zendesk to view and manage the tickets on the homepage. For subsequent logins, no authorization is required.
