# Create a solution instance for Revenue connector for NetSuite

Learn how to create a solution instance to select and contain the objects from NetSuite that need to be ingested into Revenue whenever connector is executed.

-   Solution instances allow you to include different business-critical objects to be pushed from NetSuite to Revenue, such Orders, Invoices, Credit Memos, and custom objects.

-   The connector provides you the flexibility to choose one or more objects and any combination of objects to be pushed from NetSuite and ingest them into Revenue.

-   Supports incremental data ingestion.


1.  From the Solutions Instances tab, click the add icon to create a solution instance.
2.  Enter the name for the solution instance.
3.  Select the list of objects to be grouped or packaged into the solution instance, and then toggle the flag.
4.  To undo the changes you made, click Cancel, or save your entries.
5.  Repeat to create additional solution instances.

You can edit existing solutions instances, including toggle the object on or off, or change the value in the ERP or Revenue object names.
