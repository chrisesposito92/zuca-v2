# Settings API field name and UI text comparison table

Provides comparison tables between field names in the Settings API and their corresponding texts in the Zuora UI.

For some Settings API field names, it is not very easy to identify their corresponding texts as displayed in the Zuora UI. The comparison tables in this section provide such mapping details that might help when you configure subscription and order settings, billing rules, payment rules, and accounting rules through API.
