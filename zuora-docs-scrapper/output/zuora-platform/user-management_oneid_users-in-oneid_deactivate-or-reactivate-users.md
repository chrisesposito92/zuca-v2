# Deactivate or reactivate users

Learn how to deactivate or reactivate users in OneID to control their access.

A deactivated user cannot log in to OneID, regardless through the OneID portal or an identity provider via single sign-on, until the user account is reactivated in OneID by organization admins.

To deactivate or reactivate a user in OneID, take the following steps:

1.  Navigate to Admin Console > Users .
2.  Click the First Name or Last Name of a user. The detailed page of this user opens.
3.  Click Deactivate User or Reactivate User . The confirmation dialog opens.
4.  Click Confirm in the dialog. Then you can find the status of this user changes to `INACTIVE` or `ACTIVE` on the detailed page.
