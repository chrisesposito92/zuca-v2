# Initiate a dry run

Learn how to initiate a dry run to verify your settings and field mappings before transferring to the accounting operation.

Before attempting your first transfer to the accounting operation, you can initiate a dry run to verify if your settings and field mappings are configured as required. This process executes the field mappings and generates output for any journal entries for any journal runs awaiting transfer to accounting. This operation can result in more than one dry run job.

1.  Navigate to Marketplace > Integration Hub .
2.  Search and select the SAP GL (Billing).
3.  Click Field Mapping .
4.  Click the Initiate a Dry Run button.
5.  Click the Jobs tab.
6.  Click the View button for the Dry Run job, or jobs, you have created.
