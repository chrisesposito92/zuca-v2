# Working with SOAP

The advantage of using SOAP is that it is an industry standard, works with XML which is easily read by both humans and computer, and almost all programming frameworks have built-in libraries that make using SOAP simple.

## Use the SOAP XML

Zuora recommends that when you are working and debugging your applications using the SOAP API, inspect and use the SOAP (XML) to identify what is happening in your code. Inconsistencies or subtleties can be overlooked when programming, but working with XML allows for more precise error checking.
