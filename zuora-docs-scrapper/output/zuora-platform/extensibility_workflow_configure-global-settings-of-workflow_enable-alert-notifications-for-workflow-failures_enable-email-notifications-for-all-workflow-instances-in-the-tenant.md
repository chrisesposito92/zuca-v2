# Enable email notifications for all workflow instances in the tenant

Learn how to enable email notifications for all workflows instances.

1.  On the Workflow landing page, click Settings to open the global settings page.
2.  In the Global Settings section, enter the email addresses for receiving notifications in the Notification Recipients field and enter the email return path.

    Note: By default, the notifications are sent to the active users of your Workflow tenant in the last 30 days. You can remove this default setting and instead identify one or more email addresses for receiving notifications. If any of the email recipients in the current recipient's list are no longer with the company, you must manually update the notification settings to remove the former employees' email addresses.

3.  Click Update Settings to save the update.
