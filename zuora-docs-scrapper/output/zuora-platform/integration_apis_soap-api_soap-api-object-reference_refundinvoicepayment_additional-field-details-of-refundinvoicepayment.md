# Additional field details of RefundInvoicePayment

Additional details of the fields of the RefundInvoicePayment object.

## Id

The ID of this object. Every object has a unique identifier that Zuora automatically assigns upon creation. You use this ID later when you work with the object. For example, if you send an `amend()` call to modify an existing subscription, then you need to include the specific `Subscription` object's ID with the call.

The ID for the `RefundInvoicePayment` object is `RefundInvoicePaymentId` .

## RefundAmount

Specifies the amount of refund that applies against a the InvoicePayment. This read-only field is generated by the system, and exists only when a payment that was applied to an invoice is later refunded.

For example: An invoice is generated for $1000. An $800 payment is applied, then $300 of that payment is refunded. In this example, the amount of the invoice ( `Invoice.Amount` ) is $1000, the balance ( `Invoice.Balance` ) is $500 (= $1000-$800+$300), the refund amount ( `Invoice.RefundAmount` ) is $300, and the payment amount ( `Invoice.PaymentAmount` ) is $800.
