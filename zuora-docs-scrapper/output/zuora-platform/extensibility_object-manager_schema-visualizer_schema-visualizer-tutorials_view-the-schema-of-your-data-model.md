# View the schema of your data model

Learn how to view the schema of your data model via the Schema Visualizer.

1.  Navigate to in the left navigation menu.
2.  On the Object Manager page, click the Schema Visualizer tab. A canvas with Zuora Billing objects opens.
3.  Enable all product filters by clicking the product names in the upper left of the page. Only Billing is enabled by default.
4.  Switch the Show Fields toggle to display standard and custom field information for all objects.

All standard and custom objects with field information are displayed on the canvas.

Note that only objects you have access to are displayed. For example, you cannot find the Payment Schedule or Payment Schedule Item object if you do not have the Payment Schedule feature enabled.
