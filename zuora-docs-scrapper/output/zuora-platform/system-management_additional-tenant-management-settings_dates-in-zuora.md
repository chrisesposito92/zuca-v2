# Dates in Zuora

Dates are an important part of your billing and payments operations, and control which charges are billed and when they are processed for payment.

For example, Subscription Dates determine when your charges are ready to be billed. When the charges are actually billed depends on your Bill Cycle Day and other date attributes. This guide describes the dates in subscriptions and amendments and the date attributes in the product catalog rate plan charge and customer accounts.
