# Grant user access to other entities

Learn how entity administrators can manage user access to other entities.

Only the entity administrators have permission to manage user accesses. You need to finish the following steps to grant an entity user access to other entities:

1.  [Send an access request to the entity that the user wants to access](/zuora-platform/user-management/multi-entity/multi-entity-user-management/user-access-within-multi-entity-hierarchy/grant-user-access-to-other-entities/send-a-user-access-request).
2.  [Accept the access request.](/zuora-platform/user-management/multi-entity/multi-entity-user-management/user-access-within-multi-entity-hierarchy/grant-user-access-to-other-entities/accept-the-user-access-request) If the entity administrator who sends the access request is also the administrator of the entity that the user wants to access, the access request will be automatically accepted. In such cases, you do not need to perform this step. For example, a user of the Europe entity wants to access the UK entity. An administrator of the Europe entity sends a user access request to the UK entity. If this administrator is also given access to the UK entity and assigned as the UK entity administrator, the access request is automatically accepted in the UK entity.
