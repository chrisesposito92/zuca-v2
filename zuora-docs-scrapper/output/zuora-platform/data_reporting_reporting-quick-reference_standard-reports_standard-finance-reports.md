# Standard Finance reports

This reference lists the outcomes of Standard Finance reports.

Standard Reports for Finance are in the Early Adopter phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it to all customers. To join this early adopter program, submit a request to [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/).

Note:

-   AR Aging reports are only available for past accounting periods; they are not available for current or future accounting periods.
-   This feature is only available if you have Invoice Settlement enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memos, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to have access to the feature, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-settlement/get-started-with-invoice-settlement/invoice-settlement-migration-checklist-and-guide) for more information.
