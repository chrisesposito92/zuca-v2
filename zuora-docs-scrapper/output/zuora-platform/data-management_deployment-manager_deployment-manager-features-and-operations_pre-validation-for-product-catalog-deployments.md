# Pre-validation for product catalog deployments

Learn how to use Pre-validation in Deployment Manager to verify deployments, identify missing dependencies, and ensure smoother deployments.

Pre-validation in Deployment Manager allows you to verify deployments before applying changes to the target tenant.

This early feedback mechanism helps you identify missing dependencies upfront, ensuring smoother deployments. By detecting errors early, Pre-Validation saves time, reduces deployment failures.

Note: Verify and Deploy is available for Product Catalog and Notifications only.

1.  Once Deployment Manager has finished preparing the compare results, click View Details on the relevant deployment card.
2.  On the Compare screen, select the components you want to compare and deploy.
3.  Click the Verify and Deploy button to proceed.
4.  Review the Compare Summary in the Validate Summary pop-up and any Missing Components highlighted during the comparison.

You can download the comparison results for reference.
