# View user groups

Learn how to view user group information, including group names, tenants, and user roles, in OneID.

To view user group information in OneID, take the following steps:

1.  Navigate to Admin Console > Groups . All user groups in your organization are listed in the table, including the group name, tenant, and user role information of each user group.
2.  If a user group contains more than one tenant, click the icon at the beginning of a row to show all Zuora tenants and corresponding user roles in this group.
