2.  In the General Actions section, click Login & SMTP Credentials. The Zuora Login dialog opens.
3.  Ensure that the OAuth authentication type is selected.
4.  Enter the client ID and a client secret of your OAuth client. For more information about OAuth clients, see "Create an OAuth client for a user".
