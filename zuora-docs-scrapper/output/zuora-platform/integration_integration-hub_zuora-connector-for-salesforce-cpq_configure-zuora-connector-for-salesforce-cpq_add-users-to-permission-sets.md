# Add Users to Permission Sets

Learn how to assign Salesforce permission sets for configuring and using the Zuora Connector for Salesforce CPQ.

The Zuora Connector for Salesforce CPQ package provides two Salesforce permission sets with the permissions required to configure or use the Connector:

-   SteelBrick-Zuora CPQ Admin

For the admin user permissions needed by users managing the Product Catalog and Connector administrative settings.

-   SteelBrick-Zuora CPQ User

For the standard user permissions needed by users using the Salesforce CPQ quoting flow.

Assign the above permission setsto the users who will configure or use the Connector. See [Assign Permission Sets to a User](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=perm_sets_assigning.htm&language=en_US) if you need a detail instruction.
