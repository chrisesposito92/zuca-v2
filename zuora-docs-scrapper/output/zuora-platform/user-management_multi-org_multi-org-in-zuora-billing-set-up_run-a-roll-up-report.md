# Run a roll-up report

Learn how to consolidate standard reports at the parent org level and create a roll-up report for selected org units.

All standard reports will be consolidated and available at the parent/root org level.

The report preview will display the individual org units selected for the roll-up along with the cumulative value.

The gif below demonstrates an example of creating a rollup for an invoice data source:

1.  Navigate to the Org Switcher on the right-hand top of the screen.
2.  Select all the org units that you wish to include in the roll-up report.
3.  On the left navigation go to Reporting > Reporting
4.  Click Create New Report
5.  Create a Summary Report

    The report preview will display the individual org units selected for the roll-up along with the cumulative value.
