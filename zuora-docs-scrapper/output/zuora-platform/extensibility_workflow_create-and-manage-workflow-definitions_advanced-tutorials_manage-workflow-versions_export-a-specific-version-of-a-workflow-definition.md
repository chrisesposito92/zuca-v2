# Export a specific version of a workflow definition

Learn how to export a specific version of a workflow definition.

You can export the logic and configurations of a specific version of a workflow definition as a JSON file. The data that has been processed in this workflow version cannot be exported.

1.  Open a workflow.
2.  Click the Versions tab.
3.  On the Versions tab, click the menu icon next to the version that you need to export, and then click Export .

When you export a workflow on the Workflows tab, the active version for the workflow definition will be exported. See [Export and import a workflow](/zuora-platform/extensibility/workflow/create-and-manage-workflow-definitions/advanced-tutorials/export-and-import-a-workflow) for details.
