# Object types upgraded by Zuora 360+

Zuora 360+ enhances object type support and alters field mappings compared to Zuora 360. Invoice sync automatically switches to Zuora 360+ mode upon activation, while other objects require a support request for mode change.

The following object types are supported by both Zuora 360+ and Zuora 360. When Zuora 360+ is enabled, the field level mappings are different from Zuora 360. For the field mappings without Zuora 360+ enabled, see Zuora 360 Objects Mapping .

Note:

The sync of Invoice objects will automatically switch to the Zuora 360+ mode once you enable Zuora 360+. For other object types with Zuora 360+ enabled, the sync mode will remain unchanged unless you specifically submit a request at Zuora Global Support .
