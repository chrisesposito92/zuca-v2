# View users

Learn how to view the users currently configured for your tenant.

1.  Navigate to Administration Settings > Manage Users. The All Users page opens.
2.  Click a username to view and edit information about the user, and view the user's login history.
3.  If you want to reset the password for users who do not use SSO login, click Reset Password.

    You can deactivate a user. Inactive means this user cannot access your Zuora tenant anymore.
