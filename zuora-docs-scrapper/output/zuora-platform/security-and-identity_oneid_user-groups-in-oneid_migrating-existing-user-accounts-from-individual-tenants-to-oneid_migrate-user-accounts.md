# Migrate user accounts

Learn how to migrate local user accounts to global status in OneID, enabling seamless tenant access.

New user provisioning involves either assigning users to groups or granting them direct access to tenants, allowing them to enter the corresponding tenant environment.

Follow these steps to convert local user accounts to global status in OneID.

1.  Access the Admin console in OneID.
2.  Navigate to the Users module.
3.  Click on the Import Local User button.
4.  Select the tenant from the provided dropdown menu.
5.  Choose the local user accounts to migrate from the available user list.

Once migration is complete, activate the OneID accounts of users. Users can easily see their current tenant access on the MyApps page without needing extra group assignments or tenant access grants from OneID.
