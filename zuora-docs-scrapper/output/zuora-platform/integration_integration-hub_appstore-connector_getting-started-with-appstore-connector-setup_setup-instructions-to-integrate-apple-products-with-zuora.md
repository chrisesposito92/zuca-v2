# Setup instructions to integrate Apple products with Zuora

Learn how to integrate Apple products with Zuora for synchronized product listings and accurate subscription management.

1\. Create Apple Products in the Zuora Product Catalog (Optional)

Align Zuora product listings with Apple products available on app stores for improved management and reporting. This step is optional, as it is only necessary if you want to ensure that Zuora product listings are directly synchronized with the Apple products in the app stores, enhancing visibility and reporting accuracy.

Steps:

1.  Navigate to the Zuora Dashboard.

2.  Go to Product Catalog and select Add Product.

3.  Enter the necessary details for Apple products, including names, descriptions, and pricing information.

4.  Save the new products to the catalog.


2\. Product Mapping

Ensure that subscription changes and purchases from the app store are accurately reflected in Zuora by mapping Apple product identifiers to Zuora product rate plans.

Steps:

1.  Go to the Product Catalog in Zuora.

2.  Select Rate Plans and choose the rate plans to map.

3.  Enter the Apple product identifier (e.g., Apple SKU or Product ID) in the corresponding fields, and add it to the ExternallyManagedPlanID field as needed.

4.  Save the mappings to link Apple products with Zuora rate plans.


3\. Subscription Management

Follow guidelines to effectively manage subscriptions and billing, ensuring proper handling of subscriber accounts and payment processes.

Steps:

1.  Refer to the Omnichannel User Guide for detailed instructions related to subscription management.

2.  Follow the guide to set up and manage subscriptions, configure billing settings, and handle subscription lifecycle events.
