# Search for indexed fields

Learn how to search for the indexed fields of a specific object via the Schema Visualizer.

1.  Navigate to in the left navigation menu.
2.  On the Object Manager page, click the Schema Visualizer tab. A canvas with Zuora Billing objects opens.
3.  If the object you want to search does not belong to Zuora Billing, enable the corresponding product filter by clicking the product name in the upper left of the page. For example, if you want to search for indexed fields of the Payment Method object, enable the Payment product filter.
4.  Switch on the Show Fields toggle. All standard and custom fields of each object are displayed.
5.  Click the object name. This object is focused on the canvas.
6.  Find all indexed fields of this object in the standard and custom field list. The `(IDX)` suffix at the end of a field name indicates this is an indexed field. For example, the `BillCycleDay (IDX)` field on the Account object.
