# Create a new role under unified permission management

Learn how to create a new user role that is available across all tenants and configure permissions under unified permission management.

When a user role is created, it is available across all tenants.

To create a new role:

1.  Navigate to OneID > Admin Console > User roles and permissions .
2.  Click the Add New Role button on the top right.
3.  In the New Role dialog, enter the Role Name and select the Product Type for which the role is applicable.
4.  Click Next . You can configure the permissions for each module in your Billing tenants, and it is not required to create modular roles anymore within Billing.
5.  After configuring the permissions for the new role, click Save.
