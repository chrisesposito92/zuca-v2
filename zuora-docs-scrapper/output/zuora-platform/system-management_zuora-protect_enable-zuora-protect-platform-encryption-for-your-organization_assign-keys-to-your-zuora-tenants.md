# Assign keys to your Zuora tenants

Learn how to assign encryption keys to your Zuora tenants to enable data encryption.

After creating your encryption keys or importing your keys from your external KMS into Zuora, can you assign them to your Zuora tenants to enable data encryption.

The following steps explain how you can assign keys to your Zuora tenants:

1.  In OneID, navigate to Admin console > Encryption Key Management in the left-hand navigation section.
2.  On the Key Assignment page, click the Edit action against the Zuora tenant for which you want to encrypt the data.

You can choose an encryption key from the list of created and imported keys to assign to the Zuora Tenant.
