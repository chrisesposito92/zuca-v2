# Test the SSO configuration

Learn how to test the SSO configuration to ensure successful user login via PingOne and Zuora OneID.

After configuring SSO for users, test the setup by following these steps:

1.  In the PingOne admin console, initiate a test SSO login.
2.  Ensure Zuora OneID opens in a new tab, logging in the user via SSO.
3.  If the login fails, review any error messages and adjust the Identity Provider (IdP) or Service Provider (SP) settings as needed.
4.  Retest the SSO login until the setup works correctly.
