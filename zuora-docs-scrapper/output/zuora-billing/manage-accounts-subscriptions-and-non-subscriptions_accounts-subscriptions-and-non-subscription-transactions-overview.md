# Accounts, subscriptions, and non-subscription transactions overview

This topic explains how to manage customer accounts, subscriptions, and non-subscription transactions, including billing information, payment methods, and transaction types.

The Customer Accounts allows you to manage the billing information of the customers. This provides the key details such as company and contact information, payment terms, and preferred payment methods, while also consolidating critical records like subscriptions and amendments, invoices, payments, and adjustments.

Zuora supports both subscription and non-subscription transactions. Subscriptions can include the recurring charges such as, monthly flat fees, quarterly per-unit pricing, or usage-based charges and one-time charges like activation fees. Non-subscription transactions can be managed through order line items, representing one-time fees, physical goods, or professional services, and these can be handled independently or associated with the existing subscriptions for seamless billing.
