# Replace products in subscriptions

This topic explains how to replace a rate plan in a subscription using an order, with options for UI and REST API methods.

This tutorial demonstrates how to replace a rate plan in a subscription by creating an order. You can choose one of the following methods to replace a rate plan in a subscription:

-   Remove a rate plan from the subscription and add a product rate plan to the subscription through the UI and REST API. If you choose this method, you can set the order date as the date of today, the trigger dates of product removal as the date of today, and the trigger dates of product addition as the date of tomorrow.

-   Directly change a rate plan through the REST API. If you choose this method, you can set the order date and trigger dates of plan change as the date of today.
