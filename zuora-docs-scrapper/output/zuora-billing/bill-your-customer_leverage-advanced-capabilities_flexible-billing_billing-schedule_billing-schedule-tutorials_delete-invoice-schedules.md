# Delete invoice schedules

Learn how to delete invoice schedules that are no longer needed using the REST API or Zuora UI.

Note: The Billing Schedule feature is generally available. You can enable this feature in Sandbox and Production environments with the self-serve interface. For more information, see Enable billing features by yourself.

If an invoice schedule in Pending status is no longer needed, you can delete it.

To delete an invoice schedule through the REST API, use the Delete an invoice schedule operation.

To delete an invoice schedule through the Zuora UI, perform the following steps:

1.  In the left navigation section, navigate to Customers > Orders .
2.  On the Orders page, click the number of the order associated with the invoice schedule that you want to view information about.
3.  On the order details page, click the number of the invoice schedule that you want to delete in the basic information section.
4.  On the invoice schedule details page, click Delete in the upper right.
5.  In the displayed Confirmation dialog, click Yes to confirm invoice schedule deletion.

The corresponding invoice schedule is deleted.
