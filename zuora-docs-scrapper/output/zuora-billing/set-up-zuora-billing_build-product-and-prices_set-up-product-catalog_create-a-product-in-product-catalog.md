# Create a product in Product Catalog

Learn how to create a product in your catalog, add images for easy identification, and manage feature options for subscriptions.

Start to build your product catalog by creating a product. Optionally, you can add an image for the product to identify the product in the future quickly. After a product is ready in your catalog, you can also control whether to allow users to add or remove features for a product when creating or amending a subscription.
