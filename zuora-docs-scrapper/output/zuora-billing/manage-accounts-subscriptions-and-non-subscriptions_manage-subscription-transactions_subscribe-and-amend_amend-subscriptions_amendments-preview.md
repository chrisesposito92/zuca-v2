# Amendments preview

This article explains how to preview amendments in Zuora Billing, including supported types and subscription preview dates.

Note:

Creating and amending subscriptions in the Zuora Billing UI is only relevant for existing Subscribe and Amend customers who have not transitioned to Orders or Orders Harmonization . Any new customers will not see this UI.

You can preview amendments, similar to how you can preview subscriptions. The amendment preview presents a projected charge summary for the subscription assuming the amendment was successful.

## Supported Amendment Types

-   New product
-   Update product
-   Remove product
-   Terms & Conditions
-   Renewal

You can preview amendments that are in the Draft or Pending states.

## Subscription Preview Dates

You can preview a subscription during the period defined in Preview Start Date and Preview Through Date . The period between the preview start date and preview through date must be less than 60 months.

## Preview Start Date

The start date of the subscription preview. The subscription start date is used by default.

## Preview Through Date

The end date of the subscription preview. You can preview the invoice charges through the preview through date.
