# Billing document templates configuration

Zuora Billing enables the creation and management of customizable billing document templates, such as invoices and memos, tailored to your company's branding and information needs.

Zuora Billing allows you to easily create and manage your own templates for billing documents, including invoices, credit memos, and debit memos. For example, invoice templates are used to generate PDF invoices for your bills.

You can customize your billing document templates to have your company's look and feel (including adding your company's logo). You can also use merge fields to display only the billing and payments information you want your customers to see.

Zuora offers the following options to customize your billing document templates. Check the respective documentation based on your business needs.

-   [HTML templates](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/billing-document-templates-configuration/configure-html-templates-for-billing-documents) (recommended)

-   [Word templates](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/billing-document-templates-configuration/create-word-templates-for-invoices/overview-of-creating-word-template)


Note: The billing document templates are set at the customer level, not at the product level.
