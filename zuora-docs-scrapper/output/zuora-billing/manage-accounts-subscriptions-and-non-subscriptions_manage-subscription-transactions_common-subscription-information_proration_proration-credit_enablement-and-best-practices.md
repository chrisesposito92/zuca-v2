# Enablement and Best Practices

This topic explains how to enable the billing rule for Credit for Prorated Discounts and follow best practices for applying discount charges.

To enable this billing rule:

1.  Click your username at the upper right and navigate to Settings > Billing.
2.  On the Billing Settings page, click Define Billing Rules.
3.  On the Billing Rules page, click edit.
4.  Select Yes for Credit for Prorated Discounts (Fixed-amount Discount Charge Only).
5.  Click save.

Best practices

If you have enabled the Credit for Prorated Discounts (Fixed-amount Discount Charge Only) billing rule, the best practices to use discount charges are as follows:

-   One fixed-amount discount charge only applies to one regular charge instead of multiple regular charges.
-   The discount charge and the applied-to regular charge have the same bill cycle day, and the bill cycle day never changes.
-   The discount charge has the same activation or cancelation date as the applied-to regular charge.
