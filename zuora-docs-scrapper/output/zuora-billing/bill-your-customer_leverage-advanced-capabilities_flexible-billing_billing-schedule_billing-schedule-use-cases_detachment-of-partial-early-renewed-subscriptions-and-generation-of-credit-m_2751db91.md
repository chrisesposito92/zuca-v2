# Generation of a credit memo using standard billing process

Learn how to generate credit memos using the standard billing process after detaching subscriptions from invoice schedules.

Since you have detached C2 from IS1, you can now generate invoices for C3 and credit memos for C2 using the standard billing process, such as via bill runs.

For more information about how to bill subscription rate plan charges, see Create bill runs or the Generate billing documents by account ID API operation.

## Other use cases

For more use cases of detaching subscriptions from invoice schedules, see the following:

-   Detach partial early renewed subscriptions and generate credit memos in a new invoice schedule

-   Detach partial early renewed subscriptions in batches and generate credit memos across multiple invoice schedules

-   Detach partial early renewed subscriptions with owner transfer and generate credit memos in a new invoice schedule
