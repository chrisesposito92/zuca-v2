# How is a subscription cohort formed?

This topic explains how a subscription cohort is formed by configuring batches, associating accounts, and selecting subscription terms.

A subscription cohort is formed through the following configurations:

1.  Batches are predefined in Billing Settings > Customize Batch Names .
2.  An account is associated with a batch in the Billing and Payment Info section on the account details page.
3.  A subscription is associated with the account by specifying the subscription account during subscription creation.
4.  A subscription cohort is formed by selecting specific batches and the subscription term type through the Batch Price Update drop-down button on the Subscriptions page.
