# Why context matters?

Explore how Adaptive Context enhances product and pricing strategies by integrating diverse data sources, enabling personalized experiences, and reducing operational overhead.

In today's dynamic commerce environments, your product and pricing logic can't be static. Customer behaviour, usage patterns, geography, and subscription lifecycle stages all influence what constitutes an ideal offer. Adaptive Context bridges these signals and your monetization engine by:

-   Unifying diverse data sources (Zuora, CRM, web apps, external APIs)

-   Enabling hyper-personalized experiences at scale without custom code

-   Reducing operational overhead from managing multiple product versions

-   Allowing rapid experimentation through conditional rules and real-time evaluation
