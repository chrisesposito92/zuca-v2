# View notification histories

This task explains how to view the notification histories of an account, including email and callout histories.

To view notification histories of an account, perform the following steps:

1.  Navigate to Customers > Customer Accounts in the left navigation menu.
2.  Click the name of the account you want to view. The account detail page opens.
3.  Scroll to the Notification History section.
4.  Switch between the Email History and Callout History tab to view the email or callout histories of this account.
5.  When viewing email histories in the Email History tab, click Insights in the Action column to see delivery and engagement metrics of each email notification, including event type, event details, event count, and created and updated dates. Available event types are as follows:

    -   Delivered: Zuora successfully delivered the email to the recipient's mail server.

    -   Opened: The recipient opened the email.

    -   Clicked: The recipient clicked one or more links in the email.

    -   Bounced: The recipient's mail server rejected the email.


    Note:

    This applies only to email notifications delivered by the advanced SMTP server.
