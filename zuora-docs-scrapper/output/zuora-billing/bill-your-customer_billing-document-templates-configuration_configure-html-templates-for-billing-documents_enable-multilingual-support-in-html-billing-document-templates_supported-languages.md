# Supported languages

This document outlines the supported languages and their corresponding ISO language and country codes for billing document template translations.

The language country codes are comprised of two arguments separated by a dash, for example, fr-CA is French Canadian:

-   The first argument is a valid ISO Language Code. These codes are the lower-case two-letter codes as defined by ISO-639.

-   The second argument to both constructors is a valid ISO Country Code. These codes are the upper-case two-letter codes as defined by ISO-3166.
