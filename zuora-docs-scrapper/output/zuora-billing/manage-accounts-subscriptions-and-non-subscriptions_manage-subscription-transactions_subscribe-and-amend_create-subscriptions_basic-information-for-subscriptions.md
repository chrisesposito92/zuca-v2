# Basic information for subscriptions

This article provides guidance on entering basic information for subscriptions, including setting termed or evergreen subscriptions, renewals, and optional fields.

## Overview

You must enter basic information when creating a subscription. This article explains how to set termed or evergreen subscriptions, renewals, and other basic information.

## Subscriptions information

You can specify the terms for your subscription by entering information for each field under Basic Information. The Notes , Subscription Number , and Term Start Date fields are optional ( Subscription Number and Term Start Date are located in the Additional Fields section). All other fields are required.

## Termed and Evergreen subscriptions

The Term Setting specifies if a subscription has a set term after which it expires or if the subscription is evergreen and never expires. Evergreen subscriptions have no end date, which means your customer will be automatically billed until the subscription is canceled. A termed subscription expires after the number of periods specified in the initial term, and can be set to renew for additional renewal terms.

-   An Evergreen subscription never expires and does not require renewal.
-   A Term subscription has a pre-defined Initial Term, Renewal Setting, Term Start Date, Term End Date, and Renewal Term. You can set term subscriptions to renew automatically (Auto Renew).
