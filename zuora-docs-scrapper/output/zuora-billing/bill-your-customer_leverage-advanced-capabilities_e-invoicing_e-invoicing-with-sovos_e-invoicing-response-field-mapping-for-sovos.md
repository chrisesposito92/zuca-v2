# E-invoicing response field mapping for Sovos

The e-invoicing response field mapping for Sovos aligns Sovos response data with the EInvoiceData object in Zuora, enabling customization of field mapping rules at the business region level.

The e-invoicing response field mapping for Sovos maps values in Sovos response data, which includes additional information generated by the tax authority, to fields on the EInvoiceData object in Zuora.

After an e-invoicing document is successfully processed in Sovos, Sovos sends the billing-document-related information such as the reference number, QR code data, authorization code, and so on, in the response data.

You can configure response field mappings at the business region level to customize the field mapping rules of the EInvoiceData object.

For [pre-integrated countries](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/leverage-advanced-capabilities/e-invoicing/e-invoicing-with-sovos/supported-countries), the default response field mappings have been configured and cannot be changed. However, you can set up your own response field mappings for non-pre-integrated countries.

Note:

You can only extract fields directly from the response payload; data extraction from embedded files (such as XML) within the response is not supported. For example, under Mexico’s e-invoicing mandates, certain fields are included in the approved XML file embedded in the response. If those fields need to be shown on the printable invoice (for example, in PDF), you will need to parse the embedded XML file on your own.

For more information, see [Country-specific configurations management](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/leverage-advanced-capabilities/e-invoicing/country-specific-configurations-management).

## Configure e-invoicing response field mappings for Sovos

To configure e-invoicing response field mappings for Sovos, see [Configure e-invoicing response field mappings](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/leverage-advanced-capabilities/e-invoicing/e-invoicing-feature-configuration/configure-e-invoicing-response-field-mappings).

## Supported response fields

The following table lists supported e-invoicing response fields. Most of these fields are from the EInvoiceData object, except for the `EInvoiceFile` field.

| Field name | Format | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EInvoiceFile | String | This field is used to store the cleared e-invoice file returned from the tax authority.This is not a field on the EInvoiceData object. Zuora retrieves the cleared e-invoice file according to this field and stores the file ID in the EInvoiceFileId field on billing documents. You can download the file with the Retrieve a file API operation. |
| AuthorizationCode | String | This field is used to store the authorization code issued by the administration when the e-invoicing data of a billing document is approved by the tax authority. |
| QrCode | String | This field is used to store the QR code generated by the tax authority.You do not need to map this field if the tax authority does not provide a QR code. |
| ReferenceNumber | String | This field is used to store the unique number generated by the tax authority.You do not need to map this field if the tax authority does not provide this number. |
| Field1 - Field10 | String | These reserved fields are used to store additional information. You can map any values in the Sovos response data to these fields to meet your business needs.The maximum number of characters for the fields are as follows:Field1 to Field5 : 2048Field6 to Field10 : 8192 |

## Field path format

A field path in a field mapping configuration is a string that indicates a node in Sovos’ XML response payload, and the string must comply with the XML Path Language (XPath) syntax.

For more information, see [XPath syntax for e-invoicing response field mapping](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/leverage-advanced-capabilities/e-invoicing/e-invoicing-feature-configuration/xpath-syntax-for-e-invoicing-response-field-mapping).

| Field name | Field path | Selected content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EInvoiceFile | //cac:DocumentReference[cbc:DocumentTypeCode='LegalCleared']/cac:Attachment/cbc:EmbeddedDocumentBinaryObject/text() | ZXlKaGJH…nN3c= |
