# Pre-requisites for dynamic pricing

Learn about the necessary permissions required to enable and use Dynamic Pricing, including access to the Product Catalog, Dynamic Pricing rules, and contextual attributes.

To enable and use Dynamic Pricing, the following settings must be configured in your tenant:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Catalog Beta | True |
| Order on OH | True |
| AttributeBasedPricingCD | False |

Note:

Before requesting Dynamic Pricing enablement, ensure that these settings align with your business use cases and do not impact existing workflows or integrations in your tenant.
