# Notes

Guidelines for handling transactions with a maximum of 256 invoice lines and support contact information.

Each transaction can have a maximum of 256 (single invoice items) lines, if it exceeds that limit the transaction will fail. Contact [Vertex customer support](https://www.vertexinc.com/support-services/customer-support) if you need to increase this max limit on a case-by-case basis.
