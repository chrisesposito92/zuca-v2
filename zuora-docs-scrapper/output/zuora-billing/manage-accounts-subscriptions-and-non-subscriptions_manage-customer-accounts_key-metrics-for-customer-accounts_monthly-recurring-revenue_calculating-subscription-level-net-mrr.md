# Calculating subscription-level Net MRR

This task provides examples and steps for calculating subscription-level Net MRR, including how discounts are allocated and how charge-level MRRs are calculated and aggregated.

This section has several examples to show the calculation process of subscription-level Net MRR, as follows:

1.  How discounts are allocated to regular charges in different scenarios.
2.  And then how charge-level MRRs (Gross, Discount, and Net MRRs) are calculated for regular charges in these scenarios.
3.  Finally how charge-level MRRs are added up to get the subscription-level MRR.
