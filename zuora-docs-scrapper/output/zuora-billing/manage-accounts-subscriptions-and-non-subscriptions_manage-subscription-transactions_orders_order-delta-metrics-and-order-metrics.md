# Order Delta Metrics and Order Metrics

This topic provides information about Order Delta Metrics or Order Metrics, highlighting the updated methodologies for calculating key metrics in Zuora as the result of an order.

Note:

As of Zuora Billing Release 306, Order Metrics is no longer available. Zuora has updated the methodologies for calculating metrics in Orders. The new methodologies are reflected in the following Order Delta Metrics objects.

It is recommended that all customers use the new Order Delta Metrics . If you are an existing Order Metrics customer and want to migrate to Order Delta Metrics, submit a request at Zuora Global Support . Whereas new customers, and existing customers not currently on Order Metrics, will no longer have access to Order Metrics, existing customers currently using Order Metrics will continue to be supported.
