# E-invoicing service providers configuration

This topic covers information on configuring and managing third-party e-invoicing service providers using the Zuora UI or REST API.

To integrate with a third-party e-invoicing service provider, you must set it up as your e-invoicing service provider through the Zuora UI or REST API. For example, to connect with Sovos, you must obtain authentication keys from Sovos, and then set up Sovos as your e-invoicing service provider.

To configure and manage your e-invoicing service providers through the REST API, use the following operations:

-   [Create an e-invoicing service provider](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_EInvoicingServiceProvider/)

-   [List e-invoicing service](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/GET_EInvoicingServiceProviders/)

-   [Retrieve an e-invoicing service provider](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/GET_EInvoicingServiceProvider/)

-   [Update an e-invoicing service provider](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/PUT_UpdateEInvoicingServiceProvider/)

-   [Delete an e-invoicing service provider](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/DELETE_EInvoicingServiceProvider/)
