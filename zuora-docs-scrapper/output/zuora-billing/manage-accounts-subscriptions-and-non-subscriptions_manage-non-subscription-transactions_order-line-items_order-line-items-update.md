# Order line items update

This topic gives an overview of updating order line items using the Zuora UI or API, and understand the impact of order states on editability.

There are two ways to update an order line item:

-   In the Zuora UI, access the order line item details page and then update the order line item.

-   Use the "Update an order line item" operation.


Note:

Whether an order line item can be edited is also dependent on the state of the order line item. See State transitions for an order line item, fulfillment, and order for more information about the state.

A sales order line item and a return order line item have different editable fields. See Update an order line item for more information about the differences.
