# Bill your customers overview

Zuora Billing streamlines the billing lifecycle with features like branded invoices, automated billing runs, and complex pricing management, ensuring a seamless experience for subscription and non-subscription businesses.

Zuora Billing is a unified platform that streamlines the entire billing lifecycle for both subscription and non-subscription businesses. From creating branded invoices to automating billing runs and managing complex usage-based pricing, Zuora delivers the accuracy, flexibility, and compliance needed to provide a seamless billing experience.

With billing document templates, you can design invoices, credit memos, and debit memos that reflect your company’s brand and information needs. Templates can be built in HTML (recommended) or Word and use merge fields to control which billing and payment details are displayed. Templates are applied at the customer level, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all billing documents.

Zuora also supports automated billing and usage management. Invoices can be generated on demand or scheduled for individual accounts or at scale. The Invoice Settlement feature automatically creates credit memos for negative charges, while Zuora’s rating engine ensures accurate billing even when subscriptions change or complex pricing models are applied. For usage-based billing, Zuora supports multiple charge models—such as tiered, volume, overage, and multi-attribute pricing—as well as prepayments, credits, and commitments.

Beyond standard invoicing, Zuora offers advanced features including Unified Invoicing for subscription and non-subscription charges in a single view, Flexible Billing for more granular control of billing and taxation, Delivery-Based Billing for recurring deliveries and adjustments, and E-Invoicing to meet global compliance requirements. Together, these capabilities provide a single platform to manage all your billing needs and scale revenue operations confidently across global markets.
