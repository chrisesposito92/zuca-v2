# Account Summary Statement

Access periodic reports summarizing account transactions, including invoices, credit memos, and payments, to efficiently communicate customer financial statuses.

Using Summary Statements, you can access periodic reports summarizing account transaction activities, including outstanding invoices, credit memos, and payments within customizable timeframes — typically a month, quarter, year, or another customized interval. These reports facilitate swift communication of a customer’s status, highlighting whether payments are up-to-date or if there are any outstanding invoices.

Note:

This is not a Balance-Forward Statement. Balance values are not maintained in the database for periodic utilization in consecutively generated documents. While a balance-forward statement typically replaces invoices and debit/credit memos, it's important to note that, at its current stage, this report does not fulfil the necessary requirements for replacing a legal billing document.

With Summary Statements, you can:

-   Gain insights into the subscribers’ financial health via comprehensive account-level reporting.

-   Enable efficient communication of customer financial statuses through customizable HTML templates and batch generation options.

-   Facilitate reminder notifications for overdue payments.

-   Enable subscriber personalization where full customization is available through the HTML template editor. This will help you to tailor professional notices directly from the Zuora platform immediately upon generation.
    Note: This feature is in the Early Availability phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. To manage and access features from the self-service interface, see Manage Features.
