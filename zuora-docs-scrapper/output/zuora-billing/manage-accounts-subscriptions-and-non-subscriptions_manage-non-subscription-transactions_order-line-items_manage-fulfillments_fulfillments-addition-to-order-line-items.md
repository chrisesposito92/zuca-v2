# Fulfillments addition to order line items

This topic explains about adding fulfillments to activated order line items with specific billing rules and states.

You can add fulfillments to existing order line items that have been activated. A fulfillment can be added to an order line item only when the billing rule of the order line item is configured as `Trigger As Fulfillment` `Occurs` and the order line item is in the `Booked` state.

## Add fulfillments to sales order line items

You can add fulfillments to sales order line items either through Zuora UI or API.
