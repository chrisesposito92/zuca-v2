# Product catalog settings

Configure product catalog settings to manage charge types and models for billing customers effectively.

When creating product rate plan charges, you must specify the charge model that determines how your customers will be billed. Use product catalog settings to enable the charge types and charge models your organization uses and disable the ones not used.
