# Remove a discount charge

Learn how to remove a discount charge and ensure all related charges are recalculated and synced.

If you are to remove a discount charge, remove not only the discount charge but also the corresponding applied-to charges. Then, run the bill run so that both charges' credit amounts are re-calculated and synced. Note that the removal of a discount charge does not generate a credit memo or invoice item adjustment for the discount charge itself.
