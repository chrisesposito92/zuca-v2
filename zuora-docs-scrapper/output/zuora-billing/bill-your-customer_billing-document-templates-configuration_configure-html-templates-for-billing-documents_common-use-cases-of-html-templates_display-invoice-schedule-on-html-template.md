# Display invoice schedule on HTML template

Explore how to display invoice schedules and items on HTML templates to improve billing transparency and support milestone-based billing.

Zuora supports displaying Invoice Schedule and Invoice Schedule Item information on HTML invoice templates. This feature enables you to present detailed billing schedules, including milestones and custom data, directly on customer invoices for improved transparency and milestone-based billing scenarios.

You can access all standard and custom fields using the `InvoiceSchedule` and `InvoiceScheduleItem` objects in the HTML template.

Note: This feature is available for both invoices and credit memos.
