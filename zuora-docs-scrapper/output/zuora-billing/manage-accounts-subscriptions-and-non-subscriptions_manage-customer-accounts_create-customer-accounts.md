# Customer accounts creation

This topic explains about creating customer accounts in Zuora, add bill-to contacts, and set a default payment method. Note limitations on account names and VAT ID usage.

You can create a customer account from the Zuora application, and add bill-to contacts and a default payment method.

Path separators cannot be contained in account names. UTF-8 4-byte characters are not supported in account names or bill-to contacts' first and last names.

## Use SOAP or REST APIs to Create Customer Accounts

See SOAP API Account object.

See REST API Create Account method.

## Using a VAT ID

If you are using Avalara, you can specify a European Union Value Added Tax identification number for a customer account. To add an EU VAT ID to a customer account, enter an identification number in the VAT ID field when you create the customer account.

Note:

This feature is in the Early Adopter phase. If you want to have access to the feature, submit a request at Zuora Global Support .
