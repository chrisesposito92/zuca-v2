# Subscriptions creation

This article explain create a customer account before creating subscriptions and understanding the limitations of Zuora Billing UI for existing Subscribe and Amend customers.

You must first create a customer account before you can create a subscription. Once you have made a customer account, you can create subscriptions for that account.

Note:

Creating and amending subscriptions in the Zuora Billing UI is:

-   Only relevant for existing Subscribe and Amend customers who have not transitioned to Orders or Orders Harmonization. Any new customers will not see this UI.
-   Restricted if you are an existing Subscribe and Amend customer and have enabled Order Metrics only. See Known Limitations in Orders and Order Metrics.
