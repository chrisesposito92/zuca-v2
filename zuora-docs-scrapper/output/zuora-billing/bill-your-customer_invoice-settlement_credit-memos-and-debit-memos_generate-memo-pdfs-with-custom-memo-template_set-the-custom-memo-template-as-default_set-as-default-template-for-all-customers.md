# Set as default template for all customers

Learn how to set as default template for all customers

You can set a credit memo or debit memo template as the default template in Zuora Billing setting. The default memo template is used to generate the memo PDFs for all customers.

To set a memo template as the default template for all customers, complete these steps.

1.  Log in to the Zuora application with administrative privileges.
2.  Click your username at the top right and click Billing > Manage Billing Document Configuration.
3.  In the Manage Invoice, Credit/Debit Memo Templates tab, click make default next to the template.

    Note:

    When selecting 'Default Template' on Customer Accounts, the Credit/Debit Memo template currently configured as System Default Template in the Billing Settings is applied. When you change the System Default Templates to a different one, the Account-level Credit/Debit Memos are not updated accordingly.
