# Subscription Product Features Management

This explains explains how to manage product features in subscriptions, including adding, removing, and editing features during subscription creation or amendment.

This article describes how to add, remove, and edit a product feature while creating a new subscription or an amendment.

## Overview

To create features in the product catalog and use them in subscriptions and Zuora Quotes, you need to enable the following:

-   The Entitlements setting in your tenant. Access to the Entitlements feature requires a specific edition of Zuora. See Zuora Editions for details.
-   The Enable Feature Specification in Product and Subscriptions setting in the Billing Settings.

Additionally, to be able to add, remove, or edit a feature in subscriptions and amendments, you need to enable the Allow Feature Changes in Subscriptions setting in the product.

If you are an Orders customer, you can add, remove, or edit a feature through the "Orders API" operations. For more information, see the release note . However, the Orders UI does not support the product features function. The Subscribe and Amend UI in Orders Harmonization environment does not have this limit.
