# Subscriptions view through the Zuora UI

This topic explains how to view subscription details through the Zuora UI, including single version, versioned, and omnichannel subscriptions.

-   For single version subscriptions, see View details of single version subscriptions .
-   For versioned subscriptions, the Subscriptions and subscription details pages display differently when Enable the new UI experience is checked or unchecked. You need to read the following articles in different situations:
    -   If the new UI experience is turned on, see View details of subscriptions through the reinvented UI .
    -   If the new UI experience is turned off, see View subscriptions .
-   For omnichannel subscriptions, see View omnichannel subscriptions .
