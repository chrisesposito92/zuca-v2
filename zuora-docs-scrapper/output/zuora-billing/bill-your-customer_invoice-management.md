# Invoice management

Manage invoices generated from bill runs, including making adjustments, reversals, and write-offs.

An invoice is generated from a [bill run](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/bill-runs/automate-billing-document-generation/overview-of-bill-runs). Invoices are the bills that you send to your customers. After an invoice is generated, you might need to make changes before payment is collected. For example, you might want to change the invoice date, delete or reverse an incorrect invoice, write off or reverse posted invoices, or split a single invoice into multiple ones.

Note: Some operations require the Invoice Settlement feature to be enabled, such as invoice reversal or invoice write-off.
