# Bill runs cancelation

Understand how to cancel a bill run to prevent payments and manage associated credit memos.

Canceling a bill run prevents payments from being collected for the invoices created in your bill run. You can cancel a bill run that is completed and that has no posted invoices in it. You can also cancel a pending bill run. You can still view a canceled bill run. Once a bill run is posted, you will not be able to cancel it. After canceling a bill run, you can delete it.

If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, when you cancel a bill run, all the bill run associated credit memos are also canceled.
