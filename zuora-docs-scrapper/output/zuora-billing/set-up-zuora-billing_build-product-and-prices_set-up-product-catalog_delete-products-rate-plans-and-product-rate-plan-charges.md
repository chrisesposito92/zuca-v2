# Delete products, rate plans, and product rate plan charges

Learn how to manage the expiration and deletion of products, rate plans, and product rate plan charges in subscriptions.

To preserve historical data, products, rate plans, and product rate plan charges that have been added to a subscription can expire, but cannot be deleted. You can make products and rate plans expire by editing their effective end date. However, you can delete products, rate plans, and rate plan charges that have not been added to a subscription.
