# Create an external non-referenced refund

Steps to create an external non-reference refund

1.  Open the customer account detail page.
2.  Scroll down to the Transactions section.
3.  Select the Credit Balance tab. Zuora displays the credit balances created for the customer account.
4.  Click Refund Credit Balance. A page opens for you to enter the refund.
5.  For the Refund Type field, select External Refund.
6.  Select the refund method that you will use to pay for the refund.
7.  (Optional): Edit the refund amount. The amount available for refund is displayed by default.
8.  (Optional): Select a reason code for the refund. Reason codes are a way that you can include additional information or business process context on payment operations transactions. This list contains all of the credit balance refund reason codes that are active in your Zuora tenant.
9.  Click Refund Credit Balance.
10.  (Optional): Enter a reference ID (such as a check number) and comment. Zuora displays a confirmation dialog.
11.  Click Yes to refund the credit balance.

     When the credit balance is refunded, Zuora changes the refund status to Processed and displays a Refund page that shows the refund number and related information.
