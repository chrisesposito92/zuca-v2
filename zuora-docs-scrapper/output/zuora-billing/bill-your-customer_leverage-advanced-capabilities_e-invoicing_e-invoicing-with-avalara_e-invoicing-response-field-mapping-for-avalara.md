# E-invoicing response field mapping for Avalara

Details the mapping of e-invoicing response fields from Avalara to the EInvoiceData object in Zuora, including configuration options and supported fields.

The e-invoicing response field mapping for Avalara maps values in returned files from tax authorities to fields on the EInvoiceData object in Zuora.

After an e-invoicing document is successfully processed by the tax authority, Zuora extracts the returned file from Avalara. The file contains information such as the reference number, QR code data, authorization code, and so on.

You can configure response field mappings at the business region level to customize the field mapping rules of the EInvoiceData object.

Note: To configure e-invoicing response field mappings for Avalara, see [Configure e-invoicing response field mappings](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/leverage-advanced-capabilities/e-invoicing/e-invoicing-feature-configuration/configure-e-invoicing-response-field-mappings) .

## Supported response fields

The following table lists supported e-invoicing response fields on the EInvoiceData object.

Note:

In Avalara’s integration, the e-invoice file returned from the tax authority is already stored in the billing documents. You can find the file ID in the `EInvoiceFileId` field on billing documents and download the file with the [Retrieve a file](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/GET_Files/) API operation. Therefore, Avalara integration does not support customizing the response field mapping for the `EInvoiceFile` field.

| Field name | Format | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AuthorizationCode | String | This field is used to store the authorization code issued by the administration when the e-invoicing data of a billing document is approved by the tax authority. |
| QrCode | String | This field is used to store the QR code generated by the tax authority.You do not need to map this field if the tax authority does not provide a QR code. |
| ReferenceNumber | String | This field is used to store the unique number generated by the tax authority.You do not need to map this field if the tax authority does not provide this number. |
| Field1 - Field10 | String | These reserved fields are used to store additional information. You can map any values in the tax authority’s returned file to these fields to meet your business needs.The maximum number of characters for the fields are as follows:Field1 to Field5 : 2048Field6 to Field10 : 8192 |

## Field path format

A field path in a field mapping configuration is a string that indicates a node in the XML file returned by the tax authority, and the string must comply with the XML Path Language (XPath) syntax.

For more information, see [XPath syntax for e-invoicing response field mapping](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/leverage-advanced-capabilities/e-invoicing/e-invoicing-feature-configuration/xpath-syntax-for-e-invoicing-response-field-mapping).
