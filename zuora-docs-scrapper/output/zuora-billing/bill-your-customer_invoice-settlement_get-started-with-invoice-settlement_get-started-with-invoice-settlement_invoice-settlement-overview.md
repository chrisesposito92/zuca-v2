# Invoice Settlement overview

Enables advanced payment management with unapplied payments, credit and debit memos, and line-item level settlements

Invoice Settlement provides you the advanced payment management, credit and debit memos, and item-level transactions.

-   With the Unapplied Payments feature, you can create unapplied payments, apply unapplied payments on invoices and debit memos, unapply applied payments, and transfer payments.

-   With the Credit and Debit Memos feature, you can issue memos to correct invoices and manage the balance due on a particular invoice or account.

-   With the Invoice Item Settlement feature, you can apply payments at the line-item level.


If you are unsure whether Invoice Settlement is enabled for your tenant, you can check it from Zuora UI under the Billing section in the left navigation:

-   If you can see Credit Memos and Debit Memos, Invoice Settlement is enabled.

-   If you can see Invoice Adjustments and Invoice Item Adjustments, Invoice Settlement is not enabled yet.


Note:

The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memos, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to have access to the feature, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist Guide](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-settlement/get-started-with-invoice-settlement/invoice-settlement-migration-checklist-and-guide) for more information. After Invoice Settlement is enabled, the Invoice Item Adjustment feature will be deprecated for your tenant.

Note that if you have enabled Invoice Settlement Harmonization in your tenant, you can see Credit Memos, Debit Memos, and Invoice Item Adjustments.
