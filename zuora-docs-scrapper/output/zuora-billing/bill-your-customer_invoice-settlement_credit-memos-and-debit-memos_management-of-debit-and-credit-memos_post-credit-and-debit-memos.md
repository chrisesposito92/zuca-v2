# Post credit and debit memos

Post the credit and debit memos to activate them

After you have created draft credit memos or debit memos, you must post the memos to activate them. You can post credit memos and debit memos only if you have the Billing permission .

To post memos through the Zuora REST API, see [PUT Post Credit Memo](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/operation/PUT_PostCreditMemo/) and [PUT Post Debit Memo](https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/operation/PUT_PostDebitMemo/).

To post memos through the Zuora UI, use the following pages:

-   [The memo detail page](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-settlement/credit-memos-and-debit-memos/management-of-debit-and-credit-memos/post-credit-and-debit-memos/post-a-credit-or-debit-memo-from-the-memo-detail-page)

-   [The memo list page](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-settlement/credit-memos-and-debit-memos/management-of-debit-and-credit-memos/post-credit-and-debit-memos/post-a-credit-or-debit-memo-from-the-memo-list-page)
