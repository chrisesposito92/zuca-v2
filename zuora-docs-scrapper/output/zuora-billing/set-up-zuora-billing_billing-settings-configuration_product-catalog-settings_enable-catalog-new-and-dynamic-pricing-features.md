# Enable Catalog New and Dynamic Pricing features

Learn how to enable Catalog New and Dynamic Pricing directly in your tenant without submitting a support request.

-   You must have permission to access .

-   Required [prerequisite configurations](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zuora-billing/set-up-zuora-billing/build-product-and-prices/dynamic-pricing/pre-requisites-for-dynamic-pricing) for Dynamic Pricing must be completed.


You can now enable Zuora's latest catalog and pricing capabilities directly from your tenant settings without submitting a support ticket.

If your tenant previously had Catalog New or Dynamic Pricing enabled through the legacy T9 configuration, those settings are preserved in the Feature Management UI.

1.  In Zuora Billing, in the right navigation, click Settings.
2.  Click Billing.
3.  Click Manage Features.
4.  On the Feature Management page, select the Commerce tab.
5.  Locate Catalog New or Dynamic Pricing in the features list. Each feature will show its current status, for example, Available to Enable.

    Note:

    Zuora checks prerequisite configurations and incompatible settings before enabling the feature. If required setup is missing, the UI displays what must be updated before you can continue.

6.  Repeat the step if you need to enable the second feature.

    Note:

    Disabling Catalog New or Dynamic Pricing is not yet supported through the Feature Management UI. If you need the Feature to be turned off after enablement, contact Zuora Support to coordinate the change and avoid downstream data or operational issues.


The selected Commerce capability is now enabled for your tenant.
