# Products and Rate Plans Addition

This article provides guidance on creating and amending subscriptions in the Zuora Billing UI, specifically for existing Subscribe and Amend customers, and details the process of adding products and rate plans to subscriptions.

Note:

Creating and amending subscriptions in the Zuora Billing UI is:

-   Only relevant for existing Subscribe and Amend customers who have not transitioned to Orders or Orders Harmonization. Any new customers will not see this UI.

-   Restricted if you are an existing Subscribe and Amend customer and have enabled Order Metrics only. See Known Limitations in Orders and Order Metrics.


When adding products and rate plans to your subscription, you can choose from the active products and rate plans available in your product catalog. If you would like to choose a product that is not active, uncheck the checkbox Only include products currently effective. Once you are done selecting the products and rate plans, you can specify the price, quantity, and charge description for the charges.
