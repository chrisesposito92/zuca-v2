# Display exchange rates on billing documents

Learn how to display foreign exchange rates on billing documents using custom objects or the FxCustomRate object.

You can display foreign exchange (FX) rates on invoices, credit memos, and debit memos using one of the following methods:

-   Use Custom Objects – If you are not using the Custom Exchange Rates feature, you can store and retrieve FX rates through custom objects. This method requires creating and maintaining your own custom data structure to manage exchange rates.

-   Use the FxCustomRate Object – If the Custom Exchange Rates feature is enabled , you can directly use the out-of-the-box FxCustomRate object to retrieve and display exchange rates on billing documents. This standard object simplifies exchange rate access and eliminates the need for custom object configurations. For more information, see Displaying exchange rates using FxCustomRate.
