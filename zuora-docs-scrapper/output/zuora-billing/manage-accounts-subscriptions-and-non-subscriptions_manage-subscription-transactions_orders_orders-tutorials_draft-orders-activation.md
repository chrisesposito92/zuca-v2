# Draft orders activation

This topic explains how to activate a draft order to transition it from Draft status to either Pending or Completed status based on specific conditions.

You can activate a draft order to change it from Draft status to Pending or Completed status under the following conditions:

-   If an order is saved as a draft order with some dates unfilled like the dates unfilled for a pending order, once you activate the order, the order will change from Draft status to Pending status. For information about the dates unfilled for a pending order, see Activate a pending subscription or order .

-   If an order has other configurations not finished rather than the preceding unfilled dates, once you activate the order, the order will change from Draft status to Completed status.
