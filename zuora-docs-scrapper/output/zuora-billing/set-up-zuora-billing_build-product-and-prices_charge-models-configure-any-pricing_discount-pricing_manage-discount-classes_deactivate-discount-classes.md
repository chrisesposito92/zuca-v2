Learn how to deactivate a discount class when it is not used in any discount product rate plan charges.

To deactivate a discount class:

1.  In the Actions column of the existing discount class, click Deactivate .
2.  When you are prompted from confirmation, click OK .

    -   If the discount class is not used by any discount product rate plan charges, you do not need to perform any further action. The discount class is successfully deactivated.

    -   If the discount class is used by discount product rate plan charges, a message is displayed to indicate the current discount class cannot be deactivated.
