# Enable the Digital Signature feature

Learn how to enable the Digital Signature feature by following these steps.

To use the Digital Signature feature, perform the following steps:

1.  Ensure that you have the [E-Invoicing](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/leverage-advanced-capabilities/e-invoicing/e-invoicing-overview) feature enabled.
2.  Ensure that you have correctly configured the e-invoicing service provider. The Digital Signature feature utilizes the same authentication keys as the e-invoicing service provider.
3.  Submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/).
