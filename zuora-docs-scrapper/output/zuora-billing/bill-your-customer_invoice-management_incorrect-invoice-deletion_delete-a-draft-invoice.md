# Delete a draft invoice

Learn how to delete an invoice in draft status, understand about unpost and cancel the invoice.

Only the invoice in draft status can be deleted. If the invoice has been posted, you must first unpost it by using the Cancel Post menu option. Then, the invoice will change to draft. You can only unpost invoices that are not associated with payments or adjustments.

To delete an invoice in draft status, complete the following steps:

Note: PDFs cannot be generated once an invoice has been canceled. However, if a PDF was already generated before the invoice was cancelled, it can still be downloaded or viewed afterward.

1.  Log in to the Zuora application and navigate to Billing > Invoices.
2.  Find the target invoice, and open the invoice detail page. The target invoice must be in draft status.
3.  To cancel the invoice, click the three vertical dots icon and then Cancel Invoice. ![cancel-invoice.png](https://zuora.deploy.heretto.com/v4/deployments/QPAZk6lsgXwvotedNERE/object/8227d7cd-b9d5-4f2d-88e1-c15e1ef976c7?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJodHRwczovL2pvcnNlay5jb20vZXpkX29yZ2FuaXphdGlvbiI6Inp1b3JhIiwiaHR0cHM6Ly9qb3JzZWsuY29tL2V6ZC9vYmplY3RfdXVpZCI6IjgyMjdkN2NkLWI5ZDUtNGYyZC04OGUxLWMxNWUxZWY5NzZjNyIsImV4cCI6MTc2NjY1MTUwMywianRpIjoiMmRlMWZiOTBiZGEyNDA2NjhiNTdlNGQ5MDM2YjIwMzgiLCJodHRwczovL2pvcnNlay5jb20vZXpkX2ZpbGVzZXQiOiJWZHdCeUJjM0lBa01wRU9LSFdxZCJ9.JQ_FU3e1xDbXic0PG6JmXrudct2c2YjPpdsIR1FJX1w)
