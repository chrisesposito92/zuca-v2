# TCV of charges

Total Contract Value (TCV) represents the value of one-time and recurring charges, excluding usage charges, and is useful for planning expenditure and managing business growth.

To find the TCV value for a charge, use Zuora APIs:

-   In the Zuora REST API, use the tcv field in the Get subscriptions by key or Get subscriptions by account method.
-   In the Zuora SOAP API, use the TCV field on the RatePlanCharge object.
