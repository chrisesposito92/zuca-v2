# Billing transaction type mapping

Describes how the various transaction types for the billing transactions are mapped from Zuora Billing to Zuora Revenue for the Order to Revenue feature.

## Invoice

To determine the mapping for billing transactions of the Invoice business type, the following data points are considered to determine the mapped transaction type in Zuora Revenue:

-   The source of the invoice item

-   The sign of the billed amount (positive or negative) and the sign of the booking amount (positive or negative)

-   The Exclude Item Booking From Revenue Accounting exclusion flag on the invoice item

-   Whether the invoice item is generated for an account-level discount charge


Note:

If any text is larger than the limitation, Zuora Revenue will truncate the text.

Mapping for a billing transaction of the Invoice business type is listed in the table:

| Source of Invoice Item | Determination | Zuora Revenue transaction type | Considered as Standalone in Revenue? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subscription | The sign of the booking amount is the same as the sign of the billed amount. | INV | No |
| Subscription | The sign of the booking amount is different from the sign of the billed amount. | CM-C | No |
| Standalone invoice | Billing transaction for a standalone invoice | INV | Yes |
| Order Line Item | Order Line Item of the Sales item category | INV | No |
| Any of the above | When the Exclude Item Booking From Revenue Accounting exclusion flag on the invoice item is checked, or the charge is an account-level discount, regardless of any other factors, the billing transaction is considered as a standalone invoice in Zuora Revenue. | INV | Yes |

## Credit Memo

To determine the mapping for billing transactions of the Credit Memo business type, the following data points are considered to determine the mapped transaction type in Zuora Revenue:

-   Source of the credit memo item

-   The sign of the billed amount (positive or negative) and the sign of the booking amount (positive or negative)

-   The Exclude Item Booking From Revenue Accounting exclusion flag on the credit memo item

-   Whether the credit memo is generated for an account-level discount charge


Mapping for a billing transaction of the Credit Memo business type is listed in the table:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subscription | The sign of the booking amount is the same as the sign of the billed amount. | INV | No |
