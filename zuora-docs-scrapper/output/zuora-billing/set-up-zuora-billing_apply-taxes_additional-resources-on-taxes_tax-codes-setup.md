# Tax codes setup

Learn how to configure tax codes for various tax engines and manage accounting codes effectively.

You can configure tax codes for multiple tax engines ([Zuora Tax](/zuora-billing/set-up-zuora-billing/apply-taxes/overview-of-zuora-tax), Avalara tax engine, and [Connect Tax Engines](/zuora-billing/set-up-zuora-billing/apply-taxes/additional-resources-on-taxes/connect-tax-engines)) based on mapping rules.

You must configure the Accounting Code after activating the Tax Code. For more information on configuring the Accounting Code, see Configure Accounting Codes.You need not configure the Accounting Code upon activation of an existing tax code if the Accounting Code is already configured.
Note: Ensure that each invoice is associated with only one tax engine when configuring tax codes and subscriptions.
