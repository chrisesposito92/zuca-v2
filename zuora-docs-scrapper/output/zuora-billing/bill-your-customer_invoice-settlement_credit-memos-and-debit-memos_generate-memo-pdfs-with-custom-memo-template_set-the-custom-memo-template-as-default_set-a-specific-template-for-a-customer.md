# Set a specific template for a customer

Learn how to set a specific template for a customer

You can set a specific credit memo or debit memo template for a particular customer in the customer's profile. The template for a particular customer overrides the default template you set in Zuora Billing setting. For example, you make the Template\_1 template as default for credit memos in Zuora Billing setting and then set the Template\_2 template as the credit memo template in a customer's profile. The Template\_2 template is used to generate PDFs for that customer.

To set a specific memo template for a customer, complete these steps.

1.  Navigate to Customers > Customer Accounts in the navigation section.
2.  Click the customer account you want to edit.
3.  In the Billing and Payment Info section, click edit.
4.  From the Credit Memo Template or Debit Memo Template list, click the template name.
5.  Click save.
