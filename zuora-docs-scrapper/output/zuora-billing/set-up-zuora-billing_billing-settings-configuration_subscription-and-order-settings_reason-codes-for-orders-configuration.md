# Reason codes for orders configuration

This topic explains the reason codes for order transactions to manage returns and defaults.

You can use reason codes for order transactions to record or track reasons for returning orders. You can add new reason codes, edit or deactivate the existing reason codes, or set an existing reason code as the default one.

Note:

Access to Configure Reason Codes in Billing is visible only in tenants with orders enabled. For more information on how to enable Orders, see Orders .
