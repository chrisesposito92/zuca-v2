# Bundles in Product Catalog

Bundles allow you to sell multiple products as a single offer, maintaining visibility into individual components for billing and reporting.

Bundles let you sell multiple products together as a single packaged offer while still keeping visibility into the individual components for billing, usage, and reporting. A bundle behaves like a standard rate plan in Zuora, but groups multiple component products and rate plans into a single sellable entity. Bundles have their own pricing and charges, which may differ from the sum of the component prices, and can include optional component charges based on bundle rules.

Note:

This feature is in the Early Availability phase. If you want to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](http://support.zuora.com/?_gl=1*10zsxb8*_gcl_au*MTMyNDgyNzM5My4xNzY0NTY4MTY2*_ga*MTExODk3MDUyNC4xNzY3NzEzNjM2*_ga_MY8CQ650DH*czE3NjgzMTI4NjYkbzEzJGcxJHQxNzY4MzEyODczJGo1MyRsMCRoMTAyODExMTk3NA..).

Bundles help you:

-   Simplify purchasing with one SKU

-   Enforce what must be sold together

-   Support accurate billing and invoicing

-   Attribute revenue back to underlying components


Note:

Bundles define what is sold together. Dynamic pricing determines how much it costs based on context and attributes.
