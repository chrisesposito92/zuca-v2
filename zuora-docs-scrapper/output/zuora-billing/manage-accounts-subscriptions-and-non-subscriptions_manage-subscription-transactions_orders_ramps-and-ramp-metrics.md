# Ramps and Ramp Metrics

This topic explains about creating and managing multi-year ramp deals and reporting Ramp Metrics.

A ramp deal is usually a multi-year deal that increases in price, quantity, or both every year. With the Ramps feature, you can create and manage ramp deals with native Ramps and report out-of-the-box Ramp Metrics.
