# Create a new contact

This task topic explains how to create a new contact by filling in required fields, adding optional details, and ensuring email validity.

To create a new contact:

1.  Enter the required fields, First Name and Last Name, indicated by the green bars next to the fields to set up a new contact.
2.  Fill in the fields as needed for the Bill to Contact. You must also enter a valid email address if you want to send invoices to the customer electronically by email. To ensure the validity of the email address, you must follow the standard format, and it must not contain zero-width characters. For example, the following entries are invalid for an email address: 'tom@', 'tom@website', '@website', and '@website.com'.
3.  Click add more detail to include additional contact information such as fax number and other phone number. These fields are optional.
4.  Fill in the fields as needed for the Sold To Contact. If your Sold To Contact is the same as your Bill To Contact, make sure to select Same as Bill To Contact.
