# Delete uploaded images from HTML templates

Learn how to delete uploaded images from HTML templates without affecting the templates using them.

If an image is no longer used, you can delete it from uploaded images. The deletion of an uploaded image does not impact the templates that are using the image. The reason is that the image is embedded as part of the HTML template.

To delete an upload local image from the HTML template editor through the Zuora UI, perform the following steps:

1.  In the HTML template, click an existing Image block. The Content panel is displayed on the right of the template editor.
2.  In the Images section, click Select image.
3.  In the Select Image dialog that displays all the images uploaded into the HTML template editor, select an image and click Delete to delete the image.
4.  In the HTML template editor, click Save to save the HTML template.
