# Create an electronic non-referenced refund (to refund credit card payment)

Create a non-referenced electronic refund (to refund a credit card payment)

Creating a non-referenced electronic refund (to refund a credit card payment) is similar to the external refund process described in [Create an external non-referenced refund](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/credit-balances/cancel-and-refund-credit-balances/create-an-external-non-referenced-refund).

1.  Navigate to the customer account to which you want to give a refund.
2.  On the customer account detail page, select the Credit Balance tab. Zuora displays the credit balances created for the customer account.
3.  Click Refund Credit Balance. A page opens for you to enter the refund.
4.  For the Refund Type field, select Electronic Refund.
5.  Select a credit card from the Refund Method list.
6.  (Optional): Edit the refund amount. The amount available for refund is displayed by default.
7.  (Optional): Enter a comment.
8.  (Optional): Select a reason code for the refund. Reason codes are a way that you can include additional information or business process context on payment operations transactions. This list contains all of the credit balance refund reason codes that are active in your Zuora tenant.
9.  Click Yes to refund the credit balance.

    When the credit balance is refunded, Zuora changes the refund status to Processed and displays a Refund page that shows the refund number and related information.
