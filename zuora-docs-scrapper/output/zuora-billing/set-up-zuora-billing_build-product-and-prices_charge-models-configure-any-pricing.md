# Charge models - configure any pricing

Zuora Billing enables businesses to tailor their billing systems with diverse pricing models, using charge models as foundational elements for flexible and complex billing structures.

Zuora Billing offers a wide range of pricing models, empowering businesses to customize their billing systems to match their unique product offerings and customer needs.

-   Charge models, which determine how a charge is calculated, serve as both the pricing model for a single charge and the building blocks to provide more pricing flexibility.

-   Pricing models such as Prepaid with Drawdown and Minimum Commitment, use charge models as building blocks to offer more complex and tailored billing structures.
