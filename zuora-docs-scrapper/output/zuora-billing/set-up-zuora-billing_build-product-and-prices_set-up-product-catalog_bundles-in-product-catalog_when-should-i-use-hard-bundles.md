# When should I use Hard Bundles?

This section explains when Hard Bundles are the appropriate choice, helping you determine whether your products, billing requirements, and revenue attribution needs alignment with the Hard Bundle model.

Use bundles when:

-   You want to sell multiple products as one offering

-   Components must be purchased together

-   You need consistent billing and invoicing

-   Revenue must be attributed to underlying components


Do not use bundles if customers must freely add or remove components post-purchase. Consider soft or configurable bundles when available.
