# Use the User Interface to downgrade a product

This topic explains how to downgrade a product by creating a Remove Product amendment followed by an Add Product amendment using the user interface.

To downgrade a product, you must create a Remove Product amendment, then an Add Product amendment. Use the following steps for each product you want to downgrade.

1.  First, Remove a Product using the user interface.
2.  Once the product is removed, follow the Add a Product . Use the same dates as the Remove Product amendment, which makes the new product effective the day that the old product is removed.
