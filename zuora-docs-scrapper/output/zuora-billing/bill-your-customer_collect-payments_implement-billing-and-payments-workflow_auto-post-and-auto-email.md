# Auto-post and auto-email

Learn how to automate your billing process by enabling auto-post and auto-email features after mastering the billing workflow.

When you are very comfortable with the best practice billing workflow process (we recommend approximately 6+ months of billing) and/or have very simple pricing, try the following to further automate your billing process:

1.  Enable the Support bill run auto-post billing rule .
2.  Auto-post invoices upon completion of the bill run
3.  Email invoices after auto-post is complete
