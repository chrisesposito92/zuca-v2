# Get started with Multi-Attribute Pricing charge model for usage charges

Learn how to implement the Multi-Attribute Pricing charge model for usage charges by defining custom fields, using custom objects, and specifying formulas in the product catalog.

Note:

The Multi-Attribute Pricing charge model for one-time and recurring charges is available to all customers.

With the Multi-Attribute Pricing charge model, you can charge your end users based on attributes on the usage record. To achieve this, first define the Usage custom fields that will carry the attribute data, next use a custom object to define the data that will be looked up, and then specify the formula on the charge within the product catalog that will relate the Usage custom field data to the record within the custom object.
