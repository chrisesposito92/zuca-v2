# Cancel a customer account

This task topic explains how to cancel a customer account by first canceling all the associated subscriptions and following the necessary steps in Zuora.

Before you can cancel a customer account, you must [cancel all the subscriptions](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zuora-billing/manage-accounts-subscriptions-and-non-subscriptions/manage-subscription-transactions/subscribe-and-amend/amend-subscriptions/subscriptions-cancelation) associated with that account (you must cancel active and draft subscriptions). When a customer account is canceled, Zuora will not perform any transactions on that account:

-   Zuora will not generate invoices for canceled accounts
-   You cannot apply payments for canceled accounts

To cancel a customer account, complete the following steps:

1.  Navigate to Customers > Customer Accounts in the left-hand navigation.
2.  Locate the customer account that you want to cancel.
3.  Click the name of the customer account to open the account detail page.
4.  Click the three vertical dots icon to show more applicable actions, then click Cancel Customer Account.
5.  Click OK to confirm the action.

If you later want to reactivate the account, click Reactivate Customer Account on the account detail page.
