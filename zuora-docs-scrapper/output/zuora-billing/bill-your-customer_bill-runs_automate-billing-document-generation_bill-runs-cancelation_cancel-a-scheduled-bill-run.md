# Cancel a scheduled bill run

Learn how to cancel a pending scheduled bill run, including options for canceling current or all future recurrences.

To cancel a scheduled bill run that has a status of Pending, complete the following steps:

1.  Navigate to Billing > Bill Runs in the navigation section. All bill runs are listed on the page.
2.  Find the pending bill run that is scheduled to run in the future, and click the Cancel icon on the right side of the row. A dialog is displayed.
3.  Specify whether you want to cancel only the current bill run or cancel all recurring bill runs in the future.

    Note: If you choose to cancel only the current bill run, it will cancel the current bill run and immediately schedule the next recurring bill run. If you choose to cancel all recurring bill runs, it will cancel all future recurrences of the scheduled bill run.

4.  To confirm your selection, click Confirm.

    You can also cancel scheduled bill runs through the [Manage Scheduled Bill Runs](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/bill-runs/automate-billing-document-generation/manage-scheduled-bill-runs) view. Scheduled bill runs in Paused status cannot be canceled.
