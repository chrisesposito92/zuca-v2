# Active subscription cancelation with pending charges

This topic explains about the cancelation of an active subscription with pending charges from the Zuora UI or through the REST API.

Note that if the charge is not active before the cancellation, the charge will be shrunk to the duration of the estimated start date. The effective start date and end date are still blank.
