# Write off debit memos

Know how to write off debit memos

Occasionally, you might want to write off unpaid debit memos or partially paid debit memos when you are sure that the debit memo balance is uncollectible.

A full write-off can be applied to the total remaining balance on the debit memos.

Note:

-   You can write off debit memos only if you have [Invoice Settlement](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-settlement/get-started-with-invoice-settlement/get-started-with-invoice-settlement/invoice-settlement-overview) enabled.

-   This feature is available only if you have enabled the enhanced write-off permission for your tenant. Contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/) to enable this permission.


For specific invoice write-off scenarios, see [here](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-settlement/credit-memos-and-debit-memos/management-of-debit-and-credit-memos/write-off-debit-memos/specific-invoice-write-off-scenarios).
