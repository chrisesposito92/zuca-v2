# View or edit billing attributes of Flexible Billing Attributes feature

Learn how to view or edit billing attributes for subscriptions using the Flexible Billing Attributes feature.

In this use case, assume that you have an initial subscription with billing attributes of the Flexible Billing Attributes feature feature.

To view or edit the billing attributes, perform the following steps:

1.  Navigate to .
2.  On the Subscriptions page, find the subscription that you want to view its details and click its subscription number.
3.  In the Basic Information > Billing & Payment section, find the following billing attributes on the subscription details page.

    -   Bill To Contact

    -   Sold To Contact

    -   Ship To Contact

    -   Currency

    -   Payment Term

    -   Invoice Template ID

    -   Sequence Set ID


4.  Click the edit icon next to Bill To, Sold To, and Ship To fields to edit the bill-to, sold-to, and ship-to contacts.

    Note:

    Before editing the bill-to and sold-to contacts, you need to be aware of the following:

    -   If you edit the bill-to contact, the bill-to contact of the invoice owner account will be updated.
    -   If you edit the sold-to or ship-to contact, the sold-to or ship-to contact of the subscription owner account will be updated.

    In this case, such a change in the invoice and subscription owner accounts will impact other subscriptions under the same account and invoices associated with these subscriptions.
