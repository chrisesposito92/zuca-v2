# Edit a product, rate plan, or product rate plan charge

Learn how edits to products, rate plans, and charges impact existing subscriptions and invoices, including changes to accounting codes.

Edits made to a product, rate plan, product rate plan charge, or product feature affect the existing subscriptions that contain these items. When a product’s accounting code is changed, the changes are reflected in all the existing subscriptions. The updated accounting code is not propagated to the existing invoices; the new invoices will contain the updated accounting code.

Note:

When the Charge Reuse feature is enabled, the change in accounting code is reflected only at the product level. The accounting code changes will not reflect in the existing subscriptions and invoices.

## Edit a product

Navigate to in the left-hand navigation section and open the product detail page. On the product detail page, click Edit in the Product Information section.
