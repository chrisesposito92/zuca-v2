# Generate e-invoice files for billing documents through the Zuora UI

Learn how to generate e-invoice files for invoices using the Zuora UI.

1.  In the left navigation section, navigate to Billing > Invoices.
2.  On the Invoices page, click the number of the invoice that you want to generate an e-invoice file for.
3.  On the invoice details page, click the more options icon, and then click Regenerate E-Invoice.

    An e-invoice file is generated for the invoice. The procedure for generating e-invoice files for credit memos or debit memos is similar to this procedure.
