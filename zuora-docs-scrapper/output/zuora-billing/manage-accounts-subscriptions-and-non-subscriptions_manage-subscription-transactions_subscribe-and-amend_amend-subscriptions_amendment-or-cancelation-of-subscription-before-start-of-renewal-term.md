# Amendment or cancelation of subscription before start of renewal term

This topic guides you through amending or canceling subscriptions before renewal terms, including limitations on usage charges.

Note:

Creating and amending subscriptions in the Zuora Billing UI is only relevant for existing Subscribe and Amend customers who have not transitioned to Orders or Orders Harmonization . Any new customers will not see this UI.

Sometimes, you want to renew your customer subscriptions early and have them pay their annual fee for the renewal term in advance. After receiving their renewal invoice, some customers decide to change or cancel their subscription before the start of the renewal term. In this case, you need to create early renewals or amend or cancel subscriptions before the renewal term starts.
