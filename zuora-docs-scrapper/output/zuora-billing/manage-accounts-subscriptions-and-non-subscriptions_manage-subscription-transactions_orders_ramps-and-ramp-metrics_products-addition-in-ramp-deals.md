# Products addition in ramp deals

This topic guides you through adding a product to a 3-year ramp deal that contains an annual recurring rate plan charge with three Ramp Intervals.

This tutorial demonstrates how to add a product in a ramp deal by creating an order.

-   Interval 1 start date: 2020/07/01, end date: 2021/06/30, charge price: $1000/year

-   Interval 2 start date: 2021/07/01, end date: 2022/06/30, charge price: $1200/year

-   Interval 3 start date: 2022/07/01, end date: 2023/06/30, charge price: $1400/year


The product to add contains an annual recurring per unit charge. The unit price is $30/each and the default quantity is 200.

You will add the new product to Interval 3 of the ramp deal.
