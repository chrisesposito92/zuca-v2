# Per unit pricing

Per unit pricing involves charging a price per unit of a product or service, calculated by multiplying the quantity purchased by the per-unit price.

With the per unit charge model, the amount to charge is expressed as a price per unit. The price is calculated based on the quantity of a service or product purchased by the customer, where the total price charged per period would be the quantity multiplied by the per-unit price. An example of a per unit charge would be a software-as-a-service vendor that charges $50 per user per month for their service.

Per unit pricing can be used with one-time, recurring, or usage charges.
