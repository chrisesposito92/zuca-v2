# Associate order line items with subscriptions

This topic explains about associating order line items with subscriptions using various methods in the Zuora UI.

You can associate order line items with subscriptions using one of the following approaches through the Zuora UI:

-   Create a new subscription and a new order line item and associate them by specifying a unique key in the Unique Key field on the subscription and order line item in the same order.

-   Create a new subscription and a new order line item, edit the subscription name, and associate them by specifying the subscription name in the Subscription Number field on the order line item in the same order.

-   Create a new order line item only and associate it with an existing subscription by specifying the subscription name or number in the Subscription Number on the order line item in an order
