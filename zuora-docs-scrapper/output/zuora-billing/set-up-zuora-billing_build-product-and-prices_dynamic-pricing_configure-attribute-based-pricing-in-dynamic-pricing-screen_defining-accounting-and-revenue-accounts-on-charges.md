# Defining accounting and revenue accounts on charges

Learn how to configure accounting codes and revenue settings for different pricing models in Zuora, ensuring accurate financial reporting and revenue recognition.

When defining pricing for products, whether one-time, recurring, or tiered, you may need to assign accounting codes and configure revenue treatment based on your organization's finance setup. This section explains how to configure Accounting Codes and Zuora Revenue integration settings for each pricing model.

Depending on the features enabled in your Zuora tenant (such as Zuora Finance or Zuora Revenue), the fields available under the Revenue Accounting section may vary.

## Finance Codes

Use these settings to determine how revenue is recognized and reported in Zuora. These settings define the accounting treatment of charges and how journal entries are created.

When defining pricing for products- whether one-time, recurring, or tiered - you may need to assign accounting codes, configure finance codes, and set up revenue treatment based on your organization's finance setup. Accounting codes are used to determine how charges are posted to your general ledger, while finance codes control when and how revenue is recognized and reported. For example, you can specify whether revenue should be recognized daily over the service period, immediately upon invoicing, or deferred and recognized later. Depending on the features enabled in your tenant, additional fields may be available under the Revenue Accounting section. You can also define settings for external revenue recognition, legacy revenue reporting, and mappings that ensure journal entries comply with double-entry accounting rules. Together, accounting, finance, and revenue account configurations provide a consistent way to manage billing, revenue recognition, and financial reporting across your products and charges.
