# Create an electronic non-referenced refund

Electronic non-reference refund

In addition to non-referenced external refunds, Zuora supports non-referenced electronic refunds. Non-referenced electronic refunds issue a credit to a customer electronically, without referencing an existing payment in Zuora.

To offer an example, a non-referenced electronic refund might take place as in the following steps.

1.  A customer prepays for a service, and that payment is applied to a credit balance.
2.  You create an invoice for the customer.
3.  The customer uses some of the credit balance and then asks for a refund of the remaining balance.
4.  You can now create a refund and transfer money to the customer.

    A user's ability to issue refunds is controlled through user permissions under your Administration settings.
