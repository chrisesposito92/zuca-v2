# Check whether an invoice email was sent

Discover how to verify and resend an invoice email if it wasn't received by the customer.

If the email was sent, but your customer still hasn't received it, you can resend it. Perform the following steps to resend an invoice:

Click email invoice on the Invoice Detail page.

Note: You can view both the original and the resending email activities in the History section. For more information see the [View invoice history](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-management/invoice-delivery-preference/view-invoice-history) topic.

If you configure your Bill Run settings to automatically send the email on posting invoices, ensure that the following conditions are taken care:

-   The Work Email address must be provided on the Bill-To Contact.
-   The Communication Profile on the customer account must be set. See View the definition of the selected profile to verify email and notification preferences.
