# Specify Ship To-Contact for an existing customer

This task topic explains how to specify Ship To-Contact for an existing customer.

To specify a Ship-To contact for an existing customer account, perform the following steps:

1.  Navigate to Customers > Customer Accounts in the left-hand navigation section and click the name of the specific customer account you want to update.
2.  Create a Ship-To contact:
    1.  Scroll down to the Contacts section and click Create. The Create Contact dialog opens.
    2.  In the Allowed Contact Types section, select the Ship To checkbox. Only contacts with this checkbox selected can be specified as a Ship To contact.
    3.  Fill in the required information and click Save.
3.  In the Basic Information section on the account detail page, click Edit .
4.  From the Ship To list, select the contact you created in step 2.
5.  Click Save.

When you create a subscription, order line item, or standalone invoice for an account, the account's Ship To contact is automatically set as the default Ship-To contact for the subscription, order line item, or standalone invoice. However, you can update the Ship-To contact afterwards if needed. See Specify ship-to contacts for subscriptions, order line items, and standalone invoices.
