# Charge billing period is the same as discount duration

If the charge billing period matches the discount duration, explore the related use cases for alignment and discount scenarios.

If your charge billing period is the same as the discount duration, refer to the following use cases.

-   [Start dates of charge and discount are aligned, fixed amount discount](/zuora-billing/set-up-zuora-billing/build-product-and-prices/charge-models---configure-any-pricing/discount-pricing/enhanced-discount-use-cases/use-case-2.1-start-dates-of-charge-and-discount-are-aligned-fixed-amount-discount)

-   [Start dates of charge and discount are not aligned](/zuora-billing/set-up-zuora-billing/build-product-and-prices/charge-models---configure-any-pricing/discount-pricing/enhanced-discount-use-cases/use-case-2.2-start-dates-of-charge-and-discount-are-not-aligned)

-   [Start dates of charge and discount are not aligned, fixed amount discount billing period is smaller than charge billing period](/zuora-billing/set-up-zuora-billing/build-product-and-prices/charge-models---configure-any-pricing/discount-pricing/enhanced-discount-use-cases/use-case-2.3-start-dates-of-charge-and-discount-are-not-aligned-fixed-amount-discount-billing-period-is-smaller-than-charge-billing-period)
