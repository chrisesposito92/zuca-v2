# Default reason code and deactivate reason codes for orders

This topic explains how to set a reason code as the default and how to deactivate existing reason codes for orders.

## Set one existing reason code as the default reason code

If Make Default does not display in the Actions column for a reason code row but "Default" in black displays, this indicates that the reason code in this row is the default reason code.

To set another reason code as default, click Make Default in the reason code row that you want to set as default.

## Deactivate the existing reason codes

To deactivate an existing reason code, click Deactivate in the reason code row that you want to deactivate.

If the check mark in the Active column for the reason code row disappears, it indicates that the reason code is deactivated. You can reactivate the reason code by clicking Activate later.
