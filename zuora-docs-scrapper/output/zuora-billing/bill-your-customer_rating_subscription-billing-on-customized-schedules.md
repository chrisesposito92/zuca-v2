# Subscription billing on customized schedules

Learn how to bill subscriptions on customized schedules and automatically generate invoices based on configured invoice schedules.

Without the Billing Schedule feature, you have to use the standard billing process to bill customers with fixed amounts based on a regular billing period, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually. With this feature, you can bill subscriptions on customized schedules instead of regular schedules, and then automatically generate invoices for the subscriptions based on configured invoice schedules.

For more information, see Billing Schedule.
