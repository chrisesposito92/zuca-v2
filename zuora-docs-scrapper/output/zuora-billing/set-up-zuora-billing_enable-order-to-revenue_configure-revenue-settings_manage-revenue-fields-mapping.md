# Manage revenue fields mapping

Learn how to manage field mappings for the Order to Revenue feature, including viewing, adding, and updating mappings, as well as downloading a CSV file.

On the Manage Revenue Fields Mapping page, you can do the following for the Order to Revenue feature:

-   View the field mapping for standard and custom fields

-   Add or update the field mapping for custom fields

-   View the changelog for adding or updating custom field mapping

-   Download a CSV file that includes all the field mapping


Note:

-   Revenue standard field mapping for the FV\_ELIGIBLE\_FLAG field is available.

-   You can now map an invoice number to Revenue when creating memo items, as long as the memo originates from the invoice in the field mapping.
