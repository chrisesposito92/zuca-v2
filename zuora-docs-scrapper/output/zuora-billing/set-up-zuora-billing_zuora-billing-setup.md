# Zuora Billing setup

This section introduces the key Zuora Billing configurations required for effective management of products, pricing, taxes, and billing operations.

Before processing transactions, it is important to review and set up the configurations that define how products and prices are structured, how taxes are applied, and how billing documents are generated. These setup areas ensure that your billing environment runs smoothly and remains compliant.

You will begin by creating products and pricing in the product catalog, where you can define offerings, subscription features, and pricing models, including attribute-based pricing. From there, you can adjust billing settings, which come with default values but can be customized by administrators to fit your organization’s needs.

For taxation, Zuora provides several options: Zuora Tax, Configurable Tax apps, Direct Avalara Integration, and custom workarounds. Accurate tax setup requires valid customer account data, including country and state/province details for U.S. and Canadian accounts.

Finally, you can enable Order to Revenue, Zuora’s end-to-end solution that unifies quotes, orders, billing, payments, collections, and revenue recognition. This modern solution replaces the legacy Billing–Revenue Integration and ensures a single source of truth across applications.

Together, these configurations prepare your Zuora Billing environment to support accurate, compliant, and efficient billing operations.
