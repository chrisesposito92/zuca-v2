# Invoices write off from the UI

Learn how to write off unpaid invoices in Posted status using the Zuora UI or REST API, with automatic rollback in case of exceptions.

You can write off unpaid invoices in Posted status with the Zuora UI or REST API. If any exception occurs during invoice write-off, the operation will roll back.

To write off a posted invoice through the REST API, see [PUT Write off invoice](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/PUT_WriteOffInvoice) for more information.
