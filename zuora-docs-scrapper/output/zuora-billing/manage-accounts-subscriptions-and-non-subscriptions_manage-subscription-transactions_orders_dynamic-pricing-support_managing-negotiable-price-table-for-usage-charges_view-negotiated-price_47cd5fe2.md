# View Negotiated Price table in the Subscriptions UI

This task topic allows you to view the latest Dynamic Pricing Decision Table for the usage charge that represents the latest effective pricing based on the negotiated price.

1.  Log in to the Zuora application and navigate to Orders > Subscription details page. The Subscription details page opens.
2.  Access the Included Products section and expand the usage charge.

    1.  Note:

        If a negotiated price exists, the Charge Details section includes a Dynamic Pricing Decision Table field with a View link.

        Click the View link to view the latest Dynamic Pricing Decision Table for the usage charge that represents the latest effective pricing based on the negotiated price. When a usage charge is processed, this price table is used to evaluate its price.

    Note:

    If a negotiated price does not exist for that charge, the Dynamic Pricing Decision Table field will not be displayed, you can refer to the standard price table in the product catalog.
