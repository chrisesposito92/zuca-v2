# Retrieve e-invoicing results

Understand how to retrieve e-invoice results using the billing document ID, including specific fields for Italy.

You can use the Retrieve e-invoicing results operation to retrieve e-invoice results according to the ID of a billing document. The document ID can be the ID of an invoice, a credit memo, or a debit memo.

The e-invoicing result fields might be different by country.

The e-invoicing result fields on `EInvoiceData` include the following fields for Italy:

-   `QrCode`: This field is empty for Italy.

-   `ReferenceNumber`: This field stores a unique number generated by the tax authority. In Italy, it is a unique identifier assigned to each electronically submitted invoice by the Italy tax authority, known as [Agenzia delle Entrate](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/). The information is obtained from the `IdentificativoSdI` field in the cleared document.

-   `DocumentId`: This field stores the ID of the billing document, for which the e-invoice file is generated.

-   `DocumentType`: This field indicates the type of the billing document, for which the e-invoice file is generated.


The `eInvoiceFileId` field on the `Invoice` object stores the ID of the Base64-encoded e-invoice file, a cleared document in the format of FatturaPA (XML).
