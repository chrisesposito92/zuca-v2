# Usage for customer accounts

This topic explains how to view and manage usage information for customer accounts, including aggregating data from child accounts and handling large volumes of usage records.

## Overview

View usage information for the selected customer account.

## Aggregating Usage from Child Accounts

Select Include usage belonging to all child accounts of this customer account to collect usage information from all child accounts into this view.

## Large Volumes of Usage Records

When viewing a customer account, the usage records are loaded separately from the other account information on the page. This ensures that the page is displayed quickly, even if the customer has a large amount of recorded usage data.

If the usage records take longer than 2 minutes to load, the following message is displayed: `There are too many usage records to display. Click view all to see the usage records.` If you see this message, click the view all button to view all the customer's usage records.
