# Bulk PDF files export

The Bulk Legal Document Generation System efficiently generates bulk PDF files for legal documents, focusing on invoices, credit memos, and debit memos, ensuring scalability and performance.

The Bulk Legal Document Generation System aims to design and implement a solution that efficiently generates bulk PDF files for legal documents specifically focusing on invoices, credit memos, and debit memos. The system is designed to handle a high volume of document generation requests ensuring scalability, performance, and ease of use.

Note: Note that the export feature is designed to export invoices created manually by users. It will not include invoices that are automatically generated by the system, such as those created after a payment is processed. For a complete and comprehensive export that contains all invoices (both user-created and system-generated), you must use the newer Data Export tool. For more information, see Data Exports.

For sample requests and responses from the background job that helps export PDFs, see the Export bulk PDF files operation .
