# Total Contract Value

Total Contract Value (TCV) represents the value of one-time and recurring charges, excluding usage charges, and is useful for planning expenditure and managing business growth.

Total Contract Value (TCV) is a metric that represents the value of one-time and recurring charges. It does not include usage charges. TCV is a projection of your booking revenue and can be useful when planning expenditure and managing the growth of your business. See Exporting TCV data for analysis for more information.

TCV is the measure of the value a customer has committed to you in contracts or orders. It does not match the total invoice amounts that are billed for charges over the subscription term. For Order TCV, see Key Metrics for Orders .
