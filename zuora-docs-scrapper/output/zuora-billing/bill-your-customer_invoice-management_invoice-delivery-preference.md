# Invoice delivery preference

This section explains how invoices can be delivered based on customer preferences, including Print and Email methods.

Invoices can be delivered based on your customers' preference for receiving their invoices. The invoice delivery preference setting in the customer account determines the invoice delivery method. The available methods are Print and Email. The Print method indicates you need to download the invoice PDF and send your customers a hard copy. The Email method indicates the invoice is sent to your customer via email.
