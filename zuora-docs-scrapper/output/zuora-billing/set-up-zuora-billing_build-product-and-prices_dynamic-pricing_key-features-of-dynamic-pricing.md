# Key features of dynamic pricing

Dynamic pricing offers attribute-driven pricing, rate cards, pricing expressions, effective dating, min/max pricing rules, and support for negotiated pricing to simplify catalog management and align pricing strategies with business goals.

The key features of dynamic pricing are:

-   Attribute-driven pricing: Dynamically determine prices using attributes such as age, location, ARR, and more.

-   Rate Cards (Pricing Table): Define pricing matrices based on attribute combinations. Rate cards can be applied to One-Time, Recurring, or Usage charges across standard charge models, including Flat Fee, Per Unit, Tiered, Volume, and Overage.

-   Pricing Expressions: Apply mathematical formulas or conditional logic to support more complex pricing strategies, such as volume-based discounts or context-specific surcharges.

-   Effective Dating: Support for time-based price changes using UTC datetime stamps.

-   Min/Max Pricing Rules: Set bounds at the rate card or tier level to control final charge amounts.

-   Support for Negotiated Pricing: Personalized pricing can be defined per customer using hierarchical lookup rules.


These capabilities help you simplify catalog management by avoiding an overload of product variations. Instead of creating multiple SKUs for every region, customer type, or pricing scenario, you can define rules once and let the system apply them intelligently. This gives you a scalable way to deliver the right price at the right time, while aligning pricing strategies with business goals such as revenue growth, churn reduction, or market expansion.
