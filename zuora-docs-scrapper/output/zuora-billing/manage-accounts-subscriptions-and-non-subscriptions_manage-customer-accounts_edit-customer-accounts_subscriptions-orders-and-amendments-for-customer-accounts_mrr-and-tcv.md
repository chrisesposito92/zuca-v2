# MRR and TCV

This topic refers to the explains about MRR and TCV.

The monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is a key metric for subscription businesses and represents the Monthly Recurring Revenue for a subscription, order, or charge. The MRR calculates subscription fees normalized to a monthly value, and does not include one-time or usage fees. See Monthly Recurring Revenue for more information about MRR.

TCV is the amount of revenue that a subscription generates in its first term, assuming the subscription is not yet renewed. The first term, also known as the *initial term*, and TCV do not define the billing period of the subscription. However, the initial term can have an effect on invoicing if your customer does not renew the subscription is not renewed and you try to invoice your customer past the subscription's first term.
