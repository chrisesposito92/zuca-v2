# Considerations - Amend or cancel subscriptions

This topic explains about the restrictions on canceling or amending subscriptions with usage charges before the last invoice date.

## Considerations

Currently, you cannot make cancelations or amendments that affect usage charges before the last invoice date. Therefore, you cannot perform the following cancelations and amendments with an effective date before the last invoice date:

-   Cancel a subscription that has a usage charge.

-   Create a Remove a Product amendment to remove a product that has a usage charge.

-   Create an Update a Product amendment to update a usage charge.


However, you can create an Add a Product amendment to add a product that has a usage charge before the last invoice date.
