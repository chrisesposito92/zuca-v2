# Flexible Tax Mapping

This section covers information on override built-in tax mapping rules in Zuora to customize data storage according to your business needs.

When supported tax apps and vendors complete tax calculations and send back the results, Zuora stores the returned values in the database with a built-in rule for mapping fields. With Flexible Tax Mapping, you can override the built-in mapping rule to select and store the data that best suits your business needs.
