# Owners of subscriptions changes

This topic guides you through changing the owner of a subscription by creating an order and transferring the subscription and invoices to the same account.

This tutorial demonstrates how to change the owner of a subscription by creating an order. You will transfer the subscription and invoices to the same account.

In this tutorial, you will set the following dates to today's date:

-   The date when the order is signed

-   The contract effective date of the transfer

-   The service activation date of the transfer

-   The customer acceptance date of the transfer


To activate the Owner Transfer order action through the self-serve interface, see Feature Management.
