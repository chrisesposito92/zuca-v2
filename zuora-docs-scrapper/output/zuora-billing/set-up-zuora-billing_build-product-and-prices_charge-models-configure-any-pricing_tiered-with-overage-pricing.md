# Tiered with overage pricing

The tiered with overage pricing model includes an additional charge for usage exceeding the final tier's limit.

The tiered with overage charge model applies only to usage-based charges. This charge model is similar to the tiered charge model, except there is an overage charge for any units consumed above the ending units of the final tier.
