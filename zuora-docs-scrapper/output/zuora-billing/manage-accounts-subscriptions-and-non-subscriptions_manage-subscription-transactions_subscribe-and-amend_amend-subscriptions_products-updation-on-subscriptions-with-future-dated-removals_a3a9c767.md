# APIs - update a product with future-dated Remove Product amendments

This topic explains about using the Zuora SOAP and REST APIs to update products on subscriptions with future-dated amendments.

## Using the Zuora APIs

You can use Zuora SOAP API and REST API to update a product even when future-dated Remove Product amendments already exist on the subscription:

-   For SOAP API, see the Updating a Product use case and follow the instructions based on your WSDL version.

-   For REST API, use the Update subscription method.


See Using the Zuora API to Update a Product for more information.
