# Terms and conditions of ramp deals changes

This tutorial guides you through changing the terms and conditions of a ramp deal by extending its duration and updating the ramp intervals.

This tutorial demonstrates how to change a ramp deal's Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) and update the ramp by creating an order.

In this tutorial, you will extend the term of a 3-year ramp deal to 4 years and update the Ramp to include the fourth year as Interval 4. The original ramp deal contains an annual recurring rate plan charge with different a price for each of its three Ramp Intervals.

-   Interval 1 start date: 2020/07/01, end date: 2021/06/30, charge price: $1000/year

-   Interval 2 start date: 2021/07/01, end date: 2022/06/30, charge price: $1200/year

-   Interval 3 start date: 2022/07/01, end date: 2023/06/30, charge price: $1400/year


The new interval to add is Interval 4: start date: 2022/07/01, end date: 2024/06/30, charge price: $1400/year.
