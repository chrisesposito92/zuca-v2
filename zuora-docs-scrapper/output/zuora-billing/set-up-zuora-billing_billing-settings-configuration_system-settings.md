# System settings

System settings influence billing and overall system functionality, including feature toggling and customization of currencies and units of measure.

System settings not only apply to the billing process but can also impact the whole system. For example, you can use system settings to enable or disable specific features for your environment, or you can customize currencies or the units of measure (UOM) in the system.
