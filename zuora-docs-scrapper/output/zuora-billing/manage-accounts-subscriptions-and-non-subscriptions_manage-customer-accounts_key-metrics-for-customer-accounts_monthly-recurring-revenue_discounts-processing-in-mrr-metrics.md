# Discounts processing in MRR metrics

This topic explains how discounts are processed in MRR calculations, highlighting the differences from invoicing and detailing the types of discount charges supported.

This section introduces how discounts are processed in the MRR calculation and why it is different from that in Invoicing.

Zuora applies discounts as charges. Two types of discount charges are supported: fixed-amount discounts and percentage discounts. A discount charge can be restricted to a regular rate plan charge, a rate plan, a subscription, or an account. See more information in Discount charge models.

Note: The

Orders

feature does not support account level discounts.
