# Create a product rate plan charge (PRPC)

Learn how to create a product rate plan charge (PRPC) with attribute-based pricing (ABP) and set a base price for non-ABP charges.

With the new catalog, you can define attribute-based pricing (ABP) for charges, along with the ability to set a base price.

## Base price

Set the default price of the PRPC without attributes (i.e., non-ABP charges).
