# Create a credit balance by transferring a negative invoice balance

Create a credit balance using a negative invoice balance

A negative invoice amount represents money that you owe the customer. You can transfer a negative invoice amount to a credit balance. Typically, you transfer the full negative invoice amount to the credit balance to close out a negative invoice. Subsequently, you can apply the credit balance toward a future invoice.

The following default values are used when transferring a negative invoice balance:

-   The full invoice balance is used as the default value.

-   The amount available for transfer is the invoice balance.

-   The transfer uses the current date.


To create a credit balance using a negative invoice balance, complete the following steps:

1.  Navigate to Billing > Invoices to find the target invoice with a negative balance.
2.  Click the invoice number to open the invoice details page, click the three vertical dots icon to see more applicable actions, and then click Transfer to Credit Balance.
3.  In the Amount to Transfer field, specify the amount to be transferred, then click Transfer To Credit Balance . A confirmation dialog indicates you are transferring the specified amount to the credit balance.
4.  Click Yes to confirm the transfer.
