# What attributes do?

Context Attributes are essential components of Adaptive Context, enabling dynamic rules and consistent execution in pricing and packaging decisions.

Context Attributes are the building blocks of Adaptive Context. They represent data points that can be referenced in dynamic rules, API responses, or UI rendering logic. Attributes may come from:

-   Zuora objects, for example, Account, Subscription, Product Rate Plan

-   Custom objects, for example, customer metadata, usage summaries

-   External systems, for example, CRM, marketing platform, or user sessions


By defining attributes once, you can reuse them across Business Context Rules, ensuring consistency and agility in the execution of pricing and packaging decisions.
