# Biling Rules - Discount

The Discount section outlines billing rules for discount configurations, including options for handling stacked percentage discounts.

The Discount section contains billing rules specific to discount configurations.

## Should the stacked percentage discount ignore or follow discount class

Select whether to ignore the discount class when applying stacked percentage discounts:

-   The default Ignore discount class option maintains the current behavior of ignoring the discount class order when applying stacked discounts.

-   The Follow discount class option switches the behavior to applying the stacked discounts in the discount class order and applying the stacked discount to the remaining amount after the previous discount class is processed.
