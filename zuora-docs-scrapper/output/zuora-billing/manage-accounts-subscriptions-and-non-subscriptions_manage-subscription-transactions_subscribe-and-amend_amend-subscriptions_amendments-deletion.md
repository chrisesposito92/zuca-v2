# Amendments deletion

This topic explains about deleting amendments in the Zuora Billing UI, applicable to specific customer scenarios.

Note:

Creating and amending subscriptions in the Zuora Billing UI is only relevant for existing Subscribe and Amend customers who have not transitioned to Orders or Orders Harmonization . Any new customers will not see this UI.

You can delete an amendment only if an invoice has not been generated for the subscription. One exception to this rule is auto-renew amendments. You can delete the last auto-renew amendment even if an invoice has been generated.
