# Orders

This topic explains about creating and managing orders, including subscriptions, amendments, and order line items, to support various business models.

Orders are contractual agreements between merchants and customers. You can create multiple subscriptions and subscription amendments at once in a single order. All the operations on subscriptions in orders are done by order actions. You can also create order line items to support your non-subscription based business models. Zuora calculates order delta metrics when orders take place. You can retrieve order delta metrics and measure billed and unbilled amounts by order.

The Orders tenant can be identified directly from the tabs listed under the Customers tab.
