# Standard objects

Explore the data schema tree to access all objects and fields, ensuring they are available for use in HTML templates.

Users have the ability to navigate through invoice/credit memo/debit memo to access all objects and fields in the data schema tree. If an object or field is absent from the data schema tree, it cannot be utilized in the HTML template.
