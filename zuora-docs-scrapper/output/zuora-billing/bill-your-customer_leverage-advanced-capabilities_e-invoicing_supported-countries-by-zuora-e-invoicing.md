# Supported countries by Zuora e-invoicing

Zuora's E-Invoice Connector supports countries covered by Avalara ELR and Sovos, detailing mandates, e-invoice models, and mandate dates.

The Zuora E-Invoice Connector supports all countries covered by Avalara ELR (E-Invoicing and Live Reporting) and Sovos. This page lists the supported countries along with their mandates, e-invoice models, and mandate dates.

Note: Zuora updates this page based on the public documentation provided by Avalara and Sovos.

The E-Invoicing model supports both PEPPOL Network and Non-PEPPOL Network connections:

-   PEPPOL Network: A standardized European e-invoicing and procurement network.

-   Non-PEPPOL Network: Includes Continuous Transaction Control (CTC) models, such as:

    -   CTC Clearance (For example, Mexico, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Italy) – requires invoices to be cleared in real time by a central authority before they are considered valid.

    -   CTC E-Reporting – requires reporting invoices to a central authority, but without real-time clearance.


Note:

-   The table on this page may not reflect Avalara ELR or Sovos updates in real time.
-   If you need confirmation for a specific country that is not listed here, contact Avalara or Sovos directly.
