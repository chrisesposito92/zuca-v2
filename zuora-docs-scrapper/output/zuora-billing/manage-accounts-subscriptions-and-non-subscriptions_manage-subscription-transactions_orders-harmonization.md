# Orders Harmonization

This topic explains how Orders Harmonization facilitates the transition from Subscribe and Amend to Orders, enabling access to major functions and configurations.

If you are an existing Subscribe and Amend customer, and want to adopt Orders and all the features that require Orders, Orders Harmonization helps you to transition to Orders easily.

The tenant type can be identified directly from the tabs listed under the Customers tab.

| Orders | Subscribe and Amend | Orders Harmonization |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

You can access major functions of Subscribe and Amend tenant and Orders tenant in your Orders Harmonization tenant. For configurations in Subscribe and Amend tenant and Orders tenant, see Subscribe and Amend and Orders , respectively.
