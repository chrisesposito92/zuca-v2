# Invoice attachment management

Learn how to manage attachments in Zuora to associate documents with invoices and other records, including credit memos and subscriptions.

Use attachments in Zuora to upload documents of various formats to associate additional information with accounts, subscriptions, invoices, credit memos, or debit memos. Example attachments could be purchase orders (PO's), tax exemption documents, or ownership transfer forms. Credit memos or debit memos are available if you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled.

You can upload any number of attachments for each supported Zuora record, up to the value set by the Maximum number of attachments per record field in tenant profile.

An attachment can belong to only one Zuora record, such as a specific invoice, a credit memo, a debit memo, a subscription, or a customer account.

For subscriptions, an attachment is tied to all versions of the subscription via the Subscription Number.

See Attachments for managing attachments with Zuora REST API.
