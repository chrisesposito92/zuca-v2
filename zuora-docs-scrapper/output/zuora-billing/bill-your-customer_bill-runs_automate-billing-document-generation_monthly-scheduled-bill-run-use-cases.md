# Monthly scheduled bill run use cases

Explore how to schedule monthly bill runs on specific days or at the end of each month, with options for recurring invoice and target dates.

For monthly scheduled bill runs, you can schedule the bill runs to be executed on a specific day of a month or always executed on the end day of each month.

For monthly scheduled bill runs, when you specify the Invoice Date or Target Date field as the end day of a month, you can schedule the invoice or target dates recur in one of the following ways:

-   Recur before or after a fixed number of days from the bill run dates.

-   Recur before or after a fixed number of months from the bill run dates, and the day value is a day of the month (for example, 29) specified in the Invoice Date or Target Date field.

-   Recur before or after a fixed number of months from the bill run dates, and the day value is the end day of the month.
