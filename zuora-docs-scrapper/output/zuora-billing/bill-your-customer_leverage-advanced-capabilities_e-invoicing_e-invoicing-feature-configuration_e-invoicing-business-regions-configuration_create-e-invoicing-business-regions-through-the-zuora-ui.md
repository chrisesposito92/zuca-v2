# Create e-invoicing business regions through the Zuora UI

Learn how to configure and create e-invoicing business regions using the Zuora UI to ensure accurate billing submissions.

Ensure that you configure the correct business region. If more than one business region is matched when submitting the billing document, the system blocks the submission with an error message.

To create a business region for your e-invoicing service provider through the Zuora UI, perform the following steps:

1.  Click your avatar in the upper right and click .
2.  On the Billing Settings page, click E-Invoice.
3.  On the E-Invoice Settings page, click \+ Add in the Business Regions section.
4.  In the displayed Add Business Region dialog, configure the business region settings, and then click Save to save the settings.

An e-invoicing business region is created.
