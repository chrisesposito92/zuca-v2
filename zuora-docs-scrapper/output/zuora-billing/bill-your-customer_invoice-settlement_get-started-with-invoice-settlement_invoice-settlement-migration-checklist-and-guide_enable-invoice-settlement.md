# Enable Invoice Settlement

Learn how to enable the Invoice Settlement feature.

1.  Check the known limitations of the Invoice Settlement feature. See [Known limitations](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-settlement/get-started-with-invoice-settlement/known-limitations-in-invoice-settlement) in Invoice Settlement for more information.
2.  Submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/) to assess whether existing features in the Production environment are compatible with Invoice Settlement. To enable this feature, it is best practice to inform us at least seven days in advance to complete the migration. How long the migration takes depends on the tenant data, which might be longer or less than seven days.
3.  See [API integration](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-settlement/get-started-with-invoice-settlement/invoice-settlement-migration-checklist-and-guide/api-integration) and [Billing configurations](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-settlement/get-started-with-invoice-settlement/invoice-settlement-migration-checklist-and-guide/billing-configurations) to make changes to the integration.
4.  Go through the migration checklist and perform the corresponding actions. See [Migration checklist and required actions](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/invoice-settlement/get-started-with-invoice-settlement/invoice-settlement-migration-checklist-and-guide#concept-54setuxb__section-383) for more information.
5.  Complete the items given in the checklist and contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/) for the feature enablement.
