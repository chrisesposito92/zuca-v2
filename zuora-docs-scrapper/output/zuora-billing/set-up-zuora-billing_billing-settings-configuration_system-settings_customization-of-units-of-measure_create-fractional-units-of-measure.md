# Create fractional units of measure

Learn how to create fractional units of measure by configuring decimal places and rounding options.

To create fractional units of measure, complete the following steps:

1.  Click your username at the top right and navigate to​​​​​​ Billing > Customize Units of Measure .
2.  On the Customize Unit of Measures page, click Add New UOM .
3.  Specify information about the UOM. Use the Decimal Places and Rounding field to configure the UOM as a fractional measure.

    -   Decimal Places : Enter the number of decimal places required for the fraction.

    -   Rounding : Select the rounding option that you want to use, `Up` or `Down` , if the fraction exceeds the specified number of decimal places.


4.  Click S ave .

You cannot edit the Decimal Places field after saving the new unit of measure. This prevents users from making changes to subscriptions that use the unit of measure.
