# Update the trigger condition for subscription rate plan charges

This article explains how to update the trigger condition for a subscription rate plan charge without creating an amendment, unless it has been invoiced.

You can directly update the trigger condition for a rate plan charge in a subscription without creating a Terms and Conditions amendment (or order action) for the subscription.

Note:

You cannot perform this operation if the subscription rate plan charge has already been invoiced.
