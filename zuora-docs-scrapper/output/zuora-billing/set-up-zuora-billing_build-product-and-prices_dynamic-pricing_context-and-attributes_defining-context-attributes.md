# Defining context attributes

The Context&Attributes screen allows you to define attributes for use in dynamic pricing, promotions, real-time personalization, and product catalogue targeting, enabling intelligent control over packaging, pricing, and merchandising strategies.

The Context & Attributes screen is where you define these attributes. Once created, they can be used across:

-   Dynamic Pricing

-   Promotions and Offers

-   Real-time Personalization

-   Product Catalogue targeting


By defining context attributes, you can:

-   Capture data from sessions, users, or external sources

-   Enable real-time evaluation of conditions during API calls or UI rendering

-   Power conditional logic in Business Context Rules (like Promotions, Pricing Plans, Merchandising).


Together, these capabilities transform your Product Catalogue into an intelligent control layer for packaging, pricing, and merchandising strategies.
