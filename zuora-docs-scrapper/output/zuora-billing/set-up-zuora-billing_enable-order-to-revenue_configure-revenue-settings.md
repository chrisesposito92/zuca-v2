# Configure revenue settings

Introduces various configurations that you can do on the Revenue Settings page.

When you first start using Order to Revenue, many configuration settings are pre-populated with common default values. Users with administrative privileges can tailor these out-of-the-box values to custom settings that will work better for their organizations.

To access your tenant's settings for Order to Revenue, click your username at the upper right and then click Revenue . The Revenue Settings page opens, listing all applicable configuration settings.

Note:

The Order to Revenue feature is now generally available.

Previously, only new Zuora customers and existing Zuora Billing customers had access to this feature. Zuora Billing-Revenue Integration customers can now migrate to the Order to Revenue feature.

The Order to Revenue feature is the new solution that enables a single source of truth across Zuora applications. The previous solution, Zuora Billing - Revenue Integration, is no longer available to new Zuora customers as of October 1, 2023.
