# Context and attributes

Helps you to enable dynamic product catalog and pricing logic by synthesizing real-time signals to drive immediate business actions.

Adaptive Context is the dynamic foundation that enables your product catalogue and pricing logic to respond intelligently to real-world conditions. It acts as a *decision layer* that synthesizes real-time signals from across your ecosystem, such as your billing data, CRM, customer activity, and product configurations, and translates those signals into immediate business actions. Adaptive Context dynamically controls:

-   What products are shown to whom

-   Which pricing rules apply

-   When specific features or promotions are activated


Instead of creating multiple product versions or hardcoding business logic, you can dynamically shape your offerings using a consistent set of context attributes.
