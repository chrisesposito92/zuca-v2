# Selecting Products and Rate Plans

In this article, you can learn how to efficiently select products and rate plans using Zuora Billing's type ahead feature, which allows you to search by entering at least three characters of the product or rate plan name.

When selecting a product and rate plan to add to your subscription, Zuora Billing displays up to 15 products and rate plans in the list. If your company has more than 15 products or rate plans, you can easily search for your desired product or rate by using our type ahead feature. Using type ahead, enter at least three characters contained in the product or rate plan name you want to search for in the Product or Rate Plan field. Zuora Billing will display all products and rate plans that match.

1.  To search for a product, begin by typing in the full or partial name of the product and select the desired product from the Product list. When typing in the partial product name, enter at least three characters contained in the name of the product you want to add, and Zuora Billing will display all products that match.
2.  After you select the product, Zuora Billing will display a list of available rate plans for such product. Select the rate plan that you want to add from the Rate Plan list. If your rate plan is not listed, search for the rate plan using our type ahead feature: enter the partial product or rate plan name (enter at least three letters of the name) and Zuora Billing will display all the rate plans that match.
