# Country-specific configurations in Sovos for Poland

This topic describes the mandatory e-invoicing requirements in Poland and the related configuration in Sovos, including support for the KSeF 2.0 platform.

Poland is introducing a mandatory Continuous Transaction Controls (CTC) clearance model through the national platform, Krajowy System e-Faktur (KSeF), under the KSeF 2.0 framework. Under this model, all B2B invoices are centrally submitted to and validated by the Polish tax authority.

Invoices must be transmitted to KSeF in the proprietary FA(3) XML format. An invoice becomes legally valid only after it is successfully validated by KSeF and assigned a unique KSeF ID.

Note:

This obligation applies to all VAT-registered taxpayers in Poland.
