# Custom fields on rate plans

Learn how to use custom fields on rate plans to manage logic patterns and match discount codes in your product catalog.

You can use custom fields on rate plans to manage your logic patterns, to support your logic for acceptable rate plan pairings.

A popular way to do this is to assign a CODE to the rate plan description, which allows you to match a discount code provided by a user via web session to that unique discount rate plan in your product catalog.

## What's next

After a rate plan is added for a product, you can then create rate plan charges for the product rate plan. A product rate plan charge represents the charge model or a set of fees associated with the product rate plan. Each product rate plan can have multiple rate plan charges based on different charge models.
