# Predefined data tables for billing documents

Explore predefined data tables and components for billing documents, including invoices, credit memos, and debit memos, within the HTML template editor.

The online HTML template editor provides sample table components in the Content tab, containing predefined data tables with predefined table configurations and common merge fields.

-   For invoices: Charge Details , Tax Summary , Transactions , and Usage Details components

-   For credit memos: Credit Memo Details and Tax Summary components

-   For debit memos: Debit Memo Details , Tax Summary , and Transactions components


To configure data tables, drag any sample table components with predefined data into an HTML template and adjust them as needed. For example, after clicking the table displayed in the HTML template, you can make updates in the Columns section of the displayed Content tab:

-   Click the Edit icon in the corresponding row to update the name of column headers and the width and alignment of each column.

-   Edit columns or rows by directly clicking on them. Modify the details as required. The changes are reflected in real-time within the column.

-   Use the Action checkbox in the corresponding row to determine whether a column is displayed in HTML templates.


In HTML templates, you can also configure data tables from scratch. To learn more about customizing data tables, see Configure data tables in HTML templates.
