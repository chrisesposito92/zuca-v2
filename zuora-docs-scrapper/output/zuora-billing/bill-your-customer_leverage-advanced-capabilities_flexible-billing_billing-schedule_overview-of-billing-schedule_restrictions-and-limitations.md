# Restrictions and limitations

Explore the restrictions and limitations of the Billing Schedule feature, including supported charge types, discount models, and order actions.

When using the Billing Schedule feature, keep the following restrictions and limitations in mind:

| Item | Restrictions and limitations |
| --- | --- |
| Charge types | Only one-time or recurring charges are supported. Recurring charges with the Delivery Pricing charge model are not supported.The Billing Schedule feature requires that one-time charges be credited back if they are removed or canceled. If you set the Enable credit back for removing or canceling one-time charge billing rule to No , you cannot remove or cancel one-time charges.However, if you want not to provide credit for one-time charges after they are billed, you can first set the billing rule to Yes as an alternative option. Then, in this case, you have to write off the corresponding credit memo. |
| Discount charge models | Both one-time and recurring charges with the Discount - Percentage charge model are supported. The Discount - Fixed Amount charge model is not supported.The discount support applies to both rate plan and subscription levels, while account-level discounts are not supported. |
| Charge settings | For the charges in orders, you must configure the following settings:Set Billing Cycle Type to Charge Trigger Day, Term Start Date, or Term End Date appropriately.Set Billing Period Alignment to Align to Charge, Align to Term Start Date, or Align Term End Date appropriately.If you set Billing Cycle Type to Term Start Date or Term End Date for charges, you cannot change the term start date and term end date for the current term after creating the corresponding invoice schedule. |
| Orders | Only termed subscriptions are supported.Orders with evergreen subscriptions are not supported.Orders with usage charges and order line items are supported, but usage charges and order line items are automatically excluded from invoice schedules. |
| Orders Harmonization | With the Orders Harmonization feature, you can create orders through Orders API operations, and create invoice schedules for orders through the REST API, and change subscriptions through the Amendment UI, the Amend action, or Orders API operations. The Orders UI is not available. |
| Subscriptions | If you use the Flexible Billing Attributes feature, subscriptions associated with an invoice schedule must have the same billing attributes including bill-to contacts, payment terms, invoice templates, and sequence sets. For more information about the Flexible Billing Attributes feature, see Flexible Billing Attributes . |
| Billing periods | The billing period of a rate plan charge must be equal to or greater than the term length of the rate plan charge. For example:If the subscription term is 12 months, the billing period of the rate plan charges in the subscription must always be equal to or greater than 12 months. It is not allowed to set the billing period to four months.If the subscription term is 36 months, the billing period of the rate plan charges in the subscription must be equal to or greater than 36 months.Zuora validates that the charge period indicated by the charge start and end dates must fall into or be aligned with a full billing period. If not, the validation does not pass, and the invoice schedule creation fails.For example:Charge period: start date: 31.10.2024, end date: 14.05.2026Charge billing period: five years; Subscription term: term start date: 14.11.2024, term end date: 14.05.2026In this example, the full billing period is from 14.11.2024 to 14.11.2029. However, the charge start date of 31.10.2024 does not fall into the current full billing period and spans to the previous billing period. The Invoice schedule creation fails. |
| Order actions | Some order actions are not supported in specific scenarios.If the charges in subscriptions created in an order are included in an invoice schedule, the following order actions are not supported for the orders associated with the invoice schedule:Terms And Conditions to extend or shrink the chargesSuspendResumeIf an invoice schedule has been processed, the following order actions are not supported for the orders associated with the invoice schedule:Update Product before Future-dated RemovalsUpdate Product from the middle of rate plan chargesFor detailed information about the order actions supported by invoice schedules in different statuses, see Supported order action types .Note:The Terms And Conditions order action is only supported in some cases, see Update subscription term start and service activation dates to align with GLD . |
| Data limits | The following data limits exist for the Billing Schedule feature.One invoice schedule can have at most 50 invoice schedule items through the Zuora UI and REST API.One invoice schedule can be associated with at most 10 orders through the Zuora UI and REST API.One invoice schedule can be associated with at most 50 subscriptions through the Zuora UI and at most 300 subscriptions through the REST API. |
