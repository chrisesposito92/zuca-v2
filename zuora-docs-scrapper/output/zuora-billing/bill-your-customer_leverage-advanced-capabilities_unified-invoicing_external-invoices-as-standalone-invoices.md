# External invoices as standalone invoices

Unified Invoicing supports importing invoices from external billing systems into Zuora as standalone invoices through the Zuora REST API.

Enterprises that operate multiple business lines often have more than one billing application. They either need to consolidate the billing records from each source and maintain the customized integration, or suffer from a lack of data integrity and a single view of the business and their end customers.

With Unified Invoicing, you can migrate open and historical invoices from other billing applications into Zuora as standalone invoices through the REST API. With all billing records being presented in one place, you can efficiently manage both subscription and non-subscription transactions of the same end customer at a lower cost, and streamline your reporting for account receivables and accounting operations.
