# Standalone invoices creation

This topic covers information on creating standalone invoices for non-recurring sales of goods or services to subscription customers using the Zuora UI or REST API.

A standalone invoice allows you to sell physical goods, services, or other items on a non-recurring basis to your subscription customers. You can quickly create it under a customer account through the Zuora UI or REST API, without creating a subscription, an order, or even a product catalog.

Some common one-time charges include:

-   Professional service: consulting service

-   Physical goods: a box of coffee machine pots

-   An ad-hoc fee: bank fee, penalty fee, or a parking ticket

-   Digital one-time sales: online advertisement listing

-   Add-on items: OEM products sold to a subscriber


This tutorial shows you how to create a standalone invoice for a one-time charge like this:

-   Charge name: Consulting days purchase

-   Charge type and price: one-time charge, $100 flat fee
