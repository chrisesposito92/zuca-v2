# Subscriptions, orders, and amendments for customer accounts

This chapter outlines about managing the subscriptions, orders, and amendments for customer accounts

Note:

-   Only relevant Subscribe and Amend customers who have not transitioned to Orders or Orders Harmonization. Any new customers will not see this UI.

-   Restricted if you are an existing Subscribe and Amend customer and have enabled Order Metrics only. See Known Limitations in Orders and Order Metrics.


You can create amendments to do the following:

-   Change the terms and conditions of a contract
-   Add or remove a product from the subscription
-   Update an existing product (for example, update price or quantity)
-   Renew a subscription in advance of the auto-renewal date
-   Suspend a subscription
-   Resume a subscription
