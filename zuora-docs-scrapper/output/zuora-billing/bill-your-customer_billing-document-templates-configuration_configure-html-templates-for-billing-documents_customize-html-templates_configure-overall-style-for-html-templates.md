# Configure overall style for HTML templates

Learn how to configure the overall style and appearance for HTML templates in Zuora, including layout, text, and link settings.

1.  Click your avatar at the top right and navigate to .
2.  On the Manage Invoice, Credit/Debit Memo Templates tab, click the HTML template that you want to configure overall style. The selected template is displayed in the online HTML template editor.
