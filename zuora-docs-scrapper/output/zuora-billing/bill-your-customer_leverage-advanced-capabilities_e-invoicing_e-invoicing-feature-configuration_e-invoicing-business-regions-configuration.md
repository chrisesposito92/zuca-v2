# E-invoicing business regions configuration

This topic covers information on configuring e-invoicing business regions.

After the e-invoicing service provider is configured, create a business region for your e-invoicing service provider through the Zuora UI or REST API to store the business detail information as a seller.

If you have multiple GSTINs for different states in India, you can create multiple business region objects.

To configure and manage a business region for your e-invoicing service provider through the REST API, use the following operations:

-   [Create an e-invoicing business region](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreateEInvoicingBusinessRegion/)

-   [List e-invoicing business regions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/GET_EInvoicingBusinessRegions/)

-   [Retrieve an e-invoicing business region](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/GET_EInvoicingBusinessRegion/)

-   [Update an e-invoicing business region](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/PUT_UpdateEInvoicingBusinessRegion/)

-   [Delete an e-invoicing business region](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/DELETE_EInvoicingBusinessRegion/)
