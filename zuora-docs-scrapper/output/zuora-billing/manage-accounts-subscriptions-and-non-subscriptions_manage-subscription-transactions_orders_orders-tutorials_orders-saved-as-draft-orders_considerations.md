# Considerations

This topic lists the considerations and condition rules for saving orders as draft orders, including handling failure errors and sending notifications.

Note the following limitations when saving orders as draft orders:

-   If you have added an order line item to an order, you cannot save the order to a draft order.

-   If your events are the Order and OrderAction objects based custom events that are listed in the Custom Events tab, when saving orders as draft orders, you can save the draft orders successfully. However, you may see a failure error "'To Email Address' is required." when verifying the Result of your events from Extension Studio > Events & Notifications > Email History. You can skip the failure errors or send notifications by setting condition rules on the Order and Order Action objects.


| Object | Set condition rules to skip the failure errors when saving draft orders | Set condition rules to send notifications when saving draft orders |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Order | (changeType == 'INSERT' && Order.Status != 'Draft') \|\| (changeType == 'UPDATE' && Order.Status != 'Draft' && Order.Status_old == 'Draft') | (changeType == 'INSERT' && Order.Status == 'Draft') \|\| (changeType == 'UPDATE' && Order.Status == 'Draft') |
| OrderAction | (changeType == 'INSERT' && OrderAction.Status != 'Draft' && OrderAction.AutoGenerated == 'false') \|\| (changeType == 'UPDATE' && OrderAction.Status != 'Draft' && OrderAction.Status_old == 'Draft') | (changeType == 'INSERT' && OrderAction.Status == 'Draft') \|\| (changeType == 'UPDATE' && OrderAction.Status == 'Draft') |

To set the condition rules, you can use either of the following methods:

-   Use the Update an event trigger operation to update an event trigger on the Order and Order Action objects

-   Use Zuora UI to update the events, see Manage custom events and custom scheduled events
