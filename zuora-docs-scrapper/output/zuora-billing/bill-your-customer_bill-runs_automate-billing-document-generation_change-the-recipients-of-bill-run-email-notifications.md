# Change the recipients of bill run email notifications

Learn how to change the recipients of email notifications for scheduled bill runs.

Email notifications for bill runs are sent to the user who created the applicable billing run. If you have scheduled (recurring) bill runs, you can redirect the email notifications for the bill run by performing the following steps:

1.  Cancel the scheduled bill run.
2.  Have the intended recipient of the email notification recreate the scheduled bill run.
