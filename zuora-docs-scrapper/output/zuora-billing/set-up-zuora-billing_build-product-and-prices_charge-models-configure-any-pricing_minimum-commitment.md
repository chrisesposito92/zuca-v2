# Minimum commitment

The Minimum Commitment feature enables subscription services with a required minimum spend, ensuring customers meet their contracted amount.

The Minimum Commitment feature allows you to offer subscription services in which your customers commit to spending a minimum amount. If the customers do not spend the committed amount by the end of the commitment period, they will be automatically charged a true-up to meet the contracted minimum amount. For more information, see Minimum Commitment .

The Minimum Commitment feature is supported downstream by Zuora Revenue through the Order to Revenue feature. See Overview of Revenue Recognition Events Transaction .
