# Flat fee pricing

Flat fee pricing involves a fixed charge applied either once or on a recurring basis, such as a monthly gym membership fee.

Flat fee pricing is the simplest charge model. In this model, the amount to charge is a single price (that is, a fixed amount) applied on a one-time or recurring basis. An example of a flat fee charge model would be a gym membership that costs $50 per month.

For a flat fee charge of the Usage charge type, the charge amount is always billed regardless of usage during the billing period.
