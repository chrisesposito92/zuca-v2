# Update invoice dates for draft invoices

Learn how to update the invoice date for draft invoices directly in the UI.

You can update the invoice date for any draft invoice—whether the invoice was created manually or generated through a bill run—directly from the Zuora UI.

Follow these steps to update the invoice date for a draft invoice.

1.  In the left navigation area, go to Billing > Invoices.
2.  On the Invoices page, locate and click the Invoice Number of the draft invoice you want to update.

    Note:

    You can update the invoice date only for invoices with the DRAFT status

3.  On the Invoice page, click the More actions icon (three vertical dots), and then select Edit Invoice.

    The invoice opens in edit mode.

4.  In the Invoice Date field, select a new date to update the invoice date.
5.  Click Save Updates to save the invoice with the new date.

The invoice date is updated, and the invoice remains in DRAFT status until it is posted.
