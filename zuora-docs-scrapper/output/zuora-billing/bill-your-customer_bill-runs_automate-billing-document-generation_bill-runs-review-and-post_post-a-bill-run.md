# Post a bill run

Learn how to navigate to the Bill Runs section, select a completed bill run, and post invoices.

To post a bill run, complete the following steps:

1.  Navigate to in the navigation section.
2.  Find the completed bill run that you want to post and click the bill run number to open the detail page.

    Note: Make sure the bill run has the correct accounts that you want to post invoices for

3.  Click Post.

    Note: If all of the invoices within the bill run have already been posted, clicking Post will not affect the invoices (they will not be posted again). However, if the bill run contains draft invoices, those invoices will be posted.
