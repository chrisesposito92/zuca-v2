# Amendments creation through Mass Order Entry

The Mass Order Entry feature allows you to create multiple subscription amendments by uploading a CSV file with subscription, account, and catalog data.

Note:

Creating and amending subscriptions in the Zuora Billing UI is only relevant for existing Subscribe and Amend customers who have not transitioned to Orders or Orders Harmonization . Any new customers will not see this UI.

The Mass Order Entry feature lets you create multiple subscription amendments by uploading data in a comma-separated value (CSV) file containing subscription, account, and catalog data.

## Sample File

See the sample file, MassOrderAmendSAMPLE.csv .
