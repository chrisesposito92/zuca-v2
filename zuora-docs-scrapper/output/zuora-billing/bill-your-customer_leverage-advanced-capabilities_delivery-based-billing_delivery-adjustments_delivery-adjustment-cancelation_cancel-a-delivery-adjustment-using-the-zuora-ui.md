# Cancel a delivery adjustment using the Zuora UI

Learn how to cancel a delivery adjustment in Zuora when the credit memo is posted and not fully applied.

You can cancel a delivery adjustment only if the credit memo is posted and the entire credit memo amount has not been applied. Otherwise, you need to unapply the entire credit memo amount and ensure the credit memo status is still posted. For more information, see Unapply credit memos from invoices and debit memos .

To cancel a delivery adjustment, perform the following steps:

1.  Navigate to .
2.  On the Delivery Adjustments page, filter and sort subscriptions to locate the delivery adjustment you want to cancel.
3.  Click a delivery adjustment to open the delivery adjustment details page. In the Associated Credit Memo Number section of the page, click the associated credit memo number link to verify the credit memo.
4.  Return to the Delivery Adjustments page, and in the row of the delivery adjustment, click the cancel button to cancel the delivery adjustment.
    If the cancellation succeeds, you will see a debit memo number link generated in the Debit Memo Number column, otherwise the cancellation fails.
