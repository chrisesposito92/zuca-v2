# Sample invoice templates

Explore and customize sample invoice templates, including handling syntax errors in formula fields.

You can download the default sample invoice template and customize it as needed.

Note:

Some sample templates show "!Syntax Error" in the Tax and TOTAL fields because the corresponding formula contains merge fields. The templates can work as expected, so you can ignore "!Syntax Error".
