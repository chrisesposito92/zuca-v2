# Use Cases

Explore how Dynamic Pricing (DP) enables flexible pricing strategies through real-world use cases, including region-based pricing, usage-based adjustments, and more.

Dynamic Pricing (DP) supports a wide range of real-world pricing scenarios by allowing prices to be calculated dynamically based on attributes, conditions, or rules at runtime. The following use cases illustrate how DP can be applied across charge types, currencies, geographies, and business models - covering region-based pricing, usage-based adjustments, min/max enforcement, negotiated pricing, and event-time attribute resolution through Mediation. These examples provide practical guidance on how to configure the product catalog and decision tables to meet diverse business needs.
