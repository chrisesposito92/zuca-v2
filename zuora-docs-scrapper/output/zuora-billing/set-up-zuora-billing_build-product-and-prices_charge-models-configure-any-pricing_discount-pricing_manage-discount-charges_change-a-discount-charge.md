# Change a discount charge

Learn how to update or remove a discount charge by creating amendments.

You can update a percentage discount charge by creating an amendment. But you cannot update a fixed-amount discount charge to change the value of a discount that you have already provided. Because your customers may have applied the discount to their subscriptions, you cannot change the terms of the discount.

To update a fixed-amount discount charge, you must remove the existing discount charge and add a new discount:

1.  Create an amendment to remove the incorrect discount charge.
2.  Create a second amendment to add the corrected discount charge.
3.  Your customers can then apply the new discount to new subscriptions.
