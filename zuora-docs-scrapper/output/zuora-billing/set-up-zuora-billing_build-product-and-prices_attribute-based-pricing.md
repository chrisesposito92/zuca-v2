# Attribute-based pricing

Learn how to use Attribute-based Pricing to configure products and prices using key business attributes.

Enable the Attribute-based Pricing feature to build your products and prices based on multiple attributes that matter to your business.

Note:

Attribute-Based Pricing is planned for deprecation and is no longer recommended for new implementations. We do not recommend adopting this approach going forward. For guidance on supported alternatives, such as the Enhanced Dynamic Pricing framework, please reach out to your Zuora representative.
