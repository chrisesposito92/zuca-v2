# Purchase an app

Learn how to purchase an app in the Zuora Marketplace and set it up for use in your organization.

To get started, you have to purchase an app first and create an OAuth login for your Tax app to connect to Zuora.. You can purchase apps in the Marketplace that is available in your tenant.

1.  In the left navigation menu of Zuora, select Marketplace \> Marketplace. The available apps are displayed.
2.  Find the app that you want to purchase.
3.  Click Purchase on the overview page of the app. Zuora will then contact you with information about completing the purchase and setting up the app.

Purchased apps can be used by all Zuora administrators and Zuora standard users in your organization. To view your purchased apps, navigate to in your Zuora tenant. Before you can use a purchased app, you must install the app.
