# E-Invoice cancelation

This topic covers information about the E-Invoice cancelation and its workflow.

You can cancel approved e-invoices directly from Zuora with Sovos integration without manual steps in Sovos or the local government portal. Zuora provides e-invoice cancelation feature as an out-of-the-box feature, where you don’t need to configure templates or response mappings.

In many countries—such as India, Italy, and Saudi Arabia—an e-invoice can be fixed by issuing a credit memo. However, in some jurisdictions like Mexico and Brazil, tax regulations do not allow amendments through credit memos. Instead, the original invoice must be canceled by submitting a formal cancelation request to the tax authority.

The cancelation workflow integrates seamlessly with Zuora’s billing operations. The following diagram depicts a typical cancelation workflow.
