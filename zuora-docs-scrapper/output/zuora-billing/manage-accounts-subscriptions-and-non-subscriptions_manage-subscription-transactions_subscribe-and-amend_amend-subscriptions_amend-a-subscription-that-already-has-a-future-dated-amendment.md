# Amend a subscription that already has a future-dated amendment

This article explains how to manage subscriptions with future-dated amendments, including creating amendments with effective dates before existing amendments.

Future-dated amendments take effect at a future date. You can create future-dated amendment on the subscription. Zuora also supports creating certain types of amendments as long as subscriptions are activated before the existing future-dated amendment on the subscription.

The amendment with an effective date before existing future-dated amendment may refer to any of the following:

| Amendment Date | Amendment Type |

| Trigger date | Add ProductRemove ProductUpdate Product |
| New term end date | Terms and ConditionsRenew |
| Cancellation date | Cancel amendments |
| Day of amendment | Owner Transfer |
| Suspend date | Suspend |
| Resume date | Resume |
