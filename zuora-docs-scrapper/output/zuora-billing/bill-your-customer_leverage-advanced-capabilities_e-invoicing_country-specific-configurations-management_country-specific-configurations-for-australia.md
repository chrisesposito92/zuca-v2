# Country-specific configurations for Australia

Information on configuring e-invoicing for businesses in Australia, including integration with Avalara and Zuora.

Australia is part of the Peppol network. If your business sells products and services in Australia, you can configure the E-Invoicing feature to generate e-invoice files as required by Australian mandates.

This article provides detailed instructions on how to configure e-invoicing in both Avalara and Zuora.

Note: You will need an Australian Business Number (ABN).
