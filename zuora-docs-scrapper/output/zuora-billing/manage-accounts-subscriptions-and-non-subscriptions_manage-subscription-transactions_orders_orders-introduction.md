# Orders introduction

This article provides an introduction to the Orders feature, including its use in a multi-entity environment and links to tutorials for further learning.

This guide introduces Orders. If you have enabled Multi-entity , the Orders feature is enabled on an individual entity basis.

See Orders tutorials for how to use Orders and see Order action tutorials for how to use order actions.

Note: If you are an existing Zuora Subscribe and Amend customer, we recommend you enable Orders Harmonization to access the Orders feature. With Orders, you can access both existing functions for subscription and billing management and the new features on Zuora Billing.
