# Customer accounts management

The Customer Accounts page centralizes billing information management, including company details, payment terms, and methods, for handling subscriptions, invoices, and payments efficiently.

The Customer Accounts page is the single, centralized place to manage all billing information about your customers, including company and contact information, payment terms, and preferred payment methods. Use customer accounts to collect all the critical information about the companies and customers you are billing, such as subscriptions and amendments, invoices, payments, and adjustments.
