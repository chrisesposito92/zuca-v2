# Tenant type identification for managing subscriptions

This topic explains how to identify your tenant type to manage subscriptions effectively.

Subscription customers can log into any of the following tenants to manage their subscriptions:

-   [Orders](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zuora-billing/manage-accounts-subscriptions-and-non-subscriptions/manage-subscription-transactions/orders)
-   [Subscribe and Amend](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zuora-billing/manage-accounts-subscriptions-and-non-subscriptions/manage-subscription-transactions/subscribe-and-amend)
-   [Orders Harmonization](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zuora-billing/manage-accounts-subscriptions-and-non-subscriptions/manage-subscription-transactions/orders-harmonization)

The tenant type can be identified directly from the tabs listed under the Customers tab.
