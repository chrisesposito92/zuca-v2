# Dynamic Pricing Support

This topic allows you to explore how dynamic pricing enables real-time price adjustments based on pricing attribute values.

Dynamic pricing is a flexible pricing strategy that allows companies to adjust the cost of goods or services in real-time based on various factors. The list price of charges is determined based on the pricing attribute values. For dynamic pricing details in product catalog, see Dynamic Pricing.

Note:

Dynamic Pricing is the strategic evolution of Attribute-Based Pricing (ABP), which is now planned for deprecation. We recommend that all new implementations use the Dynamic Pricing framework going forward.

Before using the dynamic pricing feature via Orders, you must ensure the following:

1.  Either Orders or Order Harmonization must be enabled and you must follow the Orders UI/API to manage Dynamic Pricing enabled subscriptions.

2.  Legacy Attribute-Based Pricing (ABP) feature is not enabled.
