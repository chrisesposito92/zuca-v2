# Subscription or Rate Plan Summary table configuration

Configure Subscription and Rate Plan Summary Tables to display metadata and financial details with customizable row views.

The Subscription and Rate Plan Summary Tables display the metadata for subscriptions and rate plans, as well as the Subtotal, Tax, and Total. You can configure these tables to display one row per subscription or rate plan by specifying the ViewBy parameter. The Subtotal, Tax, and TOTAL will be rolled up accordingly.
