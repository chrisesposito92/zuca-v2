# Bill runs information

Explore methods to find and manage bill runs using Expanded View or List View, and search by bill run ID.

You can find your bill runs by either browsing (using Expanded View or List View) or searching for bill runs specifically. You can search by bill run ID numbers.

-   Expanded View: Expanded View includes basic information about your bill runs. In expanded view, you can post the bill run or cancel the bill run from this view. In expanded view, you can also see a summary of all of your bill runs to the right of the expanded list. The summary shows the number of bill runs by status (for example, fifteen bill runs pending).
-   List View: List view is a list of your bill runs. From the list view, you can either view or delete a bill run, and you can sort the view by selecting the column headers.

After you create a bill run, you can view information about the bill run.
