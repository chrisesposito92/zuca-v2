# Key metrics for customer accounts

This article provides an overview of key metrics for customer accounts, including Account Balance, MRR, and Last Invoiced date.

This article provides an overview for each customer account that includes key metrics for the account. With one glance at key metrics, you can see the customer’s Account Balance, Contracted Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Today’s MRR, and Last Invoiced date. If you have enabled the Orders feature, Order metrics are available for each order action. See Key Metrics for Orders for more information.

## Balance Examples

For example: You pay $50 into an account that has no invoice. The credit balance of account is $50, the total invoice balance is $0, and the account balance is -$50 (negative $50).

You then create two invoices with invoice amounts of $100 and $200. The total invoice balance is now $300, the credit balance is still $50, and the account balance is $250 ($300 invoice balance, minus the $50 credit balance).

Any payment can be applied to an invoice to reduce the balance of the invoice. This reduces the total invoice balance and the account balance. If you refund from a credit balance to a customer, this reduces the credit balance and increases the account balance, even though the total invoice balance does not change.
