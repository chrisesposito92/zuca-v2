# Enable indistinct mapping

Learn how to enable indistinct mapping in the billing settings.

To enable the indistinct mapping method, complete the following steps.

1.  Click your username at the upper right and navigate to Settings > Billing .
2.  On the Billing Settings page, click Define Billing Rules .
3.  On the Billing Rules page, click edit .
4.  From the Allow indistinct mapping from Memo / Invoice Item Adjustment tax item to invoice item tax list, select Yes.

    Note: After indistinct mapping is enabled, Zuora still tries distinct mapping first. If it fails, indistinct mapping is applied.
