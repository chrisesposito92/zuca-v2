# Automate billing document generation

Learn how to automate billing document generation with Zuora Billing, enabling accurate and efficient invoice creation for individual or multiple customers.

As a billing manager, you need accurate data and a way to generate your customer invoices. With Zuora Billing, you can create all your invoices before payment collection. You can generate a single invoice for your customer, or you can generate invoices for a group of your customers or all of your customers at once. Moreover, you can generate ad hoc invoices, that is, invoices on demand, or you can create one or more schedules to generate your invoices automatically. If you enable the Invoice Settlement feature, credit memos can be automatically generated for negative charges according to your configuration.

In addition, when ad hoc changes occur to your customers' subscriptions or complex pricing strategies are adopted, Zuora Billing provides a rating engine to ensure that each amount on the invoice is handled with accuracy and efficiency.
