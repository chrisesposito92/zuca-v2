# Threshold Notification

The Threshold Notification feature allows setting consumption thresholds for prepaid balance or unbilled usage, triggering notifications when exceeded.

The Threshold Notification feature enables you to set consumption thresholds for prepaid balance or unbilled usage. When the thresholds are exceeded, your customers will receive notifications.

-   For Prepaid with Drawdown, the Prepaid Validity Period Summary data source supports configuring one or more percentage values or fixed numbers of quantity at the validity period level as thresholds and sending notifications when the remaining balance reaches the thresholds.

-   For Unbilled Usage, the Rating Result data source supports configuring one or more percentage values or fixed numbers of quantity as thresholds and sending notifications when the usage amount reaches the thresholds.
