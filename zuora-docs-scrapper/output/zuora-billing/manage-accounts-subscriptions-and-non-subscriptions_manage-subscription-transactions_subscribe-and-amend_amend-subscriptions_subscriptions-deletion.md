# Subscriptions deletion

This topic explains for deleting subscriptions in the Zuora Billing UI, applicable to specific customer scenarios.

Note:

Creating and amending subscriptions in the Zuora Billing UI is only relevant for existing Subscribe and Amend customers who have not transitioned to Orders or Orders Harmonization . Any new customers will not see this UI.

You can delete a subscription only if an invoice has not been generated.
