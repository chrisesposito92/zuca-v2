# Communication profile for Credit Memo and Debit Memo

The system inherits communication profiles for credit and debit memos from invoices or accounts, depending on their origin.

If a credit memo or debit memo is created from an invoice that has a communication profile, the system automatically inherits that communication profile from the invoice.

If a standalone credit memo or debit memo is created from product rate plan charge, the system inherits the communication profile directly from the account.
