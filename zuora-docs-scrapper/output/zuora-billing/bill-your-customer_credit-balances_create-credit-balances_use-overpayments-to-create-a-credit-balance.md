# Use overpayments to create a credit balance

Learn how to create a credit balance by using an overpayment

You can use external or electronic payments to create a payment that is greater than the invoice amount due. The payment amount that exceeds the invoice amount is applied to the credit balance.

To create a credit balance by using an overpayment, complete these steps.

1.  Navigate to Billing > Invoices to find the target invoice with a positive balance.
2.  Click the invoice number to open the invoice details page, click the three vertical dots icon to see more applicable actions, and then click Create Payment . The Process a Payment page opens.
3.  In the Payment Total field, increase the value by the amount you want to apply to the credit balance. The Applied to Invoices field displays the amount to be applied to the current invoice. The Remaining Amount field displays the amount to be applied to a credit balance.
4.  Click Create Payment . A confirmation dialog indicates that you are applying an overpayment to the credit balance.
5.  Click Yes to confirm that you want to create a credit balance from the overpayment.

    Note:

    The payment amount transferred to the credit balance cannot be refunded because it is now part of the credit balance. You must perform an external refund of the credit balance separately.
