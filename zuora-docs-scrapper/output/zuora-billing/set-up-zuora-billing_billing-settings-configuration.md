# Billing settings configuration

This topic covers information on configuring billing settings in Zuora to customize default values for your organization.

When you first start using Zuora, many configuration settings are pre-populated with common default values. Users with administrative privileges can tailor these out-of-the-box values to custom settings that will work better for their organizations.

To access the billing settings of your tenant, click your username at the upper right and then click Billing. The Billing Settings page opens, listing all applicable configuration settings.
