# Amendment or cancelation of subscriptions before the last invoice dates

This guide explains how to amend or cancel subscriptions before the last invoice date, including limitations on usage charges.

You have generated invoices for the current month and posted them to customers. After posting the invoices, you may need to make an amendment or cancelation that becomes effective in a previous month, which is before the last invoice date. This article shows you how to amend or cancel a subscription before the last invoice date.

Note:

Creating and amending subscriptions in the Zuora Billing UI is only relevant for existing Subscribe and Amend customers who have not transitioned to Orders or Orders Harmonization . Any new customers will not see this UI.
