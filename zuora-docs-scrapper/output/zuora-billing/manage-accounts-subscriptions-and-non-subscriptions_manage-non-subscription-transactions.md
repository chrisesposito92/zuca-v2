# Manage non-subscription transactions

This article explains about managing non-subscription transactions using order line items in Zuora, including associating them with existing subscriptions.

Zuora allows you to implement non-subscription transactions through order line items. Order line items are non subscription based items created through an order, representing transactional charges such as one-time fees, physical goods, or professional service charges that are not sold as subscription services.

Zuora also allows you to associate your order line items with existing subscriptions .

You can create order line items through an order in the Orders or Orders Harmonization tenant.
