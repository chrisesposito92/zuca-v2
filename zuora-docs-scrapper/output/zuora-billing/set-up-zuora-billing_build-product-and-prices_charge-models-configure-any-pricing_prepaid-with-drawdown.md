# Prepaid with drawdown

The Prepaid with Drawdown feature enables upfront payment and consumption against a prepaid balance, with options for topping up or handling overages.

The Prepaid with Drawdown feature allows your customers to pay upfront and then consume against the prepaid balance with the possibility of topping up or being charged for any overage. You can set the prepaid charges to be either currency-based or units-based. Additionally, the details of prepayment and drawdown can be presented on invoices. For more information, see Prepaid with Drawdown .

The Prepaid with Drawdown feature is supported downstream by Zuora Revenue through the Order to Revenue feature. See Overview of Revenue Recognition Events Transaction .
