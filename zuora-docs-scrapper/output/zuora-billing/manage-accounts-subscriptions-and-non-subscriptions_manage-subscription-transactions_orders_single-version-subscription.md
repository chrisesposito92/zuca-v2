# Single Version Subscription

This topic covers the Single Version Subscription feature, available to new customers and tenants, currently in Early Availability.

This guide introduces the Single Version Subscription feature that is only available to new customers and tenants.

Note:

-   Only subscriptions created through orders can be single version subscriptions. The Single Version Subscription feature is in the Early Availability phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small group of early adopters before releasing it as generally available. If you want to join this early availability program, submit a request at Zuora Global Support .

-   In the Early Availability phase, you can turn on this feature only for new customers and new tenants. Single version subscriptions and versioned subscriptions cannot coexist in the same tenant, which means you cannot turn on this feature in a tenant with versioned subscriptions.
