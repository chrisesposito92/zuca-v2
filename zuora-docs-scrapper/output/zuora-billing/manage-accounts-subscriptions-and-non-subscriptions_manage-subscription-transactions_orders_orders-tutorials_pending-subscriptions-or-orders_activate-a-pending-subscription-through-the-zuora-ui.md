# Activate a pending subscription through the Zuora UI

This task explains how to activate a pending subscription using the Zuora UI by following a series of steps to set activation dates and update subscription status.

To activate a pending subscription on the reinvented subscription page, perform the following steps:

1.  Navigate to Customers > Subscriptions.
2.  Search for the subscription by selecting Status - Pending Activation or Status - Pending Acceptance in the Quick filter field and using other searchable and filterable fields . Select the status depending on whether the service activation date or customer acceptance date is unfilled.
3.  Click the subscription number in the row of the pending subscription to open the subscription details page.
4.  At the top right on the subscription details page, click Set Activation Dates at the top right.
5.  Do one of the following in the window that pops up:

    -   Enter the empty Service Activation , Customer Acceptance field, or both if the service activation date, customer acceptance date, or both are unfilled for the subscription

    -   Enter the empty Specific Update Date field if the Specific Trigger Date is unfilled for the charges with the Triggering Condition of the charges set as Upon a Specific Date


6.  Click Save . Then, the status next to the subscription number displays as Activate, which indicates the pending subscription is activated.
