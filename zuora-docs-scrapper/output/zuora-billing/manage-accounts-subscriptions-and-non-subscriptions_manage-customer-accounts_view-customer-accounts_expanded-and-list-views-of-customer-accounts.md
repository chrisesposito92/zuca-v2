# Expanded and list views of customer accounts

This topic explains how to navigate and utilize the Expanded and List views in the Customer Accounts module to manage account details and statuses effectively.

When you access the Customer Accounts module, you can view the list of accounts in either Expanded or List view.

## Using the Views

Click the appropriate tab to switch between views:

-   Expanded View is the default view that shows an image, account name, account number, sold to contact, bill to contact, account balance, date the account was created on, date the account was last invoiced, sales rep, and the status of the account (active or draft).

-   List View is a condensed view that shows the account name, account number, bill to contact, account balance, date the account was last invoiced, and account status.


You can see details on a specific account by clicking the account name in either view.

## Account Status in List View

When you view the list of customers in list view, the account status is part of the view. A customer account status can be Active or Canceled.

-   Active: When your account is Active, you can create subscriptions, invoices, and collect payments when you are ready to do so.

-   Canceled: You can cancel any of your accounts. This is useful if you want to track the customers that you are not doing business with (for example, they canceled their subscriptions). You can also reactivate a customer if you need to at a later time.


## Reporting on Account Status

You can create reports based on account status. This is a good way to see the number of customers you have (by filtering for "account status = active") and the number of customers that have left (by filtering for "account status = canceled").
