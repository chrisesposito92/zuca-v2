# Merge fields for invoices

This topic provides an overview of merge fields for invoices, including their definitions and usage in conditional logic.

In most cases, the field definitions are self-evident, based on the fields of the user interface. Additional descriptions are provided as needed.

See [Merge Fields Supported in IF Fields on Invoice Templates](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/billing-document-templates-configuration/create-word-templates-for-invoices/merge-fields-supported-in-if-fields-on-invoice-tempaltes) for information about which merge fields can be used in [Conditional Logic (IF Fields)](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/billing-document-templates-configuration/create-word-templates-for-invoices/conditional-logic-if-fields).

Note:

Zuora recommends that you use [Transaction Table](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/billing-document-templates-configuration/create-word-templates-for-invoices/merge-fields-for-invoices/transaction-fields) instead of the [Invoice Adjustment fields](/zuora-billing/bill-your-customer/billing-document-templates-configuration/create-word-templates-for-invoices/merge-fields-for-invoices/invoice-adjustment-fields).
