# Revenue Recognition Policy

The Revenue Recognition Policy page offers configuration options for timing and amortization methods, essential for setting up product rate plan charges.

The Revenue Recognition Policy page provides configuration options for both Revenue Recognition Timing and the Revenue Amortization Method. To access the Revenue Recognition Policy page, click your username at the top right and navigate to Revenue > Revenue Recognition Policy.

## Revenue Recognition Timing

Pre-defined and custom options can be configured for the Revenue Recognition Timing setting. The predefined and custom options are used as enum values to choose from when you set up a product rate plan charge and configure the Revenue Recognition Timing field for the product rate plan charge.

There are two pre-defined options: Upon Order Activation Date and Upon Billing Document Posting Date. You cannot edit, inactivate, or remove a predefined option.

## Revenue Amortization Method
