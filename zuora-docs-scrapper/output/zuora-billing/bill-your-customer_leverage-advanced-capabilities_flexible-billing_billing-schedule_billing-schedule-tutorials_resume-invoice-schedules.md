# Resume invoice schedules

Learn how to resume a paused invoice schedule using the REST API or the Zuora UI.

If an invoice schedule has been paused, you can resume it as needed.

To resume a paused invoice schedule through the REST API, use the Resume an invoice schedule operation.

To resume a paused invoice schedule through the Zuora UI, perform the following steps:

1.  In the left navigation section, navigate to Customers > Orders .
2.  On the Orders page, click the number of the order associated with the invoice schedule that you want to view information about.
3.  On the order details page, click the number of the invoice schedule that you want to resume in the basic information section.
4.  On the invoice schedule details page, click Resume in the upper right.

    The corresponding invoice schedule is resumed to the status before you paused the invoice schedule.

    Alternatively, you can also navigate to a subscription associated with a paused invoice schedule first, and find the invoice schedule that you want to resume.
