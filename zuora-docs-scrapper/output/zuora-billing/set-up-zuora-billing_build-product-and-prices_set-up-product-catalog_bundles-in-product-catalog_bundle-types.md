# Bundle types

Zuora offers conceptual bundle types, including Hard Bundles and upcoming Dynamic Bundles.

Zuora’s overall bundling model includes the following conceptual bundle types:

-   Hard Bundles - A fixed set of products or services sold together under a bundle SKU. Components must be purchased together, cannot be unbundled, and appear as itemized line items on invoices. Component-level usage can still be tracked. The bundle has preset pricing and revenue attribution back to its components.

-   Dynamic bundles – coming soon – Bundles assembled at runtime based on rules such as eligibility, compatibility, and context. Dynamic bundles (also referred to as configurable bundles) are powered by Zuora’s rules engine and context attributes. Dynamic bundles are not part of the current EA scope.


Note:

Only Hard Bundles are supported in the current release.
