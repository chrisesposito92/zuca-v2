# Subscriptions resumption

This tutorial guides you through resuming a subscription by creating an order, including setting key dates to today's date.

This tutorial demonstrates how to resume a subscription by creating an order. A suspended one-time charge will not be resumed if the resume date is after the one-time charge's start date.

In this tutorial, you will set the following dates to today's date:

-   The date when the order is signed

-   The contract effective date of the transfer

-   The service activation date of the transfer

-   The customer acceptance date of the transfer
