# Country-specific configurations in Sovos for India

Understand the e-invoicing requirements and configuration process for businesses in India, including compliance with GSTN and setup in Sovos.

If you are a business provider selling products or services to public sector companies or other businesses in India, you must comply with the e-invoicing requirements. In India, e-invoice files for billing documents are electronically authenticated by the Goods and Service Tax Network (GSTN) portal. Under the electronic invoicing system, an identification number called the Invoice Reference Number (IRN) and a QR code are issued against each billing document by the Invoice Registration Portal (IRP), managed by the GSTN.
