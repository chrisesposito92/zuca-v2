# Regenerate booking transaction on subscription

Learn how to regenerate a booking transaction on a subscription by following a series of steps.

If you have a subscription booking that needs to be regenerated, do the following:

1.  Click on Subscriptions.
2.  Click on the three dots next to the Create Order button.
3.  Select the option Regenerate Booking Transaction.

The Regenerate Result screen will appear and display the regenerated bookings with their Sales Order Line ID and related information.

Note: Note that the Regenerate Booking Transaction option will be available only to the [users with 'Manage OTR Transactions Regeneration' permission](/zuora-platform/system-management/administrator-settings/user-roles/billing-roles).
