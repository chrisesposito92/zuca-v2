# Flexible subscription management

This topic explains about managing billing, taxation, and payment at a granular level with flexible subscription options.

Flexible Billing Attributes provides you the flexibility to manage billing, taxation, and payment at a more granular level other than the Account level.

-   Flexible subscription management provides you the capability to have different bill-to contacts, sold-to contacts, payment terms, invoice templates, and sequence sets for subscriptions.

-   Flexible invoicing provides you the capability to bill subscriptions according to the same billing attributes.


For more information, see Flexible Billing Attributes .
