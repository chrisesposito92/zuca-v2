# Subscription Information Fields

Zuora Billing requires specific information for subscription creation, including mandatory and optional fields, with initial values derived from default settings.

When you create a subscription, Zuora Billing requires information for all of the fields listed in this section (with the exception of Notes , which is an optional field). Some fields obtain initial values from your default subscription settings. Use the Define Default Subscription Settings page to configure the default subscription settings.

| Customer Name | The name of the customer account (also referred to as a billing account) that is subscribing to your products or services.There are two ways to search for the customer name. You can use the type-ahead search by entering a few letters of the customer account name and Zuora Billing will provide a narrowed down list of possibilities. Or you can type in the full or partial customer name and click Search . Zuora Billing will populate all of the matching customer names in a list, from which you can select the applicable customer account name. |

This can only be done while the subscription is in the draft state.

See Define Numbering and SKU Formats for more information. |
