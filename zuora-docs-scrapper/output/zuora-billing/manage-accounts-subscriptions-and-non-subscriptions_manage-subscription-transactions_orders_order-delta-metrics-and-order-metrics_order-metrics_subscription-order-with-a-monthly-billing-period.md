# Subscription order with a monthly billing period

This example demonstrates how to create a subscription order with a monthly billing period, using a Per Unit Pricing model, and the resulting order metrics generated by Zuora.

On 1/1/2018 you use a Create Subscription order action to subscribe a customer to 10 units of your product for 1 year, with a monthly billing period. The product uses the Per Unit Pricing charge model with a list price of $8.00 per unit. When you subscribe the customer to the product, you reduce the list price to $5.00. This means that you expect to post an invoice for $50.00 ( = 10 × $5.00) each month.

Zuora then creates the following order metrics:

| Order Metric | Start Date | End Date | Value | Calculation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Order Quantity | 1/1/2018 | 12/31/2018 | 10 | Number of units |
| Order Mrr | 1/1/2018 | 12/31/2018 | 50.00 | Value of Order Quantity × list price (5.00) |
| Order Tcb | 1/1/2018 | 12/31/2018 | 600.00 | Jan-Dec: 12 months × Value of Order Mrr |
| Order Tcv | 1/1/2018 | 12/31/2018 | 600.00 | Jan-Dec: 12 months × Value of Order Mrr |
| Order Elp | 1/1/2018 | 12/31/2018 | 960.00 | Jan-Dec: 12 months × Value of Order Quantity × original list price (8.00) |

This example assumes that the customer's bill cycle day is set to the 1st of the month.

On 4/1/2018, you use an Update Product order action to increase the quantity to 13. Zuora then creates the following order metrics:
