It can be triggered by factors like a decrease in expected sales prices or adjustments flagged by the R AND R WITHIN SSP. This results in a need to adjust the allocated prices and recognize a loss in revenue.","source":"zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations_contract-impairment-overview_r-and-r-within-ssp-partial-impairment.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"What's the difference between RSP and Allocated Price in Zuora Revenue?","response":"RSP (Relative Selling Price) is calculated as the Extended SSP Price divided by the sum of Extended SSP Prices for all lines in the contract, reflecting the proportion of revenue attributable to each line. In contrast, Allocated Price is determined by multiplying the sum of Extended Sell Prices by the RSP, indicating the actual revenue allocated to each line item based on their relative values.","source":"zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations_contract-impairment-overview_r-and-r-within-ssp-partial-impairment.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"comparison"}
{"instruction":"Can you give an example of how to handle a carve-out in Zuora Revenue?","response":"In Zuora Revenue, a carve-out occurs when a line item is modified, leading to a decrease in allocated revenue. For example, if a support line with an Extended Sell Price of $3600 is partially canceled with an impairment amount of $200, the Allocated Price would still be calculated based on the RSP. After the adjustment, the new values would reflect the reduced revenue, and accounting entries would be updated to capture these changes accordingly.","source":"zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations_contract-impairment-overview_r-and-r-within-ssp-partial-impairment.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"example"}
{"instruction":"What is the RORD collection sequence in Zuora Revenue?","response":"The RORD collection sequence in Zuora Revenue refers to the order in which RORD lines are collected, particularly when dealing with Type 4 impairments. Type 4 RORD lines must be collected last and in a separate batch from other RORD types (Type 1, 2, or 3) to ensure correct accounting treatment. This sequence is crucial because collecting Type 4 lines first can disrupt the allocation process for the associated revenue contracts.","source":"zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations_contract-impairment-overview_rord-collection-sequence.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"definitional"}
{"instruction":"How do I collect RORD lines with Type 4 in Zuora Revenue?","response":"To collect RORD lines with Type 4, you need to create a separate batch specifically for these lines. Ensure that you collect RORD lines of Types 1, 2, or 3 in a different batch first. The system treats these batches independently; if you attempt to collect Type 4 lines in the same batch with other types, the collection will be stopped in staging. After collecting Type 4 lines, check if adjustments are needed based on the allocation status.","source":"zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations_contract-impairment-overview_rord-collection-sequence.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"procedural"}
{"instruction":"Why might the collection of RORD lines of Type 4 be stopped in staging?","response":"The collection of RORD lines of Type 4 might be stopped in staging if they are attempted to be collected in the same batch as other RORD types (Type 1, 2, or 3). The system enforces that Type 4 RORD lines must be collected last in a separate batch to prevent issues with revenue allocation for the associated contracts. If you encounter this issue, you can either separate the batches or update the impairment type flag to ensure compliance with the collection requirements.","source":"zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations_contract-impairment-overview_rord-collection-sequence.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"What's the difference between collecting RORD lines of Type 1, 2, or 3 and collecting Type 4?","response":"The key difference lies in the collection sequence and impact on revenue contracts. RORD lines of Type 1, 2, or 3 can be collected together in the same batch without restriction. In contrast, Type 4 lines must be collected last in a separate batch. This is due to the accounting implications of Type 4 impairments, which can freeze allocations and require specific handling of the associated revenue contracts.","source":"zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations_contract-impairment-overview_rord-collection-sequence.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"comparison"}
{"instruction":"Can you give an example of how to handle RORD lines with Type 4?","response":"For instance, if you have RORD lines of Type 1 and Type 4 that need to be collected, first create a batch for the Type 1 lines and collect them. After that, create a separate batch for the Type 4 lines. If the Type 4 lines are collected after the Type 1 lines, ensure that the revenue contract has not been impacted by any previous allocations. If it has, you may need to manually unfreeze the contract to proceed with the collection of Type 4 lines.","source":"zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations_contract-impairment-overview_rord-collection-sequence.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"example"}

{"instruction":"Can you give an example of how LT/ST reclassification affects accounting entries?","response":"In a scenario where the LT balance is positive, for instance, if the calculated LT balance is $2,310, the accounting entries would show a debit of $2,310 to the Contract Liability (short-term) and a credit of $2,310 to the Long-term Contract Liability for the period MAR-19. Conversely, if the LT balance is negative, the entries would be reversed, booking a credit to the Contract Liability (short-term) and a debit to the Long-term Contract Liability for the same amount. This demonstrates how LT/ST reclassification directly impacts financial statements.","source":"zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations_long-term-and-short-term-reclassification_ltst-reclassification-processing-logic_netting-at-application-level-and-rc-is-in-ca-position.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"example"}

{"instruction":"How do I determine the CA/CL position using the enhanced netting process?","response":"To determine the CA/CL position using the enhanced netting process, follow these steps: First, check the billed amount and revenue recognized to date for each line in the revenue contract (RC). If all values are positive, calculate the CA/CL balance using the formula: Actual CA/CL Balance = Total Billed Amount - Total Revenue to Date. If there are negative values, treat them as positive and calculate a line-level CA/CL Determination Amount. Sum these amounts to find the RC-level CA/CL Determination Amount and use it to determine the CA/CL position for the entire RC.","source":"zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations_zuora-revenue-changes-for-integration-with-zuora-billing_1_enhanced-cacl-netting-process.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"procedural"}
{"instruction":"Why might the CA/CL position be incorrectly determined during netting?","response":"The CA/CL position might be incorrectly determined during netting if negative charge lines are not adequately accounted for. For instance, if a large negative value on a discount charge line is present, it could skew the overall calculation and erroneously classify the revenue contract as a CA position when it should actually be a CL position. The enhancements aim to rectify this by properly considering negative values in the calculations.","source":"zuora-revenue/advanced-revenue-operations_zuora-revenue-changes-for-integration-with-zuora-billing_1_enhanced-cacl-netting-process.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"What's the difference between the normal CA/CL netting process and the enhanced process?","response":"The primary difference between the normal CA/CL netting process and the enhanced process lies in how negative charge lines are handled.

{"instruction":"What's the difference between invoice-based CM-R and SO-based CM-R accounting?","response":"The main difference between invoice-based CM-R and SO-based CM-R accounting lies in the triggering events for accounting entries. Invoice-based CM-R accounting focuses on entries created during the invoicing process, impacting contract liability and revenue upon invoice collection. In contrast, SO-based CM-R accounting is centered around the sales order entries, which influence contract liability and revenue recognition at the time of booking the sales order.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_cm-r-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"comparison"}
{"instruction":"Can you give an example of how a CM-R line impacts contract liability?","response":"In an example of a CM-R line impact, suppose you have an initial sales order line of $100. If a CM-R line with an EXT_SLL_PRC value of -$100 is collected, it results in an adjustment to the contract liability. The initial entry will show a debit of $100 to contract liability, and the balance will adjust to reflect the new contract liability after considering this return, resulting in a net liability of $80 (after subtracting the return from the original entry).","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_cm-r-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"example"}
{"instruction":"What are INV accounting entries in Zuora Revenue?","response":"INV accounting entries in Zuora Revenue refer to the accounting impacts generated when invoices are created in relation to sales order (SO) lines. They illustrate how revenue and contract liability are recorded during billing events, particularly when the release event is set to 'Upon Billing'. The entries consist of debits and credits that reflect the financial transactions associated with invoices linked to sales orders.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_inv-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"definitional"}
{"instruction":"How do I process an invoice in Zuora Revenue with a release event set to Upon Billing?","response":"To process an invoice in Zuora Revenue when the release event is set to 'Upon Billing', first, ensure that the sales order (SO) has been uploaded with the appropriate line items. When the invoice is created, it will generate one-sided initial accounting entries for the amount of the invoice. For instance, if an invoice of $100 is collected, a corresponding accounting entry is recorded in the Contract Liability account, reflecting the accounting impact without altering the SO until it is billed.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_inv-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"procedural"}
{"instruction":"Why might there be no accounting impact for an SO update in Zuora Revenue?","response":"There may be no accounting impact for an SO update in Zuora Revenue if the release event is set to 'Upon Billing'. In this scenario, any updates to the SO line value, such as increasing it from $100 to $180, do not trigger immediate accounting entries. The accounting impact is only recognized when an invoice is created, which is why the update remains without effect until the billing process occurs.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_inv-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"What's the difference between the Right_to_Bill flag being Y and N in Zuora Revenue?","response":"The Right_to_Bill flag in Zuora Revenue determines whether the accounting entries associated with an SO line are affected when an invoice is created. If the flag is set to Y, it indicates that the revenue can be recognized at the time of billing, while an N flag suggests that the revenue recognition is deferred. Both flags impact the accounting entries generated, but they do not change the overall process of invoice creation or its associated entries.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_inv-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"comparison"}
{"instruction":"Can you give an example of how accounting entries are recorded when an invoice is collected in Zuora Revenue?","response":"For instance, when a $100 invoice is collected in Zuora Revenue, the accounting entries recorded would typically include a debit to the Contract Liability for $100 and a corresponding credit to Revenue for $100. If the Right_to_Bill flag is set to Y, the initial entry is marked accordingly. If a subsequent invoice of $80 is then collected, it would generate additional entries reflecting the new total in the Contract Liability and Revenue accounts, cumulatively updating the balances.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_inv-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"example"}
{"instruction":"What are PORD accounting entries in Zuora Revenue?","response":"PORD accounting entries in Zuora Revenue refer to the accounting behaviors and adjustments related to Price Order Adjustments (PORD). These entries reflect changes in the sales order (SO) line values, whether there are price increases or decreases, and outline how these adjustments affect contract liability and revenue accounts over time.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_pord-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"definitional"}
{"instruction":"How do I create a PORD accounting entry for a price decrease?","response":"To create a PORD accounting entry for a price decrease in Zuora Revenue, first upload the sales order (SO) line with the initial amount. If the price is then adjusted downwards, upload another SO line with the new decreased value. Zuora Revenue will automatically generate the necessary accounting entries to reflect the decrease in contract liability and an increase in revenue. Make sure to associate any invoices with the adjusted SO line for accurate accounting.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_pord-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"procedural"}
{"instruction":"Why might the revenue balance not reflect expected changes after a PORD entry?","response":"The revenue balance may not reflect expected changes after a PORD entry due to several reasons. If the PORD line is associated with an incorrect SO line or if there are unprocessed invoices related to the SO, the accounting entries may not update correctly. Additionally, if there are prior entries that have been reversed or if there are discrepancies in the EXT_SLL_PRC value, these could also affect the final revenue balance.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_pord-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"What's the difference between PORD accounting entries for price decreases and price increases?","response":"The primary difference between PORD accounting entries for price decreases and increases lies in how they impact contract liability and revenue. For a price decrease, the accounting entries will typically show a decrease in revenue and an increase in contract liability. Conversely, for a price increase, the entries will show an increase in revenue and a corresponding increase in contract liability, thereby reflecting the overall change in the sales order value.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_pord-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"comparison"}
{"instruction":"Can you give an example of how PORD affects accounting entries for a price adjustment?","response":"Sure! For instance, if an initial sales order (SO) line of $100 is booked, it creates a corresponding liability and revenue entry. If the price is decreased to $50, a PORD entry will reflect a $50 decrease in revenue and a $50 increase in contract liability. After this adjustment, if an invoice line is collected for the adjusted amount, additional entries will recognize this change in both revenue and liability. This process illustrates how PORD entries dynamically adjust accounting records based on price changes.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_pord-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"example"}
{"instruction":"What is RORD in Zuora Revenue?","response":"RORD stands for Return Order and refers to a specific transaction type in Zuora Revenue that manages the accounting for returned products.

If disabled, you must first release the revenue for the parent line before collecting the RORD.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_rord-and-cm-ro-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"procedural"}
{"instruction":"Why might a Contra AR entry be created in Zuora Revenue?","response":"A Contra AR entry is created when the Net Billed Amount exceeds the Net Sell Price after a RORD line is collected. The Contra AR is calculated as the difference between the total billed amounts (invoices, credit memos, etc.) and the total sales amounts. This ensures that the financial records accurately represent the overbilling due to returns.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_rord-and-cm-ro-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"What's the difference between unbilled and billed Contract Liability in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Unbilled Contract Liability (CL with Unbill Flag = Y) represents amounts that have been recognized but not yet invoiced, while billed Contract Liability (CL with Unbill Flag = N) refers to amounts that have been invoiced and are now considered billed. The transition from unbilled to billed occurs when a CM-RO line is collected, reflecting the change in the revenue recognition process.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_rord-and-cm-ro-accounting-entries.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"comparison"}
{"instruction":"Can you give an example of RORD accounting entries after invoicing?","response":"An example of RORD accounting entries after invoicing would be if a customer returns a product that was previously invoiced.

{"instruction":"What is RORD in Zuora Revenue?","response":"RORD stands for 'Revenue Order Reduction' and is a transaction type used in Zuora Revenue to adjust previously recognized revenue. It typically occurs when there is a reduction in the revenue recognized for a sales order, allowing for the appropriate accounting adjustments to be made. In scenarios where both unbilled and billed contract liabilities exist, RORD will debit the unbilled contract liability.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_rord-and-cm-ro-accounting-entries_both-unbilled-and-billed-contract-liability-exist.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"definitional"}
{"instruction":"How do I analyze accounting entries for a RORD transaction?","response":"To analyze accounting entries for a RORD transaction in Zuora Revenue, first identify the transaction details, including the Line ID and amounts. Next, review the generated accounting entries, which will include debits and credits to 'Contract Liability (Unbilled)', 'Contract Liability (Billed)', and 'Revenue'.

{"instruction":"Why might there be both unbilled and billed contract liabilities for a transaction?","response":"Both unbilled and billed contract liabilities may exist for a transaction due to the timing of revenue recognition and invoicing. Typically, unbilled contract liabilities are recognized when a service is delivered but not yet invoiced, while billed contract liabilities arise when an invoice has been issued. In scenarios involving RORD or CM-RO adjustments, these liabilities may occur simultaneously as adjustments are made to reflect accurate revenue based on sales orders and invoices.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_rord-and-cm-ro-accounting-entries_both-unbilled-and-billed-contract-liability-exist.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"What's the difference between unbilled and billed contract liabilities in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Unbilled contract liabilities represent revenue that has been earned but not yet billed to the customer, indicating an obligation to deliver goods or services. In contrast, billed contract liabilities refer to revenue that has been recognized and invoiced, indicating that the customer has been billed but payment has not yet been received. Understanding the distinction is essential for accurate revenue recognition and financial reporting.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_rord-and-cm-ro-accounting-entries_both-unbilled-and-billed-contract-liability-exist.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"comparison"}
{"instruction":"Can you give an example of a scenario involving both unbilled and billed contract liabilities?","response":"An example scenario could involve a customer transaction where a sales order (SO) for $500 is created for a service delivered over a period. The service is invoiced, creating a billed contract liability of $250. However, as RORD transactions occur, adjustments are made that affect both unbilled and billed contract liabilities. For instance, if the RORD for the service results in an adjustment of $10 due to a net billed price being greater than the net sell price, both contract liabilities will be impacted, reflecting the adjustments to revenue recognition.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_rord-and-cm-ro-accounting-entries_both-unbilled-and-billed-contract-liability-exist.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"example"}
{"instruction":"What is a CM-C line in Zuora Revenue?","response":"A CM-C line in Zuora Revenue represents a credit memo for a customer, which is typically issued to adjust previously recognized revenue. It is used in scenarios where revenue needs to be reduced after an RORD (Return Order) line, affecting accounting entries such as Contract Liability and Contra AR. The CM-C line is processed to reverse certain accounting effects and recognize any related adjustments.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_accounting-behaviors-of-transaction-types_rord-and-cm-ro-accounting-entries_cm-c-line-collected-after-rord.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"definitional"}

{"instruction":"What is SSP normalization in Zuora Revenue?","response":"SSP normalization in Zuora Revenue refers to the process of adjusting the Standalone Selling Price (SSP) values of sales order (SO) lines based on the impact of reduction order (RORD) transactions. When a RORD line is collected, the SSP value of the original SO line is normalized considering the price, term, or quantity of the RORD line, thereby recalculating the Ext. SSP Price, Allocated, and Carve values accordingly.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_reduction-order-transactions_ssp-normalization.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"definitional"}
{"instruction":"How do I calculate the Ext. SSP Price based on percentage?","response":"To calculate the Ext. SSP Price based on percentage, multiply the Ext. List Price by the SSP percentage. For example, if the Ext. List Price is $1000 and the SSP% is 75, the calculation would be: Ext. SSP Price = 1000 * 75% = $750. This value is then used to derive Allocated and Carve values in conjunction with total amounts.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_reduction-order-transactions_ssp-normalization.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"procedural"}
{"instruction":"Why might my Ext. SSP Price not match my expectations after a RORD transaction?","response":"Your Ext. SSP Price might not match expectations after a RORD transaction due to several factors: an incorrect SSP percentage applied, an error in the Ext. List Price, or miscalculation of the quantity or term in relation to the RORD data. Ensure that all relevant fields are accurately updated and calculations are correctly applied based on the normalization rules.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_reduction-order-transactions_ssp-normalization.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"What's the difference between SSP based on percentage and SSP based on amount?","response":"The primary difference between SSP based on percentage and SSP based on amount lies in their calculation methods. SSP based on percentage is calculated by applying a percentage to the Ext. List Price (e.g., Ext. SSP Price = Ext. List Price * SSP%), while SSP based on amount involves a fixed SSP Price multiplied by the quantity and term (e.g., Ext. SSP Price = SSP Price * Quantity * Term). These methods affect how the Ext. SSP Price and related values are derived during normalization.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_reduction-order-transactions_ssp-normalization.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"comparison"}
{"instruction":"Can you give an example of how RORD impacts SSP normalization?","response":"For instance, consider an SO line with an Ext. SSP Price of $750 based on an Ext. List Price of $1000 and an SSP% of 75. If a RORD line reduces the quantity by 1, the new Ext. List Price for the SO line may decrease, leading to a recalculated Ext. SSP Price of $375 (based on the new Ext. List Price of $500). The Allocated value will also adjust accordingly, demonstrating how RORD directly influences the normalization of SSP values.","source":"zuora-revenue/data-management_transaction-processing_reduction-order-transactions_ssp-normalization.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"example"}

{"instruction":"Why might a child POB not have any amortization entries?","response":"A child POB will not have any amortization entries if the release percentage of its parent POB is 0. This means that revenue cannot be released for the child POB until the parent POB starts releasing revenue. If the parent POB has not begun releasing revenue, the child POB remains deferred and cannot process any associated revenue.","source":"zuora-revenue/getting-started_policy-management_performance-obligations-processing_pob-dependency.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"What's the difference between 'Upon Start' and 'Upon Booking' in POB dependency?","response":"'Upon Start' is a dependency type that triggers the release of a child POB's revenue only when the associated parent POB begins to release revenue. In contrast, 'Upon Booking' means that the child POB will remain in a deferred state until the parent POB line is released. The key difference lies in when the revenue release for the child POB is initiated, with 'Upon Start' being contingent on the parent's revenue release.","source":"zuora-revenue/getting-started_policy-management_performance-obligations-processing_pob-dependency.md","product":"zuora-revenue","category":"comparison"}
{"instruction":"Can you give an example of using POB dependency in a revenue contract?","response":"For instance, consider a revenue contract with two sequential performance obligations: a 'Software License' (parent POB) and 'Implementation Services' (child POB). The implementation services can only start recognizing revenue once the customer has access to the software license.
