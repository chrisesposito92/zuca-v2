    "use_case_description": "Customer signs a 12-month observability agreement anchored on Infrastructure Monitoring (Enterprise) with a committed baseline of 500 hosts at $23/host/month (list), billed monthly in advance but committed for the full annual term. The Infra rate plan also includes a separate usage/overage charge for any host-hours above the 500-host commitment, priced at the on-demand equivalent of $27/host/month (modeled as a usage charge rated monthly from host-hour consumption). Starting in month 7 (a mid-term upgrade / contract modification), the customer adds 200 more committed Infra hosts (bringing the baseline to 700) and also adds APM at 150 APM hosts at $31/APM host/month (list), billed monthly for the remainder of the term with proration from the effective date. APM also includes monthly usage overages billed in arrears: $1.70 per million indexed spans and $0.10 per GB ingested spans beyond included allotments (modeled as separate usage charges). In the same month-7 upgrade, the customer adds Log Management usage charges for ongoing consumption billed monthly in arrears: Log Ingest at $0.10/GB and Standard Indexing at $1.70 per million events (billed-annually rates used as list for the demo). Commercially, the seller applies a 12% bundle discount to the fixed recurring components (Infra committed hosts + APM host subscription) starting at the upgrade effective date; usage overages remain undiscounted and bill at list. Revenue expectation (inferred): fixed SaaS subscription components recognized ratably over the service period; usage/overage charges recognized as consumption occurs; the mid-term upgrade is treated as a contract modification that may require reallocation across remaining performance obligations depending on SSP and modification treatment."

      "[BLOCKING] Does the 12% bundle discount starting 2026-07-01 apply to (a) the entire post-upgrade fixed recurring baseline (all 700 Infra hosts + APM hosts) or (b) only the incremental adds (200 Infra + new APM)? (Affects transaction price, allocation, and revenue.)",
      "[HIGH] How should the Infra committed baseline be represented for months 7–12: a single 700-host recurring line, or two lines (continuation of 500 + incremental 200)? (Affects amendment structure, allocation pools, and reporting.)",
      "[HIGH] For usage revenue recognition, do you require consumption/event-driven recognition (usage events) or invoice-driven recognition for APM/Logs/Infra overages? (Determines POB mapping and integration requirements.)",
      "[HIGH] Should any expected/estimated usage (variable consideration) be included in the transaction price at booking (subject to constraint), or should all usage remain excluded until billed/consumed? (Affects allocation and revenue timing.)",
      "[HIGH] Confirm Infra overage rating details: unit of measure (host-hour vs host-month), whether strictly billed in arrears, and the hours-per-month conversion convention (actual hours by month vs fixed 720/730). (Affects invoicing accuracy and usage revenue amounts.)",
      "[HIGH] Were there any included/bundled allotments for APM indexed spans, APM ingested spans, log ingest (GB), and log indexing (million events) that define what qualifies as “overage”? (Affects usage charge quantities and customer invoicing.)",
      "[HIGH] Provide actual consumption inputs (or dated usage events) for Infra overage host-hours and APM/Logs usage metrics for Jul–Dec 2026 (and earlier months for Infra overage if applicable). (Required to compute usage billings and event-driven revenue schedules.)",
      "[MEDIUM] Confirm the actual upgrade effective date/time. If not exactly 2026-07-01 (e.g., mid-month), should July 2026 recurring charges be prorated, and what proration policy applies? (Affects July billing and revenue schedules.)",
      "[MEDIUM] For in-arrears invoicing, do invoices date on the service period end date (e.g., 2026-07-31) or the next day/next period start (e.g., 2026-08-01) based on your Zuora bill run schedule? (Affects invoice dating, accounting period cutoffs, and revenue/billing alignment.)"
