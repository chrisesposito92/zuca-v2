{"instruction":"What do the values 'L' and 'R' represent in the 'Accounting Type' field of the Unbilled Fx Report?","response":"The values 'L' and 'R' in the Accounting Type field of the Unbilled Fx Report typically relate to your specific accounting type setup configuration. You should review the accounting type setup in your environment to confirm what these specific codes map to for your implementation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR data migration require specific handling for subscriptions with a large number of versions (e.g., >200)?","response":"If the data is standard out-of-the-box (OOTB), specific issues are not anticipated solely due to version count. However, challenges often arise from data quality issues, such as owner transfers or account deletions occurring over those versions. If issues arise during migration, a support ticket should be raised for engineering assistance.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Can Revenue GL fields on the ProductRatePlanCharge (PRPC) be updated via API?","response":"Yes, you can update the revenue GL accounts on the PRPC using the PUT API endpoint: `https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/operation/PUT_RevProAccountingCodes/`.","category":"procedural","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"How are discounts handled in OTR, specifically regarding mapping to GL accounts and charges?","response":"In OTR, a Discount charge is treated as part of the regular charge it applies to. There are settings to allow Discounts to use their own GL accounts and dates. If you require the discount to be treated as a completely separate distinct charge with different behavior, you may need to use a non-discount charge type. For mapping, fields like `ApplyToSubscriptionID` or `Discount Applied to Rate Plan Charge` in the Booking Transaction object can be used to establish relationships.","category":"definitional","topic":"Discounts"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended solution for a customer with a single OTR tenant selling in multiple functional currencies (e.g., USD and EUR) across different entities?","response":"The recommended solution for handling multiple functional currencies across different entities (e.g., US and Ireland) is to use Multi-Org in Zuora Billing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected CCV for pending charges if 'Generate all charges' is selected for Booking Transaction generation?","response":"Currently, the CCV for pending charges remains zero. A feature to provide estimated CCV based on estimated dates is in development but not yet available as of early 2025.","category":"definitional","topic":"CCV Calculation"}
{"instruction":"How is CCV calculated if a Fixed Amount Discount (FAD) is removed from a subscription?","response":"If a FAD is removed (e.g., from the beginning), the regular charge CCV reflects the full amount, and the FAD charge CCV will reflect only the discount amount that was actually billed prior to removal.","category":"definitional","topic":"CCV Calculation"}
{"instruction":"Can BookingTransaction and BillingTransaction objects be extracted from Zuora Billing to a Data Warehouse?","response":"Yes, these objects can be extracted to a data warehouse using an AQUA query.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Extraction"}
{"instruction":"Should custom fields for revenue reporting be mapped to the Booking or Billing transaction object?","response":"It depends on the specific use case. For example, if you are using standalone invoicing to form a revenue contract, fields should be mapped to the Billing Transaction object. The mapping location should align with the object driving the revenue logic.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Is Multi-Currency supported for K2 customers?","response":"No, Multi-Currency is not supported in the RevProIntegrationV2 (K2) environment. Customers must onboard with Order to Revenue (OTR) to utilize the Multi-Currency feature.","category":"comparison","topic":"Multi-Currency"}
{"instruction":"What steps should be taken to troubleshoot a subscription that fails to sync to Revenue?","response":"To troubleshoot sync issues: 1. Use Data Query to confirm data generated in Billing. 2. Check logs to see if the `SOLineId` was sent to Sunergy (Revenue integration layer). 3. Query the `zb_uno_event` table for `sent_on` and `received_on` timestamps. 4. Verify if Sunergy received the transaction.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sync Troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"Does enabling Invoice Item Settlement (IIS) impact OTR?","response":"No, OTR supports both Invoice Item Adjustment (IIA) and Invoice Settlement (IS). IIS relates to how payments apply to billing documents and does not negatively impact OTR.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"Can reconciliation tables (e.g., RPRO_UNO_RECON_*) be exposed to customers for Data Warehouse reporting?","response":"No, these are temporary internal tables and should not be exposed. Customers should extract the standard `BookingTransaction` and `BillingTransaction` objects from Billing to build their own reconciliation or reporting views.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Reconciliation"}
{"instruction":"Can prepayment charges flow into revenue as usage charges instead of 'Upon Event'?","response":"Typically, a prepayment charge represents cash on account (liability) and is not itself revenue. The revenue recognition event is triggered by the consumption (usage) items that draw down that balance.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepaid"}
{"instruction":"Does performing a suspend and resume action on the same day create a new charge segment?","response":"If the relevant permission is enabled, suspend and resume actions on the same day will split the segment. The system generally defaults to using enhanced CCV logic.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"What should be checked if a user cannot access or save OTR Settings?","response":"Check the user role permissions. The \"Manage OTR Settings\" privilege must be enabled. If the standard Administrator role does not have this visible, you may need to create a new custom role with this specific permission enabled.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Permissions"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support 'prepaid cash with drawdown' and does it impact revenue?","response":"Prepaid cash with drawdown is primarily a payment/collection feature and does not directly affect revenue. Revenue is driven by the orders and subsequent consumption/usage.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepaid"}
{"instruction":"How is the estimated end date derived for recurring charges on evergreen subscriptions in OTR?","response":"In OTR, the estimated end date for evergreen subscriptions is typically calculated as the current term plus one additional Billing Period (BP).","category":"definitional","topic":"Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"Is the API to regenerate booking transactions public?","response":"Yes, the Regenerate API is public. Documentation is available under the 'Regenerate' tag in the API reference.","category":"definitional","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"How does the backfill utility handle revenue fields for Product Rate Plan Charges (PRPC) versus Invoice Items?","response":"The auto-backfill utility copies revenue field values from the PRPC to the Rate Plan Charge (RPC) and Order Line Item (OLI). It does *not* automatically update Invoice Items or Memo Items; flags for those must be updated manually if needed.","category":"procedural","topic":"Backfill"}
{"instruction":"What happens to OTR settings when a Revenue Sandbox is refreshed from Production?","response":"If OTR is not enabled in the source Production environment, refreshing the Sandbox will reset the OTR settings (profiles). OTR settings are not automatically preserved if the source does not have them.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"Is it supported to change the Bill Cycle Day (BCD) for an OTR customer?","response":"Changing BCD is generally complex in OTR. However, if the BCD change occurs alongside a Terms & Conditions (T&C) order action (e.g., switching from monthly to annual on a new date), it is supported. The first CCV will use the billed amount.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Bill Cycle Day"}
{"instruction":"Can custom fields on the Contact object be mapped to Revenue?","response":"It is not recommended to map custom fields from the Contact object because updates to contact fields are not automatically synced to Revenue, which can lead to reporting inconsistencies. It is better to use snapshot fields (like Bill To/Sold To) or capture the data at the Subscription level.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How can historical unbilled usage be migrated to Revenue?","response":"Historical data cannot be converted to unbilled usage during migration. A common workaround is to perform a consumption upload to release the revenue for those historical periods.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"What is the logic for 'Sales Order Line ID' and 'Sales Order Line Number' in the Booking Transaction object?","response":"The `Sales Order Line ID` maps to the original Rate Plan Charge (RPC) Segment ID. The `Sales Order Line Number` maps to the Charge Number.","category":"definitional","topic":"Booking Transaction"}
{"instruction":"Does the inline discount functionality support Pay-As-You-Go (PayGo) usage?","response":"Yes, inline discounts support unbilled usage (PayGo) and PPDD (Prepaid with Drawdown), but they do not support committed usage models.","category":"definitional","topic":"Discounts"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'Before Validate' and 'Before Bundle Explode' stages in Data Augmentation?","response":"'Before Validate' runs before validation logic on the source data. 'Before Bundle Explode' runs after validation but before the bundle is exploded; this stage is useful for applying generic manipulations that should trickle down to parent and child lines to avoid duplicating efforts.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Augmentation"}
{"instruction":"How does OTR Data Migration determine which subscriptions and charges to migrate based on the cutover date?","response":"Migration selects subscriptions where the cutover date falls between the Term Start and Term End dates. For selected subscriptions, charges active in that term (and their history, if amended) are migrated. If a recurring charge is active in the current term but was added in a previous term, its history is also included.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"What are the default values for 'Allocation Eligible' and 'Right To Bill' revenue flags?","response":"The default value for these flags is 'No'. This is intentional to force a detailed analysis during enablement. You can use the data backfill tool to update these fields on the Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC).","category":"procedural","topic":"Configuration"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended order for enabling Invoice Settlement (IS) and OTR?","response":"While they are independent, for existing customers undergoing billing modernization, it is recommended to enable and validate Invoice Settlement (IS) first before proceeding with OTR data migration.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Enablement"}
{"instruction":"Should allocation be enabled for standalone/adhoc Credit Memos in OTR?","response":"It is generally recommended to disable allocation for standalone Credit Memos, as these are typically used for write-offs or goodwill and should not impact the original booking allocation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"Is unposting invoices supported in OTR?","response":"Unposting invoices is strongly discouraged and often disabled in OTR because it causes 'double invoicing' issues in Revenue (original + reversal + new invoice). The recommended practice is to use Invoice Reversal or Invoice Item Adjustments.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR Data Migration support evergreen subscriptions?","response":"Yes, evergreen subscriptions participate in data migration as long as they are active (effective end date is blank/open).","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"What should be done if the 'Change Plan' order action is needed in an OTR-enabled tenant, given that documentation suggests it might not be supported?","response":"While some documentation (specifically regarding K2 integration) states that 'Change Plan' is not supported, OTR (Order to Revenue) does support the 'Change Plan' order action. The confusion often arises because documentation for K2 (Billing-Revenue Integration) lists it as unsupported. If an error like 'change plan is not supported' occurs, it may be because K2 permissions are still active. To resolve this, ensure that the tenant is correctly configured for OTR and that K2 permissions are disabled if OTR is the intended integration method. You should confirm with the support or engineering team that the tenant settings are correct.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"OTR Order Actions"}
{"instruction":"How should credit card surcharges be handled in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Credit card surcharges are typically considered a reduction in cost or a separate fee and do not integrate natively into Zuora Revenue as standard revenue items. They usually generate a debit memo (DM). If the 'Exclude Item from Revenue Accounting' flag is not configured, the surcharge (as a DM) and any subsequent refunds or write-offs may flow to revenue, which is often not the desired behavior. The recommended approach is often to exclude these transactions from revenue accounting via the exclude flags. If a refund occurs, unapplying the payment and refunding both the surcharge and the original invoice is the standard process, where the surcharge DM is automatically written off.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Credit Card Surcharges"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to support usage-based credits or 'SLA' style credits based on transaction volume in OTR?","response":"For usage-based credits (e.g., SLA penalties or volume-based rebates), Zuora Billing supports creating a usage charge with a negative per-unit price (e.g., 250 transactions @ -0.03 = -$7.50). This results in a negative charge that can be processed. However, typically revenue cannot recognize usage charges that are negative directly as standard usage. Mediation can calculate the credit, but the resulting negative usage charge needs to be handled carefully. It effectively acts as a rebate or reduction in transaction fees.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Credits"}
{"instruction":"Why does the error 'Amount Based Events is Not Supported only for Recurring charges' occur when sending One Time charges with amount-based event release?","response":"This error occurs because Amount Based Events are generally designed for recurring charges in the standard configuration. If you are attempting to use them for One Time charges in an OTR instance, you may encounter this limitation. This is often a configuration or product limitation that requires verification with the Revenue product team.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Amount Based Events"}
{"instruction":"How can I fix the 'No Open Periods' error in Zuora Revenue after creating a new Org and mapping it, while the Default Org works fine?","response":"If you create a new Org in Revenue and map it to Billing entities, but see 'No Open Periods', you likely need to open the periods for that specific new Org in the Revenue Console. If the Default Org works but the new one doesn't, ensure the new Org is active and periods are explicitly opened for it. If you revert to the Default Org, you may need to adjust the Org mapping in Billing. However, editing Org mapping in Billing might be restricted after initial setup, requiring a support ticket to redo the mapping.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Org Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Will the new pending orders functionality work in Revenue if a customer is on Order Harmony (OH)?","response":"Yes, if a customer is on Order Harmony (OH), the new pending orders functionality should work in Revenue, provided the customer is using Orders within OH.","category":"definitional","topic":"Order Harmony"}
{"instruction":"What are the requirements for merging an OTR-enabled child entity with Zuora Revenue (Multi-Entity)?","response":"When merging entities in a Multi-Entity hierarchy where OTR is involved, the OTR setting must be enabled at the Global entity level. Both Global and Child entities should use a single integration method (OTR) and should not mix K2 and OTR. If migrating data to a new entity, ensure the global settings are correct.","category":"procedural","topic":"Multi-Entity Merge"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'Split Segment' setting recommended for ZB-ZR integration in OTR?","response":"Yes, the recommendation is to keep 'Split Segment' ON in OTR. Turning it OFF carries risks regarding how segments and revenue are handled, so enabling it is the standard best practice.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Split Segment"}
{"instruction":"How can I link CM-ROs (Credit Memo - Revenue Operations) to original Invoice transactions on the ZR side to fix exchange rate inheritance issues?","response":"In credit proration scenarios (e.g., remove product amendment), CM-ROs might inherit exchange rates from Sales Orders instead of the originating Invoices, causing FX differences. While this issue is addressed in the Q2 release, if you need to analyze the data or link them manually for impact analysis, there isn't a direct standard link exposed easily for end-users to modify FX inheritance without the fix. The system logic typically defaults to LIFO (Last In First Out) for credit memos against bookings.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Does pre-rated usage sent to Zuora Billing cause issues in Revenue for OTR customers not using SSP?","response":"Pre-rated usage sent to Billing acts as an unbilled usage upload. It generally has no negative impact on Revenue in OTR. It flows through as usage data.","category":"definitional","topic":"Pre-rated Usage"}
{"instruction":"Can I modify seeded POB templates (e.g., 'Upon Order Activation Ratable') to add VC types?","response":"You should not modify or make copies of seeded POB templates. The best practice is to create a new POB template from scratch if you need specific configurations like Variable Consideration (VC) or different cost rules, rather than trying to enable them on the seeded templates.","category":"best_practice","topic":"POB Templates"}
{"instruction":"Why are exchange rates missing in Revenue for booking transactions even if they are loaded in Billing for the order date?","response":"If exchange rates are loaded in Billing but not flowing to Revenue booking transactions, it may be a system sync issue or a specific bug (e.g., missing exchange rate issue on charges). In such cases, regenerating the booking transaction often does not fix it if the underlying sync failed. A support ticket is usually required to investigate why the rates didn't propagate.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Is 'Billing Based Revenue Recognition' a valid option for new OTR customers?","response":"While Billing-based revenue recognition allows for accurate accounting by processing only invoices, it is generally not recommended for new OTR customers. The feature exists primarily to support existing K2 customers transitioning to OTR. New OTR customers should rely on the standard OTR booking/billing flows.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing Based Rev Rec"}
{"instruction":"How can I update OTR fields (like 'Exclude from Revenue') to be blank/null via data backfill if the system returns a 'value is required' error?","response":"If you are trying to exclude a Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) from revenue using data backfill, you do not need to populate all other OTR fields. You can simply provide the Charge ID and set the 'Exclude Item Booking from Revenue Accounting' and 'Exclude Item Billing from Revenue Accounting' columns to 'True'. You do not need to set other fields to blank; omitting them or focusing on the exclude flags is sufficient.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Backfill"}
{"instruction":"Why is usage uploaded in Billing not syncing to Revenue (rpro_daily_cnsmp_prestg_g table)?","response":"If usage is uploaded in Billing but not appearing in Revenue, check if 'Unbill Usage' is enabled. After enabling it, a migration by the engineering team might be required. Also, verify if the Daily Consumption object in DSE has values. Large data volumes in other tenants can sometimes cause processing delays (lag) in the shared environment.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Sync"}
{"instruction":"What is the source field for 'BookingTransaction.CurrentELP'?","response":"'BookingTransaction.CurrentELP' (Extended List Price) is calculated by OTR and does not have a direct source field in Billing. It is derived. If you see a $0 ELP where you expect a value, check the 'Original List Price' in the order action. If the list price in the Product Catalog (PRPC) is 0, you must set the 'originalListPrice' field in the Orders call to ensure the correct override value is used for calculation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Booking Transaction Fields"}
{"instruction":"Why are Revenue accounts missing in the Product Catalog UI for an OTR tenant?","response":"This is a known UI issue that can sometimes be related to VPN or network settings (e.g., Zscaler policies). Disconnecting from the VPN or updating Zscaler policies often resolves the visibility of Revenue accounts in the Billing UI. Alternatively, you can verify the fields exist via a data query or use data backfill to update them if the UI is blocked.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Product Catalog UI"}
{"instruction":"How does multi-currency behave in Zuora Revenue with OTR?","response":"In OTR, multi-currency support allows users to have multiple transaction currencies at the subscription or OLI level. There is no major change in how OTR or ZR works compared to standard logic; the system uses the transaction currency from the subscription. The major experience change is in Billing (capturing currencies at the sub level), while Revenue consumes the data as provided.","category":"definitional","topic":"Multi-Currency"}
{"instruction":"Can we execute a 'Change Plan' order action in OTR?","response":"Yes, OTR supports the 'Change Plan' order action. The limitation often cited in documentation refers to K2 (Billing-Revenue Integration), not OTR.","category":"definitional","topic":"Change Plan"}
{"instruction":"How can we migrate Product Catalog Revenue Accounting fields in an OTR implementation?","response":"Deployment Manager does not support migrating Revenue Accounting fields. The recommended approach is to use the Data Loader (Update Product Rate Plan Charge template). You can update fields like 'AllocationEligible', 'RevenueRecognitionTiming', 'RevenueAmortizationMethod', and 'Exclude' flags. The 'Right to Bill Flag' corresponds to the 'IsUnbilled' field in the PRPC API.","category":"procedural","topic":"Product Catalog Migration"}
{"instruction":"Is there a dashboard to monitor OTR connector performance?","response":"Currently, there is no customer-facing health dashboard for the OTR connector (unlike the Salesforce connector). The sync is designed to be near real-time. Performance monitoring is managed internally by the Product/Engineering teams.","category":"definitional","topic":"OTR Performance"}
{"instruction":"How can we split revenue between a partner and company account for the same subscription in OTR?","response":"The best approach is to use separate GL accounts rather than a bundle upload. Create a subscription with multiple usage charges—one for the partner and one for the company. When usage is uploaded, it will automatically take the GL account associated with the respective charge, splitting the revenue automatically during processing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Revenue Split"}
{"instruction":"Can we continue to run the ZBilling Revenue Detail Report after enabling OTR?","response":"Generally, enabling OTR turns off ZBilling Revenue capabilities. However, some customers want ZBilling to create Revenue Schedules for reporting (Revenue Detail Report) without creating Journal Entries. This is a specific configuration question, but typically OTR replaces ZBilling revenue recognition.","category":"definitional","topic":"ZBilling Reports"}
{"instruction":"Can we map custom fields to both RPC and OLI using the same attribute (e.g., ATR1) in OTR billing templates?","response":"In the Booking template, you can map the same attribute (ATR1) to custom fields on both RPC and OLI. However, in the Billing template, once an attribute is mapped to an RPC custom field, it may not be available for mapping to the OLI object. This is a known limitation in the Billing template mapping.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How should 'Usage Charges' be handled in OTR for consumption revenue?","response":"Usage charges should ideally be handled using the Consumption revenue model. Using standard usage charges with manually created POBs is not recommended. If you have a consumption use case (e.g., active prospect with free units and overage), use the standard Consumption POBs rather than custom ones. The system defaults the list price on usage charges to $0 in some contexts, so rely on the consumption/mediation flow.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Charges"}
{"instruction":"Can we update custom fields on an invoice line after it has been collected in Revenue?","response":"No, updates to billing transactions (like invoice lines) are not allowed after they are collected. You cannot simply update the field and sync it. The workaround is usually to regenerate the booking/billing transactions if the period is open, but if already collected and processed, you may need to unapply/reverse or use a custom solution (which is difficult). Direct updates are blocked.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Invoice Updates"}
{"instruction":"What is the 'Right to Bill Flag' in the Product Rate Plan Charge API?","response":"The 'Right to Bill Flag' corresponds to the `IsUnbilled` field in the Product Rate Plan Charge API.","category":"definitional","topic":"API Fields"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support Invoice Adjustments (IA)?","response":"OTR only supports Invoice Item Adjustments. It does not support header-level Invoice Adjustments. If a customer needs adjustments, they must be at the line item level.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Adjustments"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle a scenario where a manually created Credit Memo (CM) was applied to an invoice but a second CM was automatically generated?","response":"If a manually created CM (standalone) is applied, and the system also generates a CM (e.g., from an invoice reversal or similar action), you may end up with duplicates in Revenue. The recommended approach is to identify which CM is valid for revenue. If the second CM (CM2) is invalid or duplicate, you should write it off or purge it from the stage (if not collected). Ensure only the valid revenue-impacting CM is processed.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"What are the limitations of OTR regarding 'Terms and Conditions' changes (Decreasing/Increasing Term)?","response":"There are known limitations when changing terms in OTR, specifically 'Decreasing term' and 'Increasing term when billing in advance'. If a term decrease occurs on an invoiced segment, a CM-C (Credit Memo-Cancellation) is generated. If the term creates a new segment, Billing might extend the segment instead, resulting in a CM-C that never gets a corresponding CM-RO (Revenue Operations) from upstream, leading to sync issues.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Term Changes"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support 'Change Plan' order actions?","response":"Yes, OTR supports 'Change Plan' order actions. Documentation stating it is unsupported refers to K2 (Legacy Billing-Revenue Integration).","category":"definitional","topic":"Change Plan"}
{"instruction":"How can I exclude specific billing items (Invoices, CMs) from Revenue in OTR?","response":"You can exclude specific billing items using the `Exclude Item Billing from Revenue Accounting` flag. This flag is available on Credit Memos (CMs) and Invoices via API. It allows you to prevent specific transactions from flowing to Revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"Revenue Exclusion"}
{"instruction":"What should be done if a 'Split Segment' is required for OTR?","response":"It is strongly recommended to keep 'Split Segment' ON in OTR configurations to ensure proper revenue handling and avoid risks associated with segment processing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Split Segment"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support the 'Reflect Discount in Apply To Charge Net Amount' setting for Per Unit Pricing models?","response":"Currently, the event-based revenue recognition in OTR (which uses `Reflect Discount in Apply To Charge Net Amount`) primarily supports Delivery Pricing and Daily Consumption models. Support for Per Unit Pricing models with this specific discount reflection setting in OTR is limited or requires verification of the specific use case (often not supported out of the box).","category":"definitional","topic":"Discount Settings"}
{"instruction":"How do I map the 'Invoice Owner' to the 'Customer' field in Revenue for booking transactions?","response":"OTR maps the Subscription Owner as the Customer in Revenue by default. Mapping the Invoice Owner is possible but not ideal; standard mapping allows Name and Account Number. Standard attributes on the Invoice Owner might not be fully available for mapping to the Customer field in Revenue without custom configuration or workarounds.","category":"procedural","topic":"Customer Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How can I monitor the sync delay or 'lag' between Billing and Revenue in OTR?","response":"There is no customer-facing dashboard for sync lag yet (ticket UNO-3862 tracks this). You can check the 'Data Source' in Revenue to see if Booking/Billing transactions exist. If they exist in Data Source but not in Revenue Stage/Tables, there is a lag in ingestion. If they don't exist in Data Source, you can use the 'Regenerate' API to force the transaction generation.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sync Lag"}
{"instruction":"Is 'Order Owner Transfer' supported in OTR?","response":"Yes, Subscription Owner Transfer triggers a booking transaction update in Revenue (often seen as a version update). However, Invoice Owner Transfer does not trigger a booking transaction update in Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"Owner Transfer"}
{"instruction":"Can I map the 'Relative Invoice' (or Related Invoice) field on a Credit Memo to Revenue?","response":"Currently, the 'Related Invoice' field on a Credit Memo is not natively exposed for mapping in the standard OTR integration. You can map `BillingTransaction.InvoiceId` for the Credit Memo, but the specific 'Related Invoice' number field requires a product enhancement (User story UNO-3796 exists for this).","category":"definitional","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Can we set a future target date for evergreen subscriptions to generate a single invoice and SO update?","response":"Yes, using a future dated target date for evergreen subscriptions is supported and typically results in a single invoice in the system, which is the expected behavior.","category":"procedural","topic":"Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How can we avoid revenue staging duplication during evergreen subscription migration if the automation tool triggers draft invoices for every order?","response":"This issue often stems from automation tooling triggering the invoice API for every order, creating multiple booking transactions. The recommended approach is to verify where the migration flag is applied and, if possible, load all accounts and orders first before running the Bill Run API at the end. Even if the Bill Run is invoked per order, it should be scoped to the specific subscription.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Is there a direct link between the OTR stage table and the Order Line Item (OLI) object?","response":"Yes, for OTR customers, you can link the stage table to the Order Line Item object by joining the `salesorderlineid` in the stage table with the `salesorderlineid` in the booking transaction, which matches the ID in the Order Line Item object.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Model"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for refreshing an OTR environment to ensure data consistency?","response":"It is recommended to refresh both the billing and revenue environments to avoid data inconsistency. If you need to revert a sandbox to a specific state (e.g., non-OTR matching Production), a refresh from Production will copy the relevant permissions and data.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Environment Management"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'Consume Deleted Transaction' setting affect deleted orders or amendments in OTR?","response":"If `CONSUME_DELETED_TRANSACTION` is disabled, deleted transactions may cause errors or remain in the inbound stage. Enabling it allows the system to process these deletions. Note that the 'Delete Amendment' feature for OTR is targeted for a future release (2025.Q4). Generally, deleting orders is not recommended; best practice is to use de-book/rebook or invoice reversals.","category":"definitional","topic":"Deleted Transactions"}
{"instruction":"Which date is used to derive the exchange rate in OTR integration?","response":"OTR integration typically uses the Invoice Date (Document Date) to derive the exchange rate.","category":"definitional","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Can we map custom fields from both Invoice and Credit Memo objects to the same ATR field in Revenue?","response":"Directly mapping custom fields from both Invoice and Credit Memo objects to the same ATR field at the object level is not supported. However, mapping is allowed for Invoice Items and Credit Memo Items. For OTR, mapping RPC and OLI to the same ATR is supported. To map fields like 'Ship To Country' to standard Revenue fields, they must typically be mapped to a revenue attribute first.","category":"procedural","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'Order Upgrade with Invoice Settlement' feature mandatory for OTR?","response":"No, Order and Invoice Settlement are independent features. OTR supports Subscribe/Amend, Orders, and Invoice Settlement.","category":"definitional","topic":"OTR Requirements"}
{"instruction":"How are FX rates handled for future-dated orders if the rate is not yet available?","response":"Booking transaction FX rates are calculated at the time of generation and do not auto-regenerate. It is recommended to not use future dates for the Order/Booking date; instead, use the current date and set the Effective Date to the future. If transactions fail due to missing rates, you may need to load rates into Revenue manually.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Do Booking and Billing Transaction objects automatically update when an Order is deleted?","response":"No, if the booking or billing transaction has already been generated, it will not be automatically deleted when the upstream Order is deleted.","category":"definitional","topic":"Transaction Sync"}
{"instruction":"Can we group subscriptions from different Billing orgs into a single Revenue Contract?","response":"Yes, if the Revenue tenant is single-org, you can group subscriptions from different Billing orgs into one revenue contract using a common attribute. Be aware that allocations and modifications across different company codes may trigger intercompany accounting entries.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"Can Invoice Item Adjustments (IIA) be regenerated and synced to Revenue?","response":"Yes, IIAs are supported in OTR. You can use the Billing Transaction regeneration API to sync them. Note that Tax IIAs generally do not sync to revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"Transaction Regeneration"}
{"instruction":"Why might there be a small discrepancy between Invoice TCV and Sales Order CCV in migrated data?","response":"TCV does not sync to revenue. Discrepancies between Invoice TCV and Sales Order CCV in migrated data are often due to specific bugs or data inconsistencies which should be reported to support.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Consistency"}
{"instruction":"Why does a subscription cancellation sometimes not create a booking transaction in Revenue?","response":"If a subscription is cancelled effective on its original term end date (natural end), it is treated as a non-impacting event and no booking transaction is generated. Cancellations effectively before the term end (early termination) should generate booking transactions.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Cancellation"}
{"instruction":"Why are booking transactions failing to sync to Revenue despite being generated in Billing?","response":"This can occur due to mapping issues. For example, a mismatch in field length for `FV_ELIGIBLE_FLAG` (Billing sending 'true'/'false' vs Revenue expecting 1 char) has been known to cause sync failures.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sync Errors"}
{"instruction":"How is Extended List Price (ELP) calculated for Prepayment charges?","response":"For prepayment charges, there is no proration. The ELP is calculated as the full amount for the validity period.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepayment"}
{"instruction":"How do we map the Invoice Number for a Credit Memo Item in OTR?","response":"You can map `INV.invoice number` in the billing transaction mapping to a revenue attribute to capture the invoice number for credit memo items.","category":"procedural","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support single version subscriptions?","response":"Yes, OTR supports single version subscriptions. However, there have been reported issues with fields like Product Family or Rev Rec Timing being blank in Booking Transactions for these subscriptions, which may require a fix.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"Can usage revenue be recognized prior to invoicing (Right to Bill)?","response":"Yes. This requires a pure usage charge and a POB template set to 'Consumption Usage (Non-Comitted)'. You must also run the 'Process Usage to Revenue conversion' (Usage Master process) to recognize the revenue prior to billing.","category":"procedural","topic":"Usage Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What are best practices for OTR Data Migration?","response":"Key best practices include: establishing a pre/post-migration reconciliation framework; batching data collection (e.g., 1M-5M records); ensuring accounting codes are unique (duplicates can block backfill); and monitoring for performance (subscriptions take longer than invoices). For testing subsets of data (mocks), consider using the Regenerate API instead of the full Data Migration job.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can we update FX rates for an invoice if they were missing during initial generation?","response":"You can use the regenerate API with the parameter `remigrate=true`. This purges the existing booking/billing transactions and rebuilds them, which should pick up the newly available FX rates.","category":"procedural","topic":"Transaction Regeneration"}
{"instruction":"How is the 'Semi-Annual' billing period handled in OTR mapping?","response":"There is a known issue where 'Semi-Annual' may be translated to 'Semi_Annual' (with an underscore). Until fixed, you may need Data Augmentation (DA) rules to handle both value formats.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Billing Period"}
{"instruction":"Can we map custom fields from a Usage record in Billing to Revenue?","response":"Currently, direct mapping of custom fields from usage records to Revenue is not supported. Workarounds include using the revenue upload functionality or deriving values from other available attributes.","category":"definitional","topic":"Usage Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle duplicate accounting codes blocking OTR backfill?","response":"Duplicate accounting codes (e.g., one active, one inactive with the same name) can cause backfill validation failures. The recommended workaround is to rename the inactive code if possible. A platform enhancement is planned to respect the active/inactive status.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Accounting Codes"}
{"instruction":"How can we create a Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) with revenue fields via API?","response":"If the create API does not support revenue fields directly, you can: 1. Set 'Allow Blank Accounting Codes' to Yes; 2. Create the PRPC; 3. Use the `PUT_RevProAccountingCodes` endpoint to set the revenue fields; 4. Revert the 'Allow Blank Accounting Codes' setting.","category":"procedural","topic":"API Usage"}
{"instruction":"Is it recommended to close accounting periods in Zuora Billing for OTR?","response":"Yes, it is highly recommended to close accounting periods in Billing to ensure no transactions are created in closed periods, which facilitates accurate auditing and revenue reconciliation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Accounting Periods"}
{"instruction":"Which Fixed Amount Discount (FAD) allocation option supports allocation at the FAD-line level?","response":"Option 2 (Generate Actual value in Booking Transaction) or Option 4 (Generate Actual Amount as a Standalone Booking Line) are suitable for line-level allocation. However, Option 2 may have limitations with usage or evergreen subscriptions.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Fixed Amount Discounts"}
{"instruction":"Does data migration include subscriptions created between the cutoff date and the migration run?","response":"Data migration is typically based on a 'From Date'. It generally includes all active and evergreen subscriptions relevant to that start date range.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Does the regenerate API bring in all versions of a subscription?","response":"The regenerate API brings in 'impacted' SO lines where revenue-impacting fields have changed. If a version change does not affect revenue fields, a corresponding line might not be generated.","category":"definitional","topic":"Transaction Regeneration"}
{"instruction":"Why do Fixed Amount Discount (FAD) revenue dates not update upon cancellation?","response":"FAD revenue dates typically flow blindly from billing or follow the recurring charge. If 'Generate Zero $' is configured, revenue is controlled by invoice items. Cancellation usually results in a Credit Memo rather than an update to the discount line's dates.","category":"definitional","topic":"Fixed Amount Discounts"}
{"instruction":"Are split segments needed if renewals come from an external CPQ (like Salesforce) as amendments?","response":"Yes, split segments are needed. A new term is expected to appear as a separate SO line in Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"Split Segments"}
{"instruction":"How are negative unit price usage charges handled in OTR?","response":"Negative unit price usage charges should generally generate an Invoice (INV), but may generate a Credit Memo (CM-C) if the billing item amount is negative. This behavior varies based on the specific scenario.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What do AMENDMENT_TYPE values like QTY_I or TERM_D mean in the stage table?","response":"These values indicate the type of amendment trigger: `QTY_I`/`QTY_D` for Quantity Increase/Decrease, `TERM_I`/`TERM_D` for Term changes, and `PRC_I`/`PRC_D` for Price changes.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Model"}
{"instruction":"Will a renewal line pick up a new account code if it is changed in the Product Catalog?","response":"For existing RPCs, they will typically retain the old account code even for new segments. Only totally new RPCs or Orders will pick up the new code automatically. To update existing lines, a data backfill is required.","category":"procedural","topic":"Account Codes"}
{"instruction":"How are evergreen subscriptions grouped in Revenue?","response":"If the grouping rule is 'Subscription Name + Term Number', evergreen subscriptions (which retain the same term number) are grouped into a single contract. The revenue end date extends based on invoicing.","category":"definitional","topic":"Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"Why does a cancellation credit memo sometimes not offset revenue correctly?","response":"If settings like 'Invoice Past End-of-Term' are enabled and a product is billed, a CM-C might be automatically created for the term exceeding the subscription. This behavior is driven by complex interactions between billing rules and revenue recognition settings.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Cancellation"}
{"instruction":"How can I ensure consistent invoice amounts when using Delivery-Based Pricing with a specific delivery schedule (e.g., Monday-Saturday)?","response":"For Delivery-Based Pricing with specific delivery days, the charge's billing period should be set to 'Week' rather than 'Month'. Using 'Month' can result in inconsistent invoice amounts due to the varying number of days or weeks in a month, whereas 'Week' ensures alignment with the weekly delivery schedule.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Delivery-Based Pricing"}
{"instruction":"Is there a streamlined way to implement mid-term subscription-level price increases across a large customer base without using CSV uploads?","response":"Currently, the Batch Price Update widget is best suited for updating one rate plan charge at a time. For updating hundreds of different charges or subscriptions simultaneously, there is no streamlined UI tool available; the recommended approach is to prepare and upload CSV files using the Data Loader tool.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Batch Price Updates"}
{"instruction":"Who can run an analysis to determine if a tenant requires Performance & Bill Run Enhancement (PBE)?","response":"The Beehive team (specifically internal contacts like Sidi Zhu) can run an analysis to provide optimization options and identify if PBE is necessary for a specific tenant.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Performance Analysis"}
{"instruction":"Which customers can be referenced for HighRadius integration with Zuora?","response":"Zillow and Zoom are referenceable customers using HighRadius integration, specifically for dunning and lockbox payment use cases.","category":"comparison","topic":"HighRadius Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the common solutions for offline provisioning and entitlement management for IoT/Hardware devices?","response":"Common off-the-shelf vendors include Thales and Flexera. Many enterprise customers build homegrown systems. Platforms like Azure IoT Hub or Kaa often require connectivity and may not support offline provisioning scenarios as effectively.","category":"comparison","topic":"IoT Provisioning"}
{"instruction":"How do I set up a demo for Dynamic Usage Charges?","response":"As Dynamic Usage Charges are currently in an Early Adopter (EA) phase, you should work directly with the Product Manager to ensure the use case is supported and properly configured for a demo.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Dynamic Usage Charges"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for writing off bad debt in Zuora Billing?","response":"There is no single \"official\" standardized workflow for bad debt write-offs as practices vary by customer and downstream revenue implications. Common approaches include using Credit Memos or specific bad-debt Rate Plan Charges, but the exact method should be aligned with the customer's accounting requirements.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Bad Debt Write-off"}
{"instruction":"Can promo codes be applied directly via the Zuora UI or the initial order payload?","response":"No, promo codes cannot be applied via the standard UI or a single order payload. The process typically requires three steps: (1) Call the Promo Codes API to validate the code, (2) Call the Promo Codes API to consume/burn the code, and (3) Create the subscription or order with the specific discount rate plan charge appended.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Promo Codes"}
{"instruction":"What is the refresh interval for the Data Warehouse Connector (e.g., BigQuery)?","response":"The Data Warehouse Connector currently supports data refreshes on a regular interval, typically every 24 hours. On-demand refresh capabilities are not currently standard.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Warehouse Connector"}
{"instruction":"How is Insurance typically modeled in Zuora regarding term length and risk factors?","response":"Insurance calculations (premiums based on age, risk, term) are typically performed outside of Zuora in a specialized policy platform. The final calculated premium is then passed to Zuora as a flat fee or price. While Attribute-Based Pricing exists, complex actuarial math is usually kept external.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Insurance Modeling"}
{"instruction":"How can I simulate payment failures in a demo or test environment?","response":"Most test gateways provide specific credit card numbers or dollar amounts that trigger hard or soft declines. For the internal Zuora Test Gateway, specific \"magic words\" or values are documented to simulate various failure response codes.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Failure Simulation"}
{"instruction":"Can Heroku be used as an integration layer between Zuora and Salesforce instead of the managed connector?","response":"Yes, building an app on Heroku to act as middleware is a valid architectural pattern. It allows for custom handling of events and data sync to Salesforce custom objects, avoiding the API limits or specific constraints of the out-of-the-box Zuora 360 managed package.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integration Architecture"}
{"instruction":"How should I model a \"markup\" option plan that is a percentage of a basic plan?","response":"Zuora does not natively support a charge model that automatically calculates a percentage markup of another independent product's price. The recommended best practice is to calculate the markup amount in the upstream CRM or ordering system and pass it to Zuora as a flat fee.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Percentage Uplift Charges"}
{"instruction":"Can the 40-character limit for the City field in Contacts be increased?","response":"No, the character limit for standard contact fields like City is not configurable. Increasing it requires a platform product change.","category":"definitional","topic":"Contact Field Limits"}
{"instruction":"Does Attribute Based Pricing (ABP) automatically re-evaluate prices when a custom field changes during a subscription amendment?","response":"No, ABP typically evaluates pricing at the time of the Order creation. Simply changing a custom field on the subscription or account mid-cycle does not automatically trigger a re-rating of existing recurring charges unless a specific order action forces a re-evaluation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Attribute Based Pricing"}
{"instruction":"How can I open multiple OneID tenants simultaneously?","response":"Since OneID manages the session at the browser level, you must use different browser profiles (e.g., Chrome Profiles) or a feature like Firefox Multi-Account Containers to maintain separate active sessions for different tenants at the same time.","category":"Procedural","topic":"OneID Management"}
{"instruction":"How many levels of taxation does Z-Tax support?","response":"Z-Tax supports up to three levels of taxation (e.g., Federal, State, Local) per transaction line.","category":"definitional","topic":"Z-Tax"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora Tax calculate a tax on top of a total that already includes GST (Tax on Tax)?","response":"Generally, Zuora Tax calculates taxes based on the line subtotal. To support \"tax on tax\" or stacked taxes (e.g., a surcharge on top of GST), you typically configure the second tax as a separate tax code applied to the base amount, or use an external tax engine if complex compounding logic is required.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Tax Configuration"}
{"instruction":"What are the key changes to Zuora Billing API versioning introduced in late 2024?","response":"Zuora moved from numbered API versions (e.g., 186.0) to date-based versioning (e.g., 2024-05-20). Additionally, a new \"API Versioning\" setting in the admin console allows you to view and upgrade the tenant's default API version.","category":"definitional","topic":"API Versioning"}
{"instruction":"Is there a pre-built GL Connector for Microsoft Business Central?","response":"There is no specific named connector for Business Central. You would typically use the \"Configurable Summary GL Connector\" to generate a CSV file which can then be ingested by Business Central, or build a custom integration.","category":"architectural","topic":"GL Connectors"}
{"instruction":"Can Salesforce CPQ and Zuora CPQ coexist in the same Salesforce environment?","response":"Yes, they can coexist, typically by bifurcating the quoting flows (separate buttons). Data conflict on shared objects like `Product2` must be managed, noting that the modern Zuora 360+ sync allows for more granular control over object syncing to avoid conflicts.","category":"architectural","topic":"CPQ Co-existence"}
{"instruction":"How can I generate invoices in two different languages for the same customer?","response":"Zuora's standard multi-lingual support generates an invoice in the single language defined by the account's locale. To support two languages simultaneously (e.g., a bilingual invoice), you typically need to create a custom HTML template that hardcodes labels in both languages, rather than relying solely on the locale setting.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"Does a customer expanding to a new region (e.g., EU from Japan) need a new tenant?","response":"Often yes, especially if there are distinct requirements for data residency, currency, accounting rules, or ERP integrations. While Multi-Entity is the standard solution for managing multiple business units, separate tenants are required if data must physically reside in a different data center.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Org Architecture"}
{"instruction":"How can I enable proration for only specific charges in the catalog?","response":"You can enable \"Charge Level Proration\" under Billing Settings > Manage Features. This allows you to define proration rules at the individual charge level rather than globally.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Proration Settings"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora prorate charges by hour?","response":"No, the Zuora rating engine calculates proration based on days. Hourly proration requires custom calculations (e.g., passing the pre-calculated rated amount via API).","category":"definitional","topic":"Proration Granularity"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer A/B test Smart Retry vs CPR?","response":"Since payment methods aren't attached at invoice generation, random splitting is difficult. A common approach is to define cohorts using Customer Groups or custom fields on the Account, and then configure the retry logic to apply different strategies to those specific groups.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Smart Retry Testing"}
{"instruction":"What is the advantage of using a Developer Sandbox (DSBX) over an API Sandbox with Deployment Manager?","response":"A Developer Sandbox (DSBX) created via \"Refresh from Prod\" creates an exact replica of the production configuration and settings instantly. Deployment Manager requires manual setup and may not cover every single configuration setting, making DSBX a more reliable \"reset button\" for testing.","category":"comparison","topic":"Sandbox Strategy"}
{"instruction":"How does Overage Smoothing work with a Prepaid Drawdown charge model?","response":"Prepaid Drawdown takes precedence; the system consumes the prepaid balance first. Overage Smoothing logic applies only to the usage that exceeds the prepaid balance (the true overage).","category":"definitional","topic":"Usage Smoothing"}
{"instruction":"Can I build a Billing Preview report directly in Zuora Reporting/Analytics?","response":"Not out-of-the-box. Billing Preview data is accessible via API or Developer Tools. To report on it in Analytics, you typically need to use a Data Query or Workflow to fetch the preview data and store it in a custom object or export it for external reporting.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Billing Preview Reporting"}
{"instruction":"How can I handle an overpayment without issuing a refund?","response":"An overpayment sits as a credit balance (liability). To clear it without refunding, you must apply it to a debit. This can be done by generating the next invoice early and applying the credit, or by creating a Debit Memo (though this may have accounting implications).","category":"best_practice","topic":"Overpayment Handling"}
{"instruction":"Can I retrieve raw credit card (PAN) data from Zuora to migrate to another provider?","response":"No, Zuora does not expose raw PAN data via API due to PCI compliance standards. Exceptions for raw data extraction are extremely rare, require strict indemnification, and are handled via a specialized professional services engagement, not self-service.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Data Portability"}
{"instruction":"Can I modify a subscription while it is in 'Pending' status?","response":"Historically, modifying pending subscriptions has been limited. Enhancements are on the roadmap (targeted for late 2024/early 2025) to allow cancellation or modification of pending orders. Currently, it is best practice to manage the order in an external system (CRM) and only push to Zuora once finalized.","category":"definitional","topic":"Pending Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How does the new Salesforce 360+ Connector differ from the legacy version?","response":"The new Salesforce 360+ connector (Billing connector for Salesforce CPQ) offers improved performance and granular control over which objects are synced, allowing admins to reduce data volume usage in Salesforce.","category":"comparison","topic":"Salesforce Connector"}
{"instruction":"Is there a recorded demo for CPQ X?","response":"Yes, recorded demos and Saleo capture assets for CPQ X are available on Highspot for internal use.","category":"general","topic":"CPQ X Demo"}
{"instruction":"How do I manage a Staging environment connected to an external system when refreshing the sandbox breaks ID mappings?","response":"Refreshing a Zuora sandbox changes the internal IDs, breaking mappings with external static staging environments. Best practice is to either treat the sandbox as a long-lived tenant (avoiding refresh) or build automation to re-seed/re-map the sandbox data from the external system immediately after a refresh.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Environment Management"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between MRR Forecast in Billing and Revenue Booking-based RevRec?","response":"The MRR Forecast in Billing is a non-GAAP projection of recurring revenue. Zuora Revenue's Booking-based RevRec provides a compliant ASC606/IFRS15 view that includes allocations, standalone selling price (SSP), and one-time fees, which the billing forecast does not cover.","category":"comparison","topic":"Revenue Forecasting"}
{"instruction":"How can I check a customer's feature usage (e.g., custom objects) without logging into their tenant?","response":"You can use the internal 'Cerebro' tool to look up the account and view the 'Entitlements' or 'Trends' tab, which displays usage metrics.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Internal Tooling"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora support a B2B2C 'Bill on Behalf Of' model?","response":"Yes, Zuora can support this using Customer Hierarchy features (separating Invoice Owner and Subscription Owner). It requires detailed discovery to map out liability, invoice delivery, and payment responsibility.","category":"architectural","topic":"B2B2C Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can I mass activate currencies for a new product?","response":"There is no UI button to mass activate currencies. You can use a Workflow to query the ProductRatePlan IDs and iteratively call the API to enable the desired currencies for each plan.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Currency Management"}
{"instruction":"What causes the 'Fail to find a matching Charge Definition' error in Attribute Based Pricing?","response":"This error typically occurs if the underlying Product Charge Definition has a NULL end date. Updating the charge definition with a valid far-future end date via API often resolves the issue.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Attribute Based Pricing"}
{"instruction":"Why should a customer use Zuora for Accounts Receivable instead of their ERP (e.g., NetSuite)?","response":"Using Zuora for AR allows for a 'Subledger' approach where Billing and Revenue data remain the source of truth, simplifying the ERP integration to just summary Journal Entries. It avoids the complexity of reconciling two systems and prevents the rigidity of ERP logic from hindering pricing and packaging agility.","category":"comparison","topic":"Zuora vs ERP for AR"}
{"instruction":"What is the feedback on the JP Morgan (Chase) Payment Gateway?","response":"Feedback is generally mixed to negative due to the difficulty of working with their support structure and legacy infrastructure. Modern gateways like Stripe or Adyen are often recommended alternatives for a smoother integration experience.","category":"comparison","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"Can I use AQuA in a Dev tenant to save costs while using Snowflake Secure Data Share in Prod?","response":"While possible, it is not recommended because AQuA and Snowflake Secure Data Share use different data models and formats. Queries built for AQuA in Dev will not be portable to Prod, negating the testing value.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Snowflake Integration"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora integrate with Microsoft Power Platform?","response":"Integration is possible (e.g., AIMS360 uses it), but there have been historical compatibility issues regarding Microsoft's handling of OpenAPI 3.0 recursive calls.","category":"architectural","topic":"Microsoft Power Platform"}
{"instruction":"Why does cancelling a One-Time Charge (OTC) not generate a credit?","response":"To credit back a One-Time Charge, the cancellation effective date must match the charge's original start date. If the dates do not match, the system assumes the charge was valid for that period and may not issue a credit.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"One-Time Charges"}
{"instruction":"How can I apply a minimum charge based on the aggregate of multiple usage records?","response":"Standard Minimum Commit works per billing period. To enforce a minimum per transaction or hour across aggregated usage, you would likely need to use the Mediation (Rating Processor) engine with custom aggregation logic before the data reaches the rating engine.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Rating"}
{"instruction":"How do I manage a ramp deal with changing prices over time?","response":"Ramp deals can be managed using the Ramp Deal feature in Orders or by creating multi-period Rate Plan Charges with effective dates that align with the price changes. Misalignment of amendment dates with charge segments can cause billing errors.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Ramp Deals"}
{"instruction":"Is there a pre-built connector for PeopleSoft Finance?","response":"No, there is no pre-built connector. Integration is typically achieved via a generic summary Journal Entry export (GL Connector) or a custom middleware integration.","category":"architectural","topic":"ERP Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can a customer rotate their Cybersource v1 gateway key?","response":"No, Cybersource has deprecated key generation for v1. Customers needing to rotate keys must migrate to the Cybersource v2 gateway integration.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Gateway Migration"}
{"instruction":"What are common use cases for the \"Minimum Commitment\" or \"Percentage of Spend\" revenue models?","response":"Common use cases include manufacturing scenarios or B2B contracts where maintenance and support costs are calculated as a percentage of total spend (e.g., a 10% support fee added to usage). Another prominent use case involves threshold notifications at the account level, where actions are triggered when a customer's aggregated usage across multiple subscriptions reaches a certain daily or monthly limit.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Revenue Models"}
{"instruction":"How can customers perform bulk amendments if they do not have the Developer Tools (Mass Order Entry) feature?","response":"If Developer Tools are not available, customers can use the standard Data Loader. While the specific \"Amendment\" data dictionary template might be missing from some documentation, the object is supported. Alternatively, customers can use the \"Orders - Charge Overrides\" template in Data Loader to perform add-product or update-product actions in bulk, though this template may require enablement via a support request.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Loader"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between the \"% Charge Model\" and the \"Commitment Spend Model\"?","response":"The \"% Charge Model\" (or % of Spend) is a pricing model where the charge amount is calculated as a percentage of another billed amount, typically tied to usage or overall spend (e.g., a 10% support fee on a $100k bill). The \"Commitment Spend Model\" is a contractual agreement where a customer commits to spending a minimum amount over a period (e.g., $2M/year). Actual charges are tracked against this commitment, and a true-up is invoiced if the minimum is not met.","category":"definitional","topic":"Revenue Models"}
{"instruction":"Is the Zuora Secure Data Share for Snowflake bi-directional?","response":"No, the Zuora Secure Data Share for Snowflake is a one-way sync from Zuora to the customer's Snowflake account. It does not support pushing data from Snowflake back into Zuora.","category":"definitional","topic":"Snowflake Connector"}
{"instruction":"What are the benefits of vaulting payment methods in Zuora compared to an external gateway?","response":"The primary benefit of vaulting payment methods within Zuora is gateway flexibility. It allows you to route payments to different gateways based on business rules without requiring the customer to re-enter payment details. However, teams should consider localization requirements when deciding on a vaulting strategy.","category":"comparison","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling B2C invoices in Canada that need to be in both English and French?","response":"The recommended approach is to capture the customer's language preference upfront and then assign a localized Communication Profile and Invoice Template based on that preference. This avoids the need to create complex, cluttered templates that attempt to display both languages simultaneously.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"How should contract PDFs be managed when integrating Zuora with a Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) system?","response":"The recommended best practice is for the upstream system (e.g., a webapp or CPQ) to store the generated contract PDF directly into the CLM system and simply create the subscription in Zuora. It is generally not efficient to attach the PDF to the Zuora subscription object solely for the purpose of archiving it to a CLM later.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integration"}
{"instruction":"Which data objects are available via Zuora Secure Data Share for Snowflake?","response":"The Secure Data Share typically includes Billing objects. Objects such as Revenue Schedule, Revenue Event, and Chart of Accounts are technically part of the Finance/Revenue domain within Zuora Billing and are available for sync, though some specific objects may require explicit opt-in configuration.","category":"definitional","topic":"Snowflake Connector"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer offer an annual commitment with monthly payments?","response":"This can be achieved using Payment Schedules. The subscription is configured with an annual term and annual charges (ensuring the commitment is recognized), while a Payment Schedule is set up to break the collection of that total amount into monthly installments.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing"}
{"instruction":"How should external payments (e.g., processed in SAP) store identifying information in Zuora?","response":"The best practice is to use a custom field on the Payment object to store the external transaction ID or reference number. While the `second_reference_id` field is an option, a dedicated custom field is often cleaner. Note that the standard `number` field on the Payment object typically cannot be overridden via API.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"Can Power BI connect directly to Zuora without a Data Warehouse?","response":"Power BI is a visualization tool that typically requires a database or data warehouse source. While it cannot connect \"directly\" to Zuora's transactional engine in the same way it connects to a SQL DB, customers can use a Zuora Data Warehouse Connector (e.g., for Snowflake or SQL Server) to stage the data, or export Zuora data (via Data Query) into a local database that Power BI can query.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Analytics"}
{"instruction":"Why does the Salesforce CPQ Connector force a cancel/rebook (debook/rebook) for amendments?","response":"Salesforce CPQ's architecture typically handles changes by adding new quote lines, whereas Zuora modifies existing subscriptions via versioning. To align these disparate models and ensure accurate proration and downstream ERP revenue recognition, the connector often utilizes a cancel/rebook methodology rather than a native amendment update.","category":"comparison","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer upgrade their Zuora 360 or Zuora Quotes managed packages in Salesforce?","response":"Customers can obtain the latest installation links by opening a support ticket or checking the relevant CPQ community channels. The upgrade involves appending the installation URL to their Salesforce environment domain. It is strongly recommended to test the upgrade in a sandbox environment first to ensure compatibility with existing customizations.","category":"procedural","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can performance issues with large quotes (e.g., >50 lines) be addressed in Zuora CPQ?","response":"Performance for large quotes can be improved by enabling the Asynchronous Order Call setting in Quote Studio. This offloads the processing load and prevents timeouts in the UI during the submission process.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"CPQ"}
{"instruction":"How can unbilled usage data be exposed to a customer portal?","response":"Unbilled usage can be retrieved by querying the `RatingResult` table via API or Data Source Export. You can filter by the `status` field (looking for \"rated\" but not yet \"billed\" items) to display current consumption to customers before an invoice is generated.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage"}
{"instruction":"How can discounts be applied sequentially (e.g., 20% off, then 10% off the remainder) rather than stacked?","response":"This logic can be handled using Discount Classes. By assigning discounts to different classes and defining the application order, you can ensure that subsequent discounts are applied to the net amount remaining after previous discounts, rather than summing the discount percentages.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Pricing"}
{"instruction":"Can the Data Warehouse Connector synchronization be forced manually?","response":"No, synchronization is automated based on the configured latency. Standard connectors typically sync every 12 or 24 hours. The Snowflake connector offers higher frequency options (up to every 5 minutes) for an additional cost, but manual triggering is not a standard feature.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Warehouse"}
{"instruction":"Why does a connector stop working if the user who configured it changes roles?","response":"Connectors often run using the authentication credentials of the user who initially authenticated them. If that user's permissions are downgraded or their account is deactivated, the connector will fail. Best practice is to create a dedicated Integration/System User with the necessary permissions and use those credentials to authenticate connectors.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Connectors"}
{"instruction":"What should be checked if Bill Runs are taking longer than reported in Grafana?","response":"If Bill Runs appear to be taking longer than the execution times shown in Grafana dashboards, check the Tax Connector Health or tax calculation process. Latency or timeouts from an external tax engine (e.g., Vertex, Sovos) can extend the total processing time significantly without always appearing as \"Bill Run\" processing time.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Performance"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between Multi-Org and Multi-Entity in Zuora?","response":"Multi-Org provides virtual data barriers within a single tenant instance, allowing for shared configurations like products and accounting periods. Multi-Entity establishes physical data barriers, effectively creating unique environments (tenants) that do not share configurations by default, though they can be linked in a hierarchy.","category":"comparison","topic":"Architecture"}
{"instruction":"Can a single Payment Schedule be associated with multiple invoices?","response":"Yes, it is possible to associate a single Payment Schedule with multiple invoices, but this functionality is currently supported only via the API and is not available in the UI.","category":"definitional","topic":"Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can e-signature be handled when using the HubSpot Connector?","response":"A common approach is to build a workflow in HubSpot that updates a specific field (like \"Customer Acceptance Date\") on the Deal object once the signature is collected.

{"instruction":"What is the recommended provisioning flow for services based on Zuora subscriptions?","response":"The recommended flow is: 1) Submit the subscription to Zuora. 2) Use a callout or workflow to notify the provisioning system. 3) Once the external system confirms provisioning is complete, trigger an update to activate the subscription in Zuora.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Provisioning"}
{"instruction":"How can customers check their current status of a Prepaid Drawdown balance?","response":"Customers can query the prepaid balance status using the `queryPrepaidBalanceFundByKey` API to see the current fund level, and `queryPrepaidBalanceTransactions` to view the history of usage against that fund.","category":"definitional","topic":"APIs"}
{"instruction":"Should the same Salesforce API user be used for both Zuora 360 Sync and Custom Workflows?","response":"No, it is best practice to use distinct API users for different integrations. This ensures clear audit trails and allows permissions to be scoped specifically to the needs of each integration (e.g., 360 Sync may require different access than a custom workflow).","category":"best_practice","topic":"Security"}
{"instruction":"Can a Central Sandbox (CSBX) refresh be configured to include only specific data?","response":"No, Central Sandbox refreshes are typically full copies of the Production environment's data and configuration. There is no native option to select a partial data set for the refresh.","category":"definitional","topic":"Environment Management"}
{"instruction":"What are good use cases for Zuora Custom Logic?","response":"Custom Logic is excellent for implementing data validation rules to prevent downstream errors. Examples include validating email formats, restricting special characters in text fields, or enforcing field character limits to ensure compatibility with ERPs like NetSuite.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Logic"}
{"instruction":"Is the Snowflake Secure Data Share connector included in Sandbox environments if licensed for Production?","response":"No, the Snowflake Secure Data Share connector is licensed per environment. Having it in Production does not automatically grant access in Sandbox; a separate license or provisioning is required due to the costs associated with the secure share.","category":"definitional","topic":"Snowflake Connector"}
{"instruction":"Why might Invoice FX (Foreign Exchange) data be missing from data source exports?","response":"If Invoice FX data is missing, check if the \"Reporting Currencies\" feature (T9 setting) is enabled for the tenant. This feature is often required to expose the relevant FX transaction tables for reporting.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"What is the data retention period for Grafana data (specifically API metrics), and why might queries return no results?","response":"The data retention period for Grafana (which runs off the Pinot database) is approximately 90 to 100 days. Users attempting to query metrics or API volume beyond this 100-day window will likely see no results returned.","category":"definitional","topic":"Grafana Data Retention"}
{"instruction":"Is there an upper limit to the number of records allowed in a Dynamic Pricing Decision Table?","response":"While there is no strict upper limit enforced by the system, successful testing has been conducted up to 1,000 rows with 10 attributes. Exceeding this number (specifically beyond 10,000 cells) may result in errors from ZRules. For tables of that size, it is recommended to reevaluate the complexity of the pricing model to simplify it.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Dynamic Pricing"}
{"instruction":"Does purchasing the Multi-Org (MO) entitlement for Billing automatically include or require Multi-Org for Revenue?","response":"No, Multi-Org (MO) for Billing does not necessitate MO for Revenue. They are technically and commercially different entitlements with distinct goals. A customer can have MO for Billing enabled without enabling it for Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"Which payment gateways currently support Giro or AvtaleGiro payment methods for Norway?","response":"Currently, these methods are not natively supported by most major gateways in Zuora.

{"instruction":"What are the performance benchmarks for Performance Booster Elite (PBE) regarding high-volume invoice generation?","response":"Benchmarks indicate PBE can process approximately 2 million invoices in 5 hours for simple subscriptions (1 subscription with 1 rate plan). Complex subscriptions will lower performance. For extremely high volumes (e.g., 20 million invoices), it is recommended to distribute the load (e.g., via anniversary billing) or spread the bill run over 2-3 days rather than attempting a single-day run.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Performance Booster Elite"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit to the number of payment gateway instances (e.g., multiple merchant IDs) that can be configured in a single Zuora tenant?","response":"Zuora typically gates the number of unique gateway types (e.g., Adyen vs. Stripe) based on the contract, not the number of specific instances. It is technically possible to configure a large number (up to thousands) of instances of the same gateway type (e.g., 150+ Adyen merchant IDs) within a single tenant.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"How do I install and configure the Zuora MCP server for use with LLM tools like Claude Desktop or Cursor?","response":"To install the Zuora MCP server: 1) Install the 'zuora-mcp' package using npm. 2) Configure your tool (e.g., edit the configuration file for Claude) to include the 'mcpServers' definition with your BASE_URL, ZUORA_CLIENT_ID, and ZUORA_CLIENT_SECRET. 3) Restart the application (ensuring the process is fully stopped via Activity Monitor if needed). The server works with tools supporting MCP integration but may require specific personal licenses for tools like ChatGPT.","category":"procedural","topic":"Developer Tools"}
{"instruction":"How can I obtain a definition of the Zuora tables and fields pushed to Snowflake to perform a fit-gap analysis?","response":"A recommended approach is to use a demo or OTR instance to display the data in Snowflake and simultaneously perform an export on the corresponding object in Zuora. Comparing these outputs allows for verification of field definitions and types.","category":"procedural","topic":"Snowflake Integration"}
{"instruction":"Why would the 'Credit Memo' data source be unavailable in Reporting for a user with full permissions?","response":"The 'Credit Memo' data source is only available if the tenant has Invoice Settlement (IS) enabled. If the customer is not on Invoice Settlement, there are no credit memos to report on, and the data source will not appear in the reporting interface.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"What does 'maintenance mode' mean for the Subscribe and Amend (S&A) APIs, and what is the recommended path forward?","response":"'Maintenance mode' means the feature is not End of Life (EOL) yet, but only critical, revenue-impacting defects with no workarounds will be fixed. New features will not be added to these APIs. The recommended path is to transition to Orders Harmonization to access newer features and modern APIs.","category":"definitional","topic":"API Lifecycle"}
{"instruction":"Can the 'Single Version Subscription' feature be enabled on a tenant that already has existing versioned subscriptions?","response":"No, currently the Single Version Subscription feature cannot be enabled for tenants with existing versioned subscriptions. It requires a clean environment. Support for existing tenants is targeted for a future release (estimated Q2-Q3 2026). To test this feature, you must request enablement in a clean sandbox via a support ticket.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"Are Payment Links, Payment Forms, and Payment Pages mutually exclusive, and are they all PCI compliant?","response":"No, they are not mutually exclusive; a customer can implement all three simultaneously for different use cases (e.g., Links for ad-hoc payments, Forms/Pages for sign-up flows). All three options are PCI compliant and secure.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payments"}

{"instruction":"Does sending mediation data to external targets (Amazon S3, Snowflake, Kafka) incur additional costs?","response":"Yes, using targets that take data out of Zuora's systems (like Customer's Kafka or Snowflake) will add to data transfer costs. While the base charge is typically based on the number of events ingested, data egress to external targets incurs additional fees and may require Engineering setup.","category":"definitional","topic":"Mediation"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for billing Professional Services (T&M vs. Milestone) in Zuora?","response":"For Time & Materials (T&M), the recommended approach is to use the Usage model (consumption billing) to track hours burned. For Milestone-based billing, using Order Line Items (OLI) or Invoice Schedules is often preferred. Note that Usage models may require custom fields or Prepaid Drawdown to capture upfront booking metrics properly in Revenue.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Professional Services Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can I verify if a customer is actively using Hosted Payment Method (HPM) pages?","response":"You can verify HPM usage by checking telemetry data (e.g., Grafana) for calls to the 'POST /v1/rsa-signatures' API. Successful execution of this API indicates the customer is generating the signatures required for HPM or Payment Form implementation.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"How should gateway options be configured for Ecommerce transactions versus Recurring transactions?","response":"The gateway should typically be set to 'Recurring' by default. For Ecommerce transactions, you must override the gateway options on the Order API to flag the transaction type explicitly (e.g., as 'Ecommerce') to ensure high authorization rates and correct processing.","category":"procedural","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"What is a recommended technical approach for implementing custom dunning logic (suspend/resume/cancel) in Zuora?","response":"A common best practice is to utilize the Workflow engine to run a batch job that retrieves all open, unprocessed invoices. The workflow sorts these invoices into aging buckets and triggers the appropriate actions (suspend, cancel, etc.) based on the age. A parallel workflow should handle 'cleanup' by identifying invoices that have been paid and resuming the account.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Dunning"}
{"instruction":"What changes were made to the permissions for the Events & Notifications API in the Q3 2025 release?","response":"For compliance and security, API calls for Events & Notifications (which were previously available to multiple roles) are now restricted by default to users with the Platform Admin role. Users without this role will encounter errors when attempting to modify these settings via API.","category":"definitional","topic":"Security"}
{"instruction":"How should orders containing both physical hardware and software subscriptions be handled?","response":"The recommended approach is to bifurcate the order upstream (e.g., at the POS or Order Management system). The hardware portion should be routed to the fulfillment system, while only the software subscription/warranty portion is sent to Zuora. Zuora does not typically handle the physical fulfillment logic for hardware.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Order Management"}
{"instruction":"How can I migrate a subscription in the middle of a billing period without generating a new invoice for the already-paid period?","response":"Use the 'Catch-up Bill Run' feature. Load the subscription with its original start date (or start of the last term). Then, execute a catch-up bill run targeting the *next* planned billing date. This sets the 'Billed Through Date' forward to that date without generating a Zuora invoice or requiring a credit memo for the historical period.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for upgrading from the legacy Zuora 360 Sync to the new Zuora Connector for Salesforce?","response":"The migration process involves: 1) Requesting Support to enable the 'Object Enablement' page. 2) Navigating to Settings > Commerce > Sync Object Enablement and selecting the specific objects to sync (optimizing for only necessary objects to manage API load). 3) Submitting a support ticket to finalize the cutover. Be aware that the new sync is optimized for latency but may consume more SFDC API calls.","category":"procedural","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can a single customer account in Zuora support multiple currencies?","response":"Yes, using the 'Multiple Currencies' feature, a single account can hold subscriptions in different currencies. However, the account-level default currency cannot be changed once set. Enabling this requires careful consideration of downstream impacts on billing, payments, and reporting.","category":"definitional","topic":"Multi-Currency"}
{"instruction":"Are Payment Schedules compatible with the 'Multiple Currencies' feature?","response":"No, Payment Schedules are listed as a limitation when the 'Multiple Currencies' feature (allowing different currencies on a single account) is enabled. However, Payment Schedules are compatible with standard multi-currency usage where different accounts use different single currencies.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora offer a supported connector or managed package for Microsoft Dynamics 365?","response":"No, Zuora previously offered a connector but it has been rolled back and is no longer available. There is no official managed package for Microsoft Dynamics 365. Integration must be built via APIs or using a generic middleware solution.","category":"definitional","topic":"Integrations"}
{"instruction":"Can Amendments be processed using the Zuora Data Loader?","response":"Yes, Amendments are supported in Data Loader, though the specific Data Dictionary for them may not be visible by default and might need to be requested. Alternatively, users can use the Orders template within Data Loader to perform actions like adding products or charge overrides, which is often the recommended modern approach.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Loader"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended strategy for migrating Zuora CPQ configurations and metadata when splitting a Salesforce instance (e.g., divestiture)?","response":"There is no native 'clone and purge' functionality to move Zuora CPQ data between Salesforce production organizations. The recommended approach is to treat it like a new implementation or use Salesforce deployment tools (like Copado) to migrate configurations and metadata. Detailed data tagging is critical for migrating accounts and contacts correctly.","category":"best_practice","topic":"CPQ Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can issue-based revenue recognition be handled for Media customers (e.g., weekly issues, extra issues)?","response":"For issue-based revenue recognition, such as with weekly media publications, it is recommended to either upload a schedule of 'delivery dates' or utilize a consumption-based model. In this model, the delivery of the issue serves as the trigger for revenue recognition.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Issue-Based Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for handling large volume data extractions for BI3 Views if the API is too slow?","response":"For large volume extractions where the standard API is insufficient (e.g., exceeding 20 million lines or experiencing timeouts), it is recommended to use the BI3 extract COE program or leverage Zuora Secure Data Share (Snowflake) for more efficient data retrieval.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Data Extraction"}
{"instruction":"What are the benchmarks and recommendations for switching from SFTP to API for data ingestion?","response":"API provisioning is generally recommended over SFTP for modern integrations. The current benchmark for APIs is approximately 1 million transactions/lines per push. APIs support ingesting transactions with file iterations in parallel. For extremely high volumes, checking outbound limitations is also advised.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Integration Methods"}
{"instruction":"How can the Long Term/Short Term (LTST) reclassification journal be disabled?","response":"To stop the LTST reclassification, the specific job should be unscheduled or not run. However, users must ensure that the final reversal journal occurs if the process was previously in use. If the requirement is related to netting, that specific configuration may need to be disabled.","category":"Procedural","topic":"LTST Journal"}
{"instruction":"Does the K2 integration between Zuora Billing and Revenue support evergreen subscriptions?","response":"Yes, the K2 integration supports evergreen subscriptions, but with specific ground rules. Typically, this requires that no revenue allocation is performed and revenue recognition is based on billing (e.g., 'Upon Billing') to avoid complexities with Contractual Contract Value (CCV) calculations.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How is the Unit Sell Price calculated in Zuora Revenue?","response":"The Unit Sell Price is calculated using the formula: Extended Sell Price divided by Quantity divided by Term (Ext Sell Price / Qty / Term).","category":"Definitional","topic":"Formulas"}
{"instruction":"How can the 'Refresh Sandbox' menu be enabled in the Zuora Revenue UI?","response":"The 'Refresh Sandbox' menu is controlled by a specific profile option named 'Refresh Sandbox'. This profile must be enabled for the option to appear in the user interface.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox Management"}
{"instruction":"How does the Zuora Revenue to Workday connector handle journal balancing?","response":"Zuora Revenue ensures that journal entries are balanced (Total Debits equal Total Credits) before sending them. The Workday connector will not post unbalanced journals. The journals contain both Ledger Accounts and Revenue Categories (Worktags).","category":"Definitional","topic":"Workday Connector"}
{"instruction":"Why might a line be missing from the Waterfall Report even if it belongs to the selected period?","response":"A line may be excluded from the Waterfall Report if it has been fully amortized/recognized in a prior period and the system's profile setting for retaining fully amortized lines has caused it to drop off. Duplicate lines in the report can occur if multiple Revenue or Deferred segments exist for a single line.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Reporting Discrepancies"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora Revenue reports be triggered automatically by system events (e.g., data arrival)?","response":"No, there is currently no functionality to trigger reports based on system events or data arrival hooks. Reports must be run either ad-hoc or on a time-based schedule.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Report Scheduling"}
{"instruction":"How should Termination for Convenience (TFC) clauses be handled regarding revenue allocation?","response":"For contracts with TFC clauses (e.g., a 12-month contract cancellable after 3 months), best practice is often to limit the revenue allocation to the guaranteed term (e.g., the first 3 months). This can be managed by booking the initial guaranteed term and treating subsequent periods as renewals, though specific handling depends on auditor requirements.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Revenue Allocation"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit on the number of transaction lines in a Revenue Contract (RC)?","response":"There is no hard system limit on the number of lines in an RC, but performance issues (such as slow loading times when opening the RC in the Workbench) typically arise when an RC exceeds 500 to 1,000 lines.","category":"Definitional","topic":"System Limits"}
{"instruction":"Can a single Zuora Billing entity be mapped to multiple Zuora Revenue organizations?","response":"No, mapping a single Billing entity to multiple Revenue organizations is a custom requirement and not supported out-of-the-box. Doing so can create significant data gaps, such as issues with functional currency alignment.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Multi-Org Configuration"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'Before Validate' and 'Before Bundle Explode' stages in Data Augmentation?","response":"'Before Validate' runs data augmentation logic before the system performs validation on the source data. 'Before Bundle Explode' runs after validation is complete but before the bundle explosion process occurs; this stage is useful for copying attributes from a parent bundle line to its children to avoid duplication of effort.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Data Augmentation"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora Revenue support booking in one currency and invoicing in another for the same transaction?","response":"No, Zuora Revenue requires that the booking (sales order) and the billing (invoice) for a transaction be in the same transactional currency to ensure proper reconciliation and accounting.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Currency Support"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora Revenue support multiple reporting currencies within a single organization?","response":"No, Zuora Revenue does not support multiple reporting currencies within a single organization. It typically supports one functional currency and one reporting currency per organization.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Currency Support"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling subscription cancellations in Billing to ensure correct flow to Revenue?","response":"The best practice is to perform a Bill Run after the cancellation to generate the necessary credit memos or invoice reversals within Billing. This ensures the cancellation flows to Revenue as a transaction (e.g., CM-C) rather than relying on manual write-offs, which may not trigger the correct revenue reversal logic (CM-RO).","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Cancellations"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between Order to Revenue (OTR) and the K2 integration?","response":"K2 is the legacy integration framework between Zuora Billing and Revenue, which is no longer receiving new feature enhancements. Order to Revenue (OTR) is the current standard integration that supports newer features (like Attribute Based Pricing and Multi-Currency) and addresses gaps present in K2.","category":"Comparison","topic":"Integration Types"}
{"instruction":"Are General Ledger (GL) codes mandatory input fields for data loaded into Zuora Revenue?","response":"Yes, GL codes are typically mandatory inputs. They are usually captured upstream (e.g., in the Product Master or Order Lines) and passed in the input file to ensure that Zuora Revenue can generate the correct Journal Entry activity for the subledger.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Data Ingestion"}
{"instruction":"Does setting a revenue line amount to $0 reverse previously recognized revenue?","response":"Yes, if a line's amount is updated to $0 (e.g., via a cancellation or modification), the system will reverse the previously recognized contract revenue, even if the Performance Obligation (POB) template is set to 'Retain Amount'.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Revenue Reversal"}
{"instruction":"How should initial open balances be loaded via MJE during a migration?","response":"Initial open balances can be loaded via a Manual Journal Entry (MJE). The MJE should book the balance (typically to Deferred Revenue and a contra-Revenue account). If the balance already exists in the GL, users can select the option to 'Skip GL Transfer' for that specific MJE batch to avoid double-posting.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Is it advisable to use negative Selling Price (SSP) values in Zuora Revenue?","response":"No, using negative SSP values is not recommended as it can lead to irrational allocations where allocated values exceed the total contract value. $0 SSP is permitted, but negative values should be avoided.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"SSP Allocation"}

{"instruction":"Can Ramp Orders in Zuora Billing automatically trigger Ramp Revenue recognition in Revenue?","response":"Ramp Orders in Billing populate the Ramp ID and Deal Reference in the integration, but this does not automatically trigger ramp normalization in Revenue unless specifically configured. In Order to Revenue (OTR), the Ramp Deal Reference may not populate by default and might require Data Augmentation.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Ramp Revenue"}
{"instruction":"Does Attribute Based Pricing (ABP) work with the K2 integration?","response":"No, Attribute Based Pricing (ABP) is not supported out-of-the-box with the K2 integration because the K2 CCV service reads list prices from the static Product Catalog rather than the ABP data model. ABP is supported in the Order to Revenue (OTR) integration.","category":"Comparison","topic":"Feature Support"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'Period Name' filter work in the Waterfall Report?","response":"The 'Period Name' filter in the Waterfall Report selects data based on the Revenue Schedule. If revenue is scheduled to be recognized in the selected period, it will appear in the report, regardless of whether the Order Date or Start Date is in the past. 'Current Period' displays a snapshot of all future scheduled revenue as of that period close.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Reporting Logic"}
{"instruction":"Can a user undo an event file upload before processing?","response":"It is not possible to 'undo' or delete the file itself after upload. However, users can navigate to the Inbound > Unprocessed Events screen and delete the specific event records before they are processed by the system.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Data Management"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for the user account used to schedule background jobs?","response":"It is best practice to use a dedicated generic account (e.g., an IT or Admin group email) to schedule background jobs. This prevents jobs from failing or needing rescheduling if a specific employee leaves the organization and their user account is deactivated.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"System Administration"}
{"instruction":"Is there an automated process to delete data from the Revenue Line Staging table?","response":"No, there is no automated process to delete data from the Line Staging table. For small volumes, data can be deleted via the 'Manage Inbound' UI. For large volumes, an asynchronous process can be used if Unified Authentication (UA) is enabled, or a support ticket may be required.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Data Maintenance"}
{"instruction":"How are POB template version changes applied to existing Revenue Contracts?","response":"POB template versions are applied based on the Sales Order Date. Re-collecting an existing Sales Order line will not automatically apply a newer POB template version if the order date remains the same. The line generally retains the version active at the time of its initial collection.","category":"Definitional","topic":"POB Configuration"}
{"instruction":"Can Revenue Journals and MJEs be transferred in a single Accounting Batch?","response":"Yes, Zuora Revenue defaults to transferring GL Journals and MJEs in a single batch unless a filter is applied. For this to work effectively, the field mappings for both objects should be aligned.","category":"Definitional","topic":"GL Interface"}
{"instruction":"Is there a read-only mode for a Zuora Revenue tenant during maintenance or cutover?","response":"There is no single global switch to put a tenant into read-only mode. The recommended workaround is to bulk update user roles to remove write privileges (make them Read Only) during the maintenance window and revert the changes afterwards.","category":"Procedural","topic":"System Administration"}
{"instruction":"What is the row limit for BI View exports and the recommended alternative for larger datasets?","response":"Exports from BI Views are limited to approximately 20 million rows.

{"instruction":"What is the expected behavior when a subscription with 3 lines for 1 year has lines end-dated to the last day of month 1 in month 2, and new lines are added, with a prospective modification rule? Specifically regarding SSP behavior.","response":"In a scenario where a subscription has lines end-dated to the last day of the previous month (month 1) during month 2, and new lines are added with a prospective modification rule, the remaining SSP (Standalone Selling Price) should be calculated based on the Posted Percentage as of the end of the month. Even if the original lines are end-dated, the SSP for the remaining portion of the original line (that was presumably recognized) might be locked in or calculated based on the posted percentage, rather than being set to zero. This ensures the correct portion of the carve from the original allocation is retained.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"revenue_allocation"}
{"instruction":"Which mandatory subscription fields must be defaulted or included when supporting dual data sources (e.g., manual uploads, NetSuite, Oracle). Key fields typically include Subscription Name, Term, and RPC-related fields (Rate Plan Charge). It is also important to validate RPC Type fields; for example, if the upstream system sends null values, defaulting the RPC Type to 'One Time' (or the appropriate charge type) may be necessary to avoid errors like 'Amount Based Events is Not Supported only for Recurring charges'.","category":"best_practice","topic":"data_ingestion"}
{"instruction":"Why might a Custom Report layout not show data on the screen when 'Run Reports' is clicked, but generates successfully when using 'Submit Download'?","response":"If a Custom Report layout displays no data on-screen but works via 'Submit Download', it often indicates that the report was not built for UI display or that a specific data point is causing the on-screen rendering to fail (e.g., warping HTML elements). Checking the SQL logs with log level 2 can help identify where the failure occurs.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"reporting"}
{"instruction":"When unfreezing a Revenue Contract (RC) with 'Retain' as the option, why would the allocation eligible flag be set to 'N' and SSP group assignments disappear?","response":"If unfreezing an RC with 'Retain' results in the allocation eligible flag being set to 'N' and the loss of SSP group assignments, check the contract modification rules. This behavior has been observed when the unfreeze contract mod rule is set to 'Retro' (or 'Existing Alloc Treatment') on an RC that was in Retro mode. This may require raising a support ticket if no obvious customizations explain the behavior.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"contract_modification"}

{"instruction":"Why does an amount-based event upload fail with the error 'Amount Based Events is Not Supported only for Recurring charges' even when the transaction is not from Zuora Billing?","response":"This error can occur if the product validates against the source field value and the RPC Type is null or missing. Even for transactions from upstream systems (non-Zuora Billing), ensuring the RPC Type is explicitly populated (e.g., defaulted to 'One Time') can resolve this validation error. Additionally, verify that the event criteria (like SO Line Number/Charge Number + Version) matches an existing line; if the version is missing or criteria aren't met, the error message might be misleading.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"event_processing"}

{"instruction":"Why would the Extended SSP Value/SSP List Price of a recurring charge appear double the expected value when a fixed amount discount charge is associated with it in OTR?","response":"This issue can occur in OTR (Order to Revenue) when using Fixed Amount Discounts (FAD) on recurring charges, specifically if the FAD is set to 'Generate actual value in booking'. If the Parent Charge Number and Parent Charge Segment are populated correctly but the SSP sell/list prices are still incorrect (e.g., double), it may be a bug requiring a support ticket. A potential workaround to test is updating the RPC_MODEL of the fixed amount discount to 'Discount-Percentage', though this does not always resolve the issue.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"ssp_allocation"}
{"instruction":"How should a line with an incorrect order date (future dated due to a workflow issue) be corrected if the customer wants it collected in the current period?","response":"Data updates or corrections for upstream issues (like incorrect order dates) should be fixed in the upstream system (Billing), not directly in Revenue. Fixing only in Revenue causes reconciliation issues. The best practice is to debook/cancel the subscription upstream and create a new one with the correct details, or work with Billing support to update the data points, remove lines from the stage, and re-collect.","category":"best_practice","topic":"data_correction"}

{"instruction":"When using OTR, how are Revenue Schedules handled since user-defined schedules are not available?","response":"In OTR, user-defined schedules are generally replaced by standard POB (Performance Obligation) templates or manual upload of revenue/forecast schedules if needed. User-defined schedules are rarely used. For requirements like recognizing a specific % upfront and the rest ratably (e.g., a 2-year term with a termination clause), this is typically handled via POB configuration or manual overrides rather than the legacy user-defined schedule feature. through Level 1 allocation.","category":"definitional","topic":"revenue_allocation"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer resolve 'PARENT REFERENCE WAS NOT FOUND' or 'Credit memo amount is more than available invoice amount' errors for a Credit Memo in Zuora Revenue?","response":"These errors typically indicate data integrity issues where the Credit Memo cannot find its parent invoice or the amounts do not align (e.g., CM > Invoice). The resolution usually involves verifying the data upstream to ensure the parent invoice exists and has sufficient balance. If the error is valid (e.g., bad data entry), the transaction might need to be corrected or deleted from the stage if it hasn't been processed.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"data_validation"}
{"instruction":"In a multi-book environment, is it possible to direct specific data (e.g., based on a subsidiary) to only one book while sending all data to the primary book?","response":"Technically, if a Book ID is populated on the transaction, data will be pushed to that book alone; if blank, it goes to all books. However, since customers are typically charged for primary book volume, directing volume only to a secondary book might have commercial/contractual implications. For requirements like handling different subsidiaries in different books (e.g., one book for US, one for Israel), the standard approach is often to use one book and filter/segment the data downstream (e.g., when pushing to NetSuite) rather than splitting ingestion at the book level in Revenue.","category":"best_practice","topic":"multi_book"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'Pull' and 'Push' for data ingestion in K2 vs OTR?","response":"In K2, data is generally 'Pulled' (Zuora Revenue fetches data). In OTR, data is 'Pushed' (Billing pushes data to Revenue via events/actions). For other upstream systems, it is typically a 'Push' via API/SFTP.","category":"definitional","topic":"data_ingestion"}
{"instruction":"Can unbilled revenue be recognized through event uploads?","response":"Yes, unbilled revenue can be recognized through event uploads, provided the Sales Order (SO) has a value and the revenue release is based on an event (e.g., POB is event-based). For example, if SO is 20k, Invoice is 12k, and an event of 15k is uploaded, revenue to date will be 15k.","category":"procedural","topic":"revenue_recognition_rules"}
{"instruction":"Are there plans to build an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Zuora Revenue to enable AI agent interactions?","response":"There are no near-term plans to build an MCP server. The long-term vision involves first building the right AI models/LLMs and ensuring the necessary functional APIs and object models exist to support autonomous operations (like creating RC grouping templates or POBs via natural language).","category":"definitional","topic":"roadmap"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling negative invoice lines for adjustments (e.g., Professional Services credits) that fail to collect because the SO line is positive?","response":"For upstream adjustments to Professional Services or similar charges, the best practice is often to cancel and rebook (cancel the original and create a new correct line) rather than sending negative invoice lines against a positive SO line, which can cause collection failures or collection issues.","category":"best_practice","topic":"billing_adjustments"}
{"instruction":"What happens if a Credit Memo is modified upstream (e.g., booked on 5/27, changed on 5/28)? Does Revenue sync the update?","response":"Zuora Revenue typically does not accept updates to billing documents (Invoices/Credit Memos) once they are synced. The standard and recommended practice is to cancel the incorrect document and re-bill/re-issue a new one.","category":"best_practice","topic":"billing_adjustments"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora Revenue support data warehouse connectors other than Snowflake Secure Share?","response":"Currently, Zuora Revenue primarily supports Snowflake Secure Share for data warehousing. It does not have out-of-the-box connectors for other warehouses like Databricks or BigQuery in the same manner.","category":"definitional","topic":"integrations"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limitation on straight-lining ramps that decrease in value (step-down) over time?","response":"No, there is no specific limitation on straight-lining ramps that go down in value. As long as the ramp deal reference/identifiers are populated across the charges, the application should handle the straight-lining calculation.","category":"definitional","topic":"revenue_allocation"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer put conversion waterfalls on hold?","response":"Conversion waterfalls (transfer accounting) can be put on hold by loading/applying a hold using mass actions, or potentially by managing the collection/processing flags if caught early.","category":"procedural","topic":"holds"}
{"instruction":"Does the NetSuite connector support multi-book?","response":"Yes, the NetSuite GL connector supports multi-book environments (e.g., Pure Storage, 66 Degrees).","category":"definitional","topic":"integrations"}
{"instruction":"How should write-off recoveries (payments received after a write-off) be handled in Revenue?","response":"Payment application is generally not a Revenue function. If a write-off (Credit Memo) has already been processed in Revenue, and a payment is later received, the best practice is to handle the reversal/adjustment in Billing (e.g., via a Debit Memo) but *exclude* that Debit Memo from Revenue to avoid double counting or messing up the already recognized/written-off revenue. Alternatively, an MJE (Manual Journal Entry) or adjustment in Revenue can be used if the system is closed.","category":"best_practice","topic":"payment_processing"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to ingest externally generated files (like reports) back into the Secure Share environment?","response":"No, Secure Share is for outbound data sharing (Zuora to Customer). You cannot ingest external files or reports back into the Secure Share environment.","category":"definitional","topic":"secure_share"}
{"instruction":"How can specific transactions (like test accounts) be skipped or excluded from sending to Revenue?","response":"Transactions can be excluded by: 1. Updating the 'Processed' flag to 'X' (or similar ignore status) in the Revenue stage tables to stop them from processing. 2. Using the 'Exclude from Revenue' flag/fields in Zuora Billing (e.g., `excludeItemBillingFromRevenueAccounting`) before the data is sent.","category":"procedural","topic":"data_exclusion"}
{"instruction":"Why might a usage event in the consumption stage table have a Processed flag 'R' but not release revenue?","response":"A Processed flag of 'R' in the daily consumption stage table usually indicates the record was ready or related to a line, but if revenue isn't releasing, check: 1. If the line has been fully collected. 2. If the POB template is correctly assigned (e.g., 'ZR Usage Amount Event'). 3. If the usage date falls within the open period and valid contract dates. 4. If the setup is K2 vs OTR (Advanced Consumption is OTR-native; K2 behavior can be inconsistent).","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"consumption_revenue"}
{"instruction":"Does the 'Contains' filter operator in reporting support multiple values?","response":"No, the 'Contains' filter generally does not support multiple values. The 'In' operator should be used for multiple values.","category":"procedural","topic":"reporting"}
{"instruction":"How is foreign currency translation handled for booking-based revenue recognition?","response":"For booking-based revenue, if booking revenue exceeds the billed amount, it typically uses the exchange rate from the Sales Order (SO). When the actual billing occurs, the system reverses the SO-based revenue and re-recognizes it at the Invoice exchange rate (or adjusts the CL/Unbilled AR accordingly).","category":"definitional","topic":"multi_currency"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to track report usage (who runs what report and when)?","response":"Yes, internal queries on the `rpro_schd_prog_g` and related tables can track report usage (submit history). For example, a query joining `rpro_rep_schd_g`, `rpro_rep_g`, and `rpro_schd_prog_g` can list job IDs, report names, users, and run times. This data is not typically exposed in a standard UI report but can be queried via Data Query Utility.","category":"procedural","topic":"system_administration"}
{"instruction":"Does the 'Pending Activation' status enhancement apply to K2 customers?","response":"No, the 'Pending Activation' status enhancement is supported only for OTR (Order to Revenue), not K2.","category":"definitional","topic":"subscription_lifecycle"}
{"instruction":"Is there an additional cost for BI Views?","response":"No, BI Views are out-of-the-box (OOTB) and do not have an additional cost.","category":"definitional","topic":"licensing"}
{"instruction":"Can a bundle split be calculated based on duration (start/end dates) rather than a static percentage?","response":"Ideally, SSP/Grouping stratifications should be static. While bundle splits based on duration have been implemented (e.g., for BMC) by uploading split files for each term or using attributes, this approach faces challenges with amendments (renewals, proration). The system doesn't natively calculate dynamic duration-based splits OOTB without custom handling or specific attribute configurations.","category":"best_practice","topic":"bundling"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'ENABLE_ONE_TIME_CREDIT_BACK' profile required for OTR?","response":"This profile is generally considered obsolete or not prioritized for OTR, as OTR handles credit backs and one-time charges differently than K2.","category":"definitional","topic":"profiles_settings"}
{"instruction":"When refreshing a Billing Sandbox from Production, what snapshot time is used?","response":"The snapshot is taken at the same time the refresh is initiated.","category":"definitional","topic":"environment_management"}
{"instruction":"Is the Consumption Revenue module free for all customers?","response":"The Consumption module is now generally included (free) for new deals, but for existing customers, it typically requires an amendment or order form update to enable it. It should be scoped with the Client Manager/SDM before enabling.","category":"definitional","topic":"licensing"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR have an auto-collect profile?","response":"No, there is no 'auto-collect' profile in OTR. Data collection is triggered by scheduling the Data Collection job or by file uploads.","category":"definitional","topic":"data_collection"}
{"instruction":"Is Invoice Settlement Harmonization (ISH) supported on K2?","response":"No, ISH is not supported on K2; it is supported only on OTR.","category":"definitional","topic":"integrations"}
{"instruction":"Can Billed Revenue Start/End dates be displayed on the Waterfall tab of the Workbench?","response":"Currently, the Waterfall tab in the Workbench defaults to showing Revenue Contract (Order) dates. Displaying Billed Revenue specific start/end dates on the Waterfall tab is not standard functionality and would likely require an enhancement or viewing the Billed Revenue Waterfall report separately.","category":"definitional","topic":"ui_features"}
{"instruction":"Do standalone invoices flow automatically into Revenue in OTR?","response":"Yes, in OTR, standalone invoices flow into Revenue upon posting in Billing, provided they are not excluded.","category":"definitional","topic":"data_ingestion"}
{"instruction":"When is the 'Revision Period' date used for SSP derivation?","response":"Using the Revision Period date to derive SSP during a modification is rare. The best practice and most common approach is to use 'Line SO Book Date' or 'Line Level SSP Date' to ensure consistency and simplify reconciliation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"ssp_allocation"}
{"instruction":"Can we configure alerts for Job success/failure in Revenue?","response":"Yes, alerts can be configured for job statuses. You can select to receive notifications only for failed jobs in the configuration.","category":"procedural","topic":"system_administration"}

{"instruction":"What is required in RevPro if a customer changes their fiscal year end (e.g., June 30 to Sept 30)?","response":"If only the year-end is changing (but fiscal periods remain calendar months), the accounting calendar needs to be updated. A full summarization rerun is required to correct YTD (Year-To-Date) reporting buckets.","category":"procedural","topic":"accounting_calendar"}
{"instruction":"Can a closed period be reopened in a Sandbox environment for testing?","response":"There is no standard feature or script to simply 'reopen' a closed period in Sandbox. Adjustments should generally be made in the current open period. Re-opening periods is a complex data intervention that is not standard self-service.","category":"procedural","topic":"period_close"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit on the number of self-service refreshes for a Revenue Sandbox?","response":"Currently, there is no strict limit on the number of refreshes for a Revenue Sandbox from Production.","category":"definitional","topic":"environment_management"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'MULTI_CURR_FV_REPORT_LEVEL' profile affect allocation currency?","response":"When set to 'Reporting Currency', allocation is performed in the reporting currency. However, if set to 'Lowest Common Currency', and all lines match the functional currency, it allocates in functional. This profile determines the currency level at which FV (Fair Value) allocation logic is applied when transaction currencies differ.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi_currency"}
{"instruction":"Are there specific fields to exclude items from Revenue Accounting in the Order API?","response":"It appears to be enabled by default and non-editable for some customers in Production. If it needs to be disabled, a support ticket is likely required.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"profiles_settings"}
{"instruction":"Can the Waterfall Transfer job be decoupled from the Period Close process to run multiple times throughout the period for mid-period ARR reporting?","response":"Yes, the Transfer Accounting job (which preps the GL) can be run as many times as needed throughout the period. However, there are implications to consider: running it mid-period may capture contract modifications that trigger reversals and rebooking, and certain data points such as the GL date may change. It is not a blocker, but the user must understand these potential data shifts.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Transfer Accounting Job"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for mass updating customer names in Zuora Revenue, for example in the case of an acquisition?","response":"Mass actions on labels do not work for Customer Name because that field is used to determine workbench header information. The recommended options are: (1) Repush transactions from upstream (e.g., Workday) into Zuora Revenue, which may require contract updates or integration changes; or (2) A backend update. The Mass Action feature cannot currently be enabled for Customer Name.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Customer Name Update"}
{"instruction":"How can we change the GL outbound file extension from .ZIP to .CSV?","response":"To change the extension, you can disable the profile option `COMPRESS_XFER_REP_FILE_OUTPUT` or adjust the report layout configuration. If using SFTP to transfer files, you must also raise a TOPS ticket to configure the SFTP side to accept/expect the uncompressed file. If using APIs to transfer, disabling the profile option should suffice.","category":"procedural","topic":"GL Outbound File"}
{"instruction":"Under what conditions should a customer move to a dedicated shard, and does it guarantee better performance?","response":"Customers with high volume, requiring faster processing or quicker closes, benefit from a dedicated shard. Shared shards can degrade performance for such customers. Moving to a dedicated shard typically improves performance, provided the infrastructure (CPUs, threads, I/O, consumers) is sized correctly for the volume; if volume exceeds the provisioned infra, it may still need scaling.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Dedicated Shard"}
{"instruction":"What does the 'T Ttl Rev Prior Qtr CL' column in the Prior Period CA/CL report represent, and does it include MJEs?","response":"This column represents the Prior Quarter Contract Liability (CL) revenue in the transaction currency. It does include Manual Journal Entries (MJEs), but they are not shown separately.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prior Period CA/CL Report"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to change the CV Eligible flag to 'N' after the FV analysis has run to bypass SSP?","response":"No, Data Augmentation (DA) rules typically run at the pre-stage or line-stage. Changing the CV Eligible flag to 'Y' or 'N' after the Fair Value (FV) analysis stage will not trigger the system to re-derive or bypass SSP as expected, because the derivation happens earlier in the processing sequence.","category":"procedural","topic":"SSP Price / CV Flag"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'Resubmit' type work in report scheduling, and is there an option for detailed incremental Transfer Accounting reports?","response":"In report scheduling, 'From the Completion of Prior run' waits for the current run to finish before starting the next, while 'From the start of the prior run' does not wait. regarding Transfer Accounting (TA), the standard outbound report is a summary. There is no native option to schedule a detailed incremental TA report; the Accounting Report typically requires a full monthly run.","category":"procedural","topic":"Report Scheduling"}
{"instruction":"What is the impact on Zuora Revenue if a K2 customer moves to a Multi-Org structure in Billing?","response":"If Revenue is configured as non-multi-org and the customer does not intend to enable multi-org in Revenue, they must map the Billing Org to the default Revenue Org in the OTR settings. If they wish to enable multi-org in Revenue (supported for K2), it requires mapping and profile changes. A GS engagement is recommended if the customer cannot manage the profile changes and end-to-end testing themselves.","category":"procedural","topic":"Multi-Org Setup"}
{"instruction":"Does Manual Linking allow for prospective allocation, or does it default to retrospective?","response":"Manual Linking specifically allows for prospective allocation. However, if the Revenue Contract (RC) is already in a retrospective state (e.g., if it was delinked and then re-linked), it will remain retrospective.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Manual Link Allocation"}
{"instruction":"Why are objects like RCRF, Netting, and Accounting Summary missing from the standard Object Dictionary?","response":"These are views derived from other objects rather than direct tables, so they are not listed in the standard dictionary. Their definitions can be viewed in Secure Share (Snowflake).","category":"definitional","topic":"Object Dictionary"}
{"instruction":"Can a single Revenue Contract support a change in functional currency (e.g., from USD to INR) midway through its term?","response":"No, it is not possible to have multiple functional currencies in a single Revenue Contract. The recommended approach is to cancel the existing transactions and migrate them to a new entity/contract with the new currency. Data fixes to force this are not recommended due to auditability concerns.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Functional Currency Change"}
{"instruction":"Does the 'RPO' (Remaining Performance Obligation) report include contracts that are on hold?","response":"RPO is calculated based on revenue schedules. If the hold prevents schedules from generating or being considered valid, they may not appear, but generally, hold indicators exist. The consensus is that RPO relies on the existence of revenue schedules.","category":"definitional","topic":"RPO Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Does the system consider unreleased deferred balances in the Long Term/Short Term (LT/ST) calculation?","response":"No, the system does not include forecast data in the LT/ST calculation. It only considers the billed released portion (Short Term Deferred) if an invoice exists.","category":"definitional","topic":"LTST Calculation"}
{"instruction":"Can we perform SSP allocations at the POB level (e.g., carve out amounts from a SaaS POB to reallocate to Services)?","response":"No, Zuora Revenue currently supports SSP allocation at the line level. Assessing whether a SaaS item falls within the SSP range at the POB level to prevent allocations is not supported out-of-the-box.","category":"definitional","topic":"SSP Calculation"}
{"instruction":"Why are forecast schedules not generating during the data collection process in UAT?","response":"Forecast schedules update during data collection only for the contracts touched by that collection. For other contracts, the Forecast Master Job must be run. Ensure the `ENABLE_FORECAST` profile is enabled. In some versions, you may need to set the `Forecast RTP enabled` profile to 'N'.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Forecast Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Are amount-based bundle splits or dynamic bundling supported?","response":"Fixed-price type bundle splits are supported. However, dynamic bundling (changing bundle composition on the fly) is not supported.","category":"definitional","topic":"Bundle Splits"}
{"instruction":"Can we use `TA_BATCH_SIZE` to split Transfer Accounting files into smaller chunks (e.g., 2k lines)?","response":"No, `TA_BATCH_SIZE` controls internal processing threads, not file splitting. File splitting is available for specific connectors (like NetSuite) but not for generic GL CSV extracts. For generic extracts, splitting must be handled by middleware or customization.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Transfer Accounting Batch Size"}
{"instruction":"Can users update fields like Amount or Cancel Flag via the UI instead of using an SO Update?","response":"It is generally not recommended or allowed for Amount/Price fields because changes must trigger allocations, which the UI update may not properly initiate. Similarly, updating the Cancel Flag to 'Y' via UI may not trigger necessary downstream actions.","category":"best_practice","topic":"UI Field Updates"}
{"instruction":"What is the processing sequence between Stage Validation and Bundle Explosion?","response":"Bundle explosion happens first, followed by stage validation on all lines (including the newly split bundle lines).","category":"definitional","topic":"Processing Sequence"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for Linking/Delinking, and does it trigger summarization automatically?","response":"Before delinking, ensure revenue is deferred and the Revenue Contract (RC) is unfrozen. Summarization is automated internally, so you do not need to manually trigger it for reports or the Close Process Dashboard (CPD). If an upsell line comes in for a delinked RC, it will typically form a new RC rather than joining the delinked one.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Link/Delink"}
{"instruction":"Is there a performance concern with having a high number of GL segments (e.g., 12-45)?","response":"Generally, no. Customers with ~32 segments and volumes of 1,200 to 20,000 journal entries per run operate successfully, though performance tuning may be required for very high volumes.","category":"best_practice","topic":"GL Granularity"}
{"instruction":"Is Ramp Allocation supported for usage charges?","response":"No, usage charges are not supported in Ramp Allocation. This is a known system limitation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Ramp Functionality"}
{"instruction":"Can we trigger Contract Impairment Type 5 (Retrospective) in an OTR environment?","response":"Retrospective impairment (Type 5) generally does not produce an impairment amount because the retrospective allocation reshuffles the Total Contract Value (TCV) across all lines. While it may work with manual RORD uploads, it often does not trigger as expected in OTR flows due to this behavior.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Contract Impairment"}
{"instruction":"What is involved in changing a fiscal calendar (e.g., from Jan-Dec to Feb-Jan) for an existing customer?","response":"Changing the fiscal calendar for an existing customer is complex and treated as a mini-project requiring Global Services (GS) and COE. It involves custom patching and has a wide impact. A potential strategy is creating a 13-month transition year rather than using a stub period, but backdating changes is difficult.","category":"procedural","topic":"Fiscal Calendar Change"}

{"instruction":"How can we exclude lines with a value less than $10,000 from SSP analysis?","response":"You can add a filter in the SSP Analyzer for 'Ext Sell Price > 10000'. Ensure the field you are filtering on is included in the current view.","category":"procedural","topic":"SSP Analyzer"}
{"instruction":"Is there a standard report or script to generate a Historical Waterfall?","response":"The Waterfall is a snapshot in time; the system does not persist deleted snapshots to recreate history. A historical waterfall can be built using BI view schedules if the data has been exported to a data warehouse, but it is not available as a standard retroactive report within the application.","category":"definitional","topic":"Historical Waterfall"}
{"instruction":"Can we upload a custom file to Zuora Revenue via API?","response":"Yes, you can use the `POST_UploadFile` API. You must provide the name of the template in the API request headers.","category":"procedural","topic":"API File Upload"}
{"instruction":"If multiple contract modifications occur in a period, can we force 'Prospective' treatment if one of them triggers 'Retrospective'?","response":"No, if any modification in the period triggers Retrospective treatment (e.g., a term change or price reduction that reduces recognized revenue), Retrospective treatment will prevail for the contract in that period.","category":"definitional","topic":"Contract Modification Treatment"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle missing invoices from a prior fiscal year that need to be processed now?","response":"In Zuora Revenue, the invoice period corresponds to the month the data is processed. It is recommended to process these as catch-up transactions in the current period to avoid reopening closed periods, which can cause reconciliation and audit issues.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Prior Period Invoices"}
{"instruction":"How can we report on the difference in functional deferred balances caused by FX rate differences between Invoice and Credit Memo?","response":"There is no out-of-the-box report for comparing FX differences between Invoices and Credit Memos. The Unbilled FX report compares Sales Order vs. Invoice rates. Zuora Revenue generally expects upstream systems to handle FX gain/loss matching.","category":"definitional","topic":"FX Reporting"}

{"instruction":"Why does the sandbox self-refresh process stick at 99% for a long time?","response":"This is normal behavior. The process reaches 99% after data copy, but index creation occurs at the end. Index creation is a time-consuming task that does not update the percentage progress bar, making it appear stuck.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"How can we prevent double revenue recognition if the Usage Master Process is run twice simultaneously?","response":"You can enable the 'Incompatible with All' setting for the Usage Master Process in the Background Jobs configuration. This will prevent concurrent executions. This feature is expected to be available in an upcoming release.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Master Process"}
{"instruction":"Does the Audit Trail report capture new configuration additions (e.g., new DA rules)?","response":"Currently, the Audit Trail report only captures updates and deletions. An enhancement (ZR-43500) has been logged to include insertions (new records) in the report.","category":"informational","topic":"Audit Trail"}
{"instruction":"Why is a $0 sell price line with a carve-in amount not releasing revenue upon event upload?","response":"A $0 line should still release revenue if it has an allocated amount.

{"instruction":"How can I implement Swiss QR Bills on Zuora invoices?","response":"Swiss QR bills can be implemented using the HTML Invoice Template features. You can embed a JavaScript library (such as `kjua.min.js`) within the HTML template to generate the specific QR code required. Note that standard Zuora barcode merge fields generally do not support the specific characters or format required for Swiss QR specifications, so the JavaScript approach is the recommended best practice. The QR code encodes payment details (IBAN, reference, amount) to be scanned by banking apps.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Swiss QR Bill"}
{"instruction":"How long does an invoice generated by an Invoice Schedule remain in 'Draft' status?","response":"An invoice generated via an Invoice Schedule will remain in 'Draft' status indefinitely until it is explicitly posted. It can be posted manually via the UI, or automatically using a Workflow or API call. There is no automatic expiration or cancellation of these draft invoices.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to generate a preview of invoice data (e.g., for a Bill Run) without creating the actual Invoice objects in the database?","response":"Yes, you can use the 'Billing Preview Run' functionality. This can be executed via the API or a Workflow task. It generates the billing data (available as a CSV or queryable table) allowing you to see what would be invoiced without creating the legal Invoice records or incrementing invoice numbers.","category":"how_to","topic":"Billing Preview"}
{"instruction":"When will the 'Custom Logic' feature be Generally Available (GA)?","response":"As of late 2024, the target for General Availability (GA) of Custom Logic is February 2025. It is currently in Early Adopter (EA) phase. Entitlements (number of allowed definitions) will likely vary by Zuora edition (e.g., 5, 10, or 20 definitions).","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom Logic"}
{"instruction":"What is the impact of updating the Chart of Accounts (COA) on existing transactions?","response":"Updating the Chart of Accounts (COA) or accounting codes in Zuora settings does not retroactively update existing transactions (neither Draft nor Posted). The new settings will only apply to future transactions generated after the change. For this reason, it is best practice to perform COA updates after an accounting period close.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Finance/GL"}
{"instruction":"Can Payment Profiles and the legacy Advanced Payment Manager (APM) feature run simultaneously during a migration?","response":"Running both simultaneously is not recommended by Product as it has not been fully tested and may lead to conflicts. Specifically, APM typically requires the account-level `autoPay` flag to be `false`, whereas Payment Profiles often expects `true`. Additionally, payment runs with Payment Profiles enabled might bypass certain legacy autopay checks.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payment Profiles"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit to the number of Organizations (Orgs) allowed in a Multi-Org tenant?","response":"There is no hard physical limit documented, but there are practical limits regarding manageability (e.g., switching contexts in the UI, managing close processes for each org). A setup with around 30 Orgs is known to be supported and functional.","category":"definitional","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended way to delete billing transactions (invoices, payments) in a Production environment?","response":"You should never delete transactions in a Production environment. Best practice is to remove the 'Delete' permission from all user roles in Production. Instead of deletion, use reversal transactions such as Credit Memos, Debit Memos, or Refunds to correct balances and maintain a proper audit trail.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Integrity"}
{"instruction":"How can I prevent the generation or posting of $0 invoices?","response":"Zuora Billing generally requires an invoice to be generated to update the 'Charged Through Date' of the subscriptions, even if the amount is $0. To prevent sending these to customers, you can configure the Bill Run to generate invoices in 'Draft' status, and then use a Workflow to identify $0 invoices, cancel them (or leave them as draft/posted without emailing), and post the positive value invoices.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"Why am I receiving 'Operation failed due to lock competition' errors when calling unpost/cancel APIs?","response":"This error occurs when multiple concurrent processes attempt to update the same object (e.g., Account or Invoice) simultaneously. This often happens if you are making rapid API calls to unpost and then immediately cancel an invoice, as tax calculation or other background processes may still be holding a lock. To resolve this, ensure serial processing for operations on the same entity or introduce delays/retries.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"API Concurrency"}
{"instruction":"Why is the `paymentTerm` field missing from the response when querying the Invoice object via API?","response":"The `paymentTerm` field on the Invoice object is only populated if the invoice has a specific payment term that overrides the Account level term. If it is null, the invoice inherits the Account's payment term. To get the effective payment term in a query, you should select `paymentTerm` from the Invoice and also expand the Account object to select `account.paymentTerm` as a fallback.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"API/Data Query"}
{"instruction":"Is there an API to retrieve a list of all Reports defined in a Zuora tenant?","response":"Yes, you can use the Reporting API endpoint: `GET /reporting/api/rest/v1/reports/search?query=%` to retrieve a list of all report definitions.","category":"how_to","topic":"Reporting API"}
{"instruction":"How do I configure a subscription that invoices for a specific number of 'issues' (e.g., magazines) and then converts to time-based billing?","response":"A recommended approach is to use a Prepaid with Drawdown charge model for the 'issues' (setting the validity period to 1 year or similar). You can then use Workflow to monitor the balance; when the prepaid balance reaches zero, the Workflow can trigger an Order to add a new time-based Rate Plan and remove the prepaid plan.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Charge Models"}
{"instruction":"How can I handle seasonal billing where a customer does not pay during specific months (e.g., winter) but the contract remains active?","response":"Do not use the 'Suspend' subscription action, as this stops billing generation entirely and may not reflect the contract state correctly in all metrics. Instead, use an Amendment (or Order Action) to apply a discount (e.g., 100% or reduced rate) for the specific seasonal months. This keeps the subscription active and generating invoices (at $0 or reduced value) for the seasonal period.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Seasonal Billing"}
{"instruction":"Does the NetSuite Connector support Zuora Multi-Entity?","response":"Yes, but it requires a separate connector instance configuration for each Zuora Entity. You cannot manage multiple Zuora entities with a single NetSuite Connector instance.","category":"integration","topic":"NetSuite Connector"}
{"instruction":"How can I specify the processing order of multiple discounts (e.g., applying a Rate Plan discount before a Subscription level discount)?","response":"You can control the order of discount application by using 'Discount Classes'. Assign different classes to your discounts and define the application hierarchy in your tenant settings.","category":"how_to","topic":"Discounts"}
{"instruction":"How can I link Scheduled Orders to their Subscriptions in Data Query?","response":"The relationship is stored in the `OrderAction` table. You can join `Order` to `OrderAction` and then to `Subscription`. Note that a Scheduled Order might not link to a specific subscription version until it has actually executed.","category":"how_to","topic":"Data Query"}
{"instruction":"Can Order Line Items (OLI) be invoiced separately from Subscriptions?","response":"Yes. You can control this via the Billing Rule 'Allow to consolidate subscriptions, order line items and standalone invoice items...'. If you need granular control to separate them, you can also use the `InvoiceGroupNumber` field on the items to force them into different invoices.","category":"how_to","topic":"Order Line Items"}
{"instruction":"I am unable to load more than 50 records into a Custom Object using Data Loader. What is the solution?","response":"If Data Loader is failing for bulk Custom Object imports, try using the native CSV Import feature found directly on the Custom Object definition page in the Zuora UI. This uses the Bulk API backend and is often more robust for larger datasets than the standard Data Loader tool.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Loader"}
{"instruction":"Are Invoice Schedules supported for Evergreen subscriptions?","response":"No, Invoice Schedules are not supported for Evergreen subscriptions. They require a defined Total Contract Value (TCB) or fixed term to generate the schedule, which Evergreen subscriptions do not have.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Schedules"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the Payment Method on a Subscription via API if the 'update subscription' call doesn't support it?","response":"You should use the Payment Profiles API (`PUT /v1/payment-profile`) to manage payment method associations. Alternatively, you can update the default payment method on the Account level, which applies to all subscriptions that do not have a specific override.","category":"how_to","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"How can I create a custom field on a standard object (e.g., Account) via API?","response":"You can use the Settings API (specifically `POST /settings/definitions`) to create custom fields programmatically. This endpoint is documented in the Knowledge Center under 'Manage Custom Fields' rather than the main API reference.","category":"how_to","topic":"Settings API"}
{"instruction":"Can I enable Invoice Settlement Harmonization (ISH) on a tenant that does not have Orders enabled?","response":"No, Invoice Settlement Harmonization generally requires Orders (or Order Harmonization) to be enabled first. It is part of the modern billing stack that moves away from the legacy Subscribe & Amend and Invoice Item Adjustment models.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can I send different email notifications for Autopay vs Manual payments if I can't create duplicate notifications for the 'Payment Processed' event?","response":"Instead of creating duplicate notifications, use a single notification for the 'Payment Processed' event and use the `Payment.Source` field (e.g., filtering for 'PaymentRun') to distinguish autopay events. You can use advanced merge field conditionals (if/else logic) within the HTML email template to dynamically change the email content based on whether it was an autopay or manual payment.","category":"how_to","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"What should a customer do if they are currently on 'Order Harmonization' and want to move to 'Full Orders'?","response":"Since the 'Subscribe & Amend' model is being deprecated, customers on Order Harmonization (which supports both models) should transition to Full Orders. This typically involves disabling the 'Order and Subscription Co-existence' setting in the tenant to enforce the Orders UI and API behavior exclusively.","category":"strategy","topic":"Orders Migration"}
{"instruction":"Why does the 'Payment Term' on a posted invoice appear to change when I update the Account's payment term?","response":"This is a UI behavior. If the `PaymentTerm` field on the Invoice object is null, the Zuora UI dynamically displays the Account's current payment term. The actual data on the Invoice record has not changed. You can verify this by checking the invoice record via Data Query or API.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"UI Behavior"}
{"instruction":"Does the AQuA API support the 'IN' clause in ZOQL queries?","response":"No, standard AQuA ZOQL does not support the `IN (...)` operator. You must construct your query using `OR` conditions (e.g., `Status = 'Active' OR Status = 'Cancelled'`).","category":"limitations","topic":"AQuA API"}
{"instruction":"Can I repoint an existing Refund to a different Credit Memo?","response":"No. A refund is permanently linked to the Credit Memo (or Payment) from which it was created. To 'move' it, you must cancel the original refund and create a new refund linked to the correct object.","category":"how_to","topic":"Refunds"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora's out-of-the-box email server support DKIM?","response":"No, the default internal email server does not support DKIM. To use DKIM, you must configure the 'Advanced SMTP' server feature (which uses Amazon SES) or use an external SMTP server.","category":"technical","topic":"Email Deliverability"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between the 'Invoice Posted' and 'Invoice Posted (Custom Event)' notification events?","response":"'Invoice Posted' refers to the legacy, hardcoded notification event. 'Invoice Posted (Custom Event)' refers to the event trigger built on the newer Event Framework (Notifications 2.0), which offers more flexibility. In the new UI, standard events may also be labeled with their ID (e.g., '1110 - Invoice Posted').","category":"definitional","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Is there a public API to update Payment Gateway credentials (e.g., Client ID/Secret)?","response":"No, Zuora does not expose sensitive gateway credential fields via the public API for security reasons. These must be updated via the Zuora UI.","category":"limitations","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to report on Net MRR?","response":"The recommended approach is to use the `ChargeMetrics` table (which provides Net MRR per charge) or `OrderDeltaMrr` (which provides the change in MRR per order). Avoid using `RatePlanCharge.MRR` as it reflects gross MRR and does not account for discounts.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle Zuora 360/CRM Sync during a large data migration?","response":"It is best practice to disable the real-time sync during large data loads (e.g., >150k records) to prevent throttling and performance issues. You can do this by disabling the sync settings or by populating the `CRM ID` field with a dummy prefix during load (so the connector ignores them) and then updating/unmasking them later to sync.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can I group usage records by a custom field on an HTML invoice template?","response":"You can use the `GroupBy` filter in the merge field syntax within your HTML template. For example: `{{#InvoiceItems|FlatMap(ProcessedUsages)|GroupBy(Usage.CustomField__c)...}}`.","category":"how_to","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"Why are cancelled accounts not syncing to Salesforce via Zuora 360?","response":"By default, Zuora 360 may delete or stop syncing cancelled objects. To retain them, you must enable the specific tenant permission `CanceledAccountSync` (for legacy 360) or the equivalent Cauldron setting (for the new CRM connector).","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"Why do the monthly billed amounts vary for an Annual Charge using the 'Annual List Price' billing period?","response":"When using 'Annual List Price' based billing with monthly installments, Zuora calculates the monthly amount to ensure the total equals the annual price exactly. Due to rounding (e.g., 100 / 12 = 8.33...), some months may be adjusted by a penny (e.g., 8.34) to act as a 'true-up'. This is expected behavior.","category":"definitional","topic":"Billing Logic"}
{"instruction":"How can I migrate a Zuora-to-NetSuite integration to a new NetSuite instance for a large volume of data?","response":"Migrating a live integration for high volumes (e.g., 400k accounts) is high risk. The recommended approach is to batch the updates. Update the integration status fields (e.g., `NetSuite Integration Status`) in Zuora for a batch of records (e.g., 25k) to 'Error' or blank to trigger the connector to pick them up as 'new/updated', let the sync run, and then repeat for the next batch.","category":"best_practice","topic":"NetSuite Integration"}
{"instruction":"Is there a resource for configuring the new Salesforce CPQ Connector v2?","response":"Yes, there are setup guides and videos available (referenced internally as 'Salesforce CPQ Connector Install Guide and Testing Steps') that detail configuration and testing for the new v2 connector.","category":"resource","topic":"Salesforce CPQ Connector"}
{"instruction":"Can a customer change their tenant name on their own?","response":"A customer can update the display name (the banner name shown in the UI) themselves via the Tenant Profile Settings. However, changing the actual tenant name (used in OneID and backend systems) requires a support ticket.","category":"administrative","topic":"Tenant Management"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the Revenue GL fields on a Product Rate Plan Charge via API after an OTR (Order to Revenue) integration?","response":"You should use the PUT operation on the Product Rate Plan Charge object (/v1/object/product-rate-plan-charge/{id}). \n\nNote: The older PUT_RevProAccountingCodes API is considered legacy/deprecated in favor of the data backfill processes available in the UI or via API templates.","category":"technical","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to trigger an event or notification immediately when a new Invoice PDF is generated?","response":"No, Zuora does not currently support a real-time event trigger specifically for the generation of an invoice PDF file. \n\nWorkaround: You can implement an asynchronous solution using a Workflow that runs a Data Query periodically (e.g., hourly). The query should target the InvoiceHistory object to identify records indicating PDF generation or regeneration, and then trigger the desired downstream notification.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"How can we handle statutory reporting in a foreign currency (e.g., GBP) for a US-based entity whose home currency is USD?","response":"Zuora's standard reporting is based on the tenant's Home Currency. \n\nOptions:\n1.  Multi-Org: If you have Multi-Org enabled, you can configure a secondary reporting currency.\n2.  External Reporting: For single-tenant/non-Multi-Org setups, you must handle this outside of Zuora. You can use Data Query to export the transaction data and apply FX conversion (convertfx function exists in DQ, but is limited) in an external Data Warehouse. Standard Trial Balance reports in Zuora cannot be generated in a non-home currency.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Reporting"}

{"instruction":"How do I convert an existing Invoice HTML Template into a Credit Memo Template?","response":"There is no direct \"convert\" button. You must export the Invoice Template JSON and manually find/replace specific terms before importing it as a new Credit Memo template.\n\nKey Replacements:\n*   Invoice → CreditMemo\n*   InvoiceItems → CreditMemoItems\n*   InvoiceDate → MemoDate\n*   InvoiceNumber → MemoNumber\n*   DueDate → MemoDate (usually)\n\nNote: Merge fields differ slightly, so validation errors during import usually indicate missed replacements.","category":"procedural","topic":"Templates"}
{"instruction":"How should I configure billing if a customer wants specific subscriptions to bill on specific days (e.g., the 17th and 20th), rather than using the Account's Billing Cycle Day?","response":"Do not rely on changing the Account's Billing Cycle Day (BCD) dynamically. Instead:\n\n1.  Charge Configuration: Configure the charges on the subscriptions to use Charge Trigger Day or Specific Day of Month (e.g., set the billing day to the 17th or 20th explicitly on the charge).\n2.  Bill Run: Schedule the Bill Run to run daily and select all Billing Cycle Days (or use a broad filter). \n\nThe Bill Run will evaluate the account daily but will only generate invoices for charges that are actually due based on their specific configuration.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can I trigger a notification based on a future date (e.g., Charge Effective Date)?","response":"You cannot use standard \"Custom Events\" to trigger on a future date because they fire immediately upon evaluation. \n\nSolution: Use Custom Scheduled Events. These check conditions daily and can trigger notifications relative to a date field (e.g., \"0 days before Charge Effective Date\"). \n\nUpdate: As of the 2025.Q1 release, a standard notification for Rate Plan Charge key dates is now available GA.","category":"technical","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"What data gets converted when enabling Invoice Settlement (IS) on a tenant?","response":"During the migration to Invoice Settlement:\n*   Negative Invoices and On-Account Credit Balance Adjustments (CBAs) are converted to Credit Memos.\n*   Payment/Refund Objects: PaymentApplication, PaymentPart, RefundApplication, and RefundPart records are created.\n*   Deprecated Objects: InvoicePayment and RefundInvoicePayment are deprecated in favor of the new application objects.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can I retrieve a list of all Report definitions and their Run History via API?","response":"You can use the Reporting REST API. Note that some endpoints may be undocumented or internal.\n\n1.  Report Definitions: GET /reporting/api/rest/v1/reports/search?query=%\n2.  Run History: POST /reporting/api/rest/v1/reportruns with payload {\"pagination\": {\"pageNo\": 0, \"pageSize\": 100}}. \n\nNote: This returns a CSV of run history.

{"instruction":"What is the best way to migrate tokenized payment methods from a gateway like Stripe or Chargebee to Zuora?","response":"The standard approach is to import them as CCReferenceTransaction payment methods. You can use the Generic Payment Method Loader to bulk import these tokens, mapping them to the customer accounts.","category":"procedural","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"Can Deployment Manager migrate Custom Reports that are based on Saved Data Queries?","response":"Yes, but with a critical dependency: You must migrate the Saved Data Query first. \n\nReports reference the Query ID.

{"instruction":"Does Zuora support detailed Journal Entries (per invoice/payment) sent to the ERP?","response":"Zuora's standard GL interface exports Summary** Journal Entries. \n\nWhile Zuora has underlying detailed objects (JournalEntryDetail), they are not fully exposed in Data Query or standard exports for direct ERP consumption. If a customer requires detailed JEs (often for regulatory reasons like the FEC file in France), the workaround is to build a custom Data Query report to extract transaction-level details and feed them to the ERP or external warehouse separately.","category":"definitional","topic":"Journal Entries"}
{"instruction":"How can I retrieve the current Net MRR at the subscription level using the Charge Metrics table in a Data Query, as my current query returns all previous versions?","response":"To retrieve the current Net MRR using the Charge Metrics table, ensure you filter for the currently active charge segments. You must include a filter for the charge metrics end date, specifically `cm.enddate >= current_date` (or a specific date). Additionally, filter for `s.islatestversion = true` and `rpc.islastsegment = true` to avoid summing previous versions.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Data Query Charge Metrics"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to report on invoice line items (specifically aggregating by product) in Zuora Analytics if the default data sets are non-summable?","response":"To achieve granular reporting by product in Zuora Analytics (when default data sets are non-summable), the recommended approach is to clone the default datasets in the Explorer Analytics dashboard and simply add the `Product Detail` field to the dataset. This allows for more granular results split by product.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Analytics Reporting"}
{"instruction":"How can the Vertex `taxAreaId` be mapped to a custom field in Zuora for downstream systems?","response":"The `taxAreaId` from Vertex is typically mapped to a custom field on the Contact object or the Product Rate Plan Charge.

It functions similarly to entitlements for custom objects and workflows.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Extension Studio Licensing"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to 'reset' an API Sandbox to a clean slate similar to a refresh?","response":"There is no 'reset' function for API Sandboxes comparable to a Central Sandbox refresh. The best workaround is to use Developer Tools (or APIs) to delete all Account objects, which will cascade delete children objects (subscriptions, invoices, etc.). This effectively clears the tenant data, although it is not a hard reset of configuration.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Sandbox Management"}
{"instruction":"How can I determine the maximum number of organizations allowed in a Multi-Org environment?","response":"You can view the limit in the Org Hierarchy Management settings under the 'Total Org Units Entitled' field. In Production, this is often set to 100, though Sandbox limits may be lower. Note that adding organizations adds overhead to processing (separate close and journal processes).","category":"Definitional","topic":"Multi-Org Limits"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to run a billing preview for a single customer to simulate a renewal invoice via API?","response":"Use the `POST /v1/operations/billing-preview` API. Avoid using `GenerateBillingDocuments` (unless you specifically need a PDF and plan to unpost/cancel the draft) or `PreviewOrder` (unless you need tax/order metrics specifically). The Billing Preview API is designed for this scenario.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Billing Preview API"}

{"instruction":"How can I link Journal Entry Items to transaction tables like Payment Applications or Invoice Items in Data Query?","response":"Data Query does not expose the `JournalEntryDetail` objects that contain the direct links. While `JournalEntry` links to `PaymentApplication`, `JournalEntryItem` does not directly link to `PaymentApplication`. You may need to rely on `ApplicationGroup` logic or use the summary level `JournalEntry` links, noting this is a known limitation in Data Query exposure.","category":"Technical","topic":"Data Query Joins"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected delay for Stripe India e-mandate activation?","response":"For recurring payments in India via Stripe, there is typically a ~26-hour delay for the mandate to become active to comply with e-mandate regulations (pre-debit notifications). Initial payments may remain in 'Processing' status during this window.","category":"Regional","topic":"Stripe India Payments"}
{"instruction":"How can we send a notification to a user when a Dev Tools job completes?","response":"Since Dev Tools does not send native email notifications, a workaround is to build a Workflow that queries for the expected data change (e.g., a specific field update on the last record) on a schedule and sends an email/text when the change is detected.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Dev Tools Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Does the 1000 amendment limit on Subscribe/Amend (S/A) apply to Orders?","response":"Yes, the limit is technically on the number of subscription versions (approx. 1000), not just amendments. Since Orders generate versions/amendments, the limit applies. Moving to Order Harmonization does not reset this count. The solution is to create a new subscription.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Subscription Limits"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement a Credit Card Surcharge fee flow?","response":"A common approach is to use a Workflow to calculate the surcharge fee, execute a payment, and potentially add a custom field for tracking. Alternatively, Custom Logic can be used.

{"instruction":"What determines if a usage record is picked up by an invoice?","response":"Usage records are invoiced indirectly via Usage Charges. The Usage Charge is picked up if the Bill Run Target Date is on or after the Charge End Date (for arrears/recurring). If the Target Date covers the period of the usage, and the rating period is closed/processed, the usage will be billed.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Usage Billing"}
{"instruction":"Can we avoid creating a separate Credit Memo for a return Order Line Item (OLI) and net it on the invoice?","response":"No, currently a return OLI will generate a separate Credit Memo. It cannot be netted directly on the invoice. This is a known request tracked by product.","category":"Limitation","topic":"Order Line Items"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to revert a Central Sandbox refresh?","response":"No, unless a specific backup schedule was arranged with Ops (which is not the default behavior), you cannot revert a sandbox refresh.","category":"Operations","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"Should we track Legal Entity segments at the Subscription level?","response":"It is strongly discouraged. Legal Entity should ideally be tracked at the Account level to ensure that downstream transactions (Invoices, Payments, etc.) remain within the correct entity and do not cross boundaries.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"GL Segmentation"}
{"instruction":"How can I update Product Rate Plan Charge tiers via API without knowing the Tier IDs?","response":"The QuickStart API handles this natively. Alternatively, the v1 `CRUD: Update a product rate plan charge` API can update charges and tiers without specifying Tier IDs if the payload is structured correctly with the tier data.","category":"API","topic":"Product Catalog Update"}
{"instruction":"Does a Central Sandbox refresh copy the Product Catalog?","response":"Yes, a Central Sandbox refresh includes a copy of the Product Catalog from production.","category":"Operations","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"Is there an API to regenerate an Invoice PDF?","response":"Yes, you can use the `PUT /v1/object/invoice/{id}` API with the field `RegenerateInvoicePDF` set to true. This is available via the Object API.","category":"API","topic":"Invoice PDF"}
{"instruction":"Why can't I segment Payment/Refund Journal Entries by Subscription fields?","response":"GL Segmentation rules typically link to Product or Account fields. Payments and Refunds do not natively join to Subscription fields in the GL segmentation engine, so you cannot segment JEs directly by subscription attributes.","category":"Configuration","topic":"GL Segmentation"}
{"instruction":"How can I track changes to the Bill Cycle Day (BCD) on an account?","response":"You can query the `auditobjectchangeevent` table where `objecttype = 'Account'` and `Attributeid = 'BillCycleDay'`.","category":"Reporting","topic":"Audit Trail"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for transitioning a customer to a new currency (e.g. Euro transition)?","response":"The standard approach is to recreate the account and subscription in the new currency. If Flexible Billing is enabled, you may only need to recreate the subscription with the new currency (Subscription level currency).","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Currency Conversion"}
{"instruction":"How can I handle upgrade/downgrade proration logic at the charge level?","response":"You can use Zuora Workflow to enforce specific proration rules by manipulating the charge trigger dates or applying override invoice rules. The 'ChangePlan' Order Action is another option, though it has limitations regarding Revenue Recognition integration.","category":"Configuration","topic":"Proration"}
{"instruction":"How can I include a future-dated Order Action (e.g., Add Product) in an email notification?","response":"You can use a merge field filter in the email template. For example: `{{#OrderAction.Subscription.RatePlans|FilterByValue(AmendmentType,EQ,NewProduct)}}` to target the specific rate plans added by the order.","category":"Templates","topic":"Email Merge Fields"}
{"instruction":"Why does a Central Sandbox refresh sometimes complete in 30 minutes?","response":"A short refresh time is normal if the source tenant (Production) has a relatively low volume of data.","category":"Operations","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"How can I implement HMAC authentication for S3 uploads in a Workflow?","response":"Implementing HMAC in Liquid is difficult due to newline/encoding issues. It is recommended to use a JavaScript task within the Workflow to construct the canonical request and generate the signature.","category":"Technical","topic":"Workflow S3 Integration"}
{"instruction":"What is the JSON format for the Trust.zuora.com webhook?","response":"The webhook sends a JSON payload consistent with StatusPage notifications, containing `page`, `incident` (with `name`, `status`, `affected_components`), and `meta` information.","category":"Technical","topic":"Trust Webhook"}
{"instruction":"Can I separate Workflow execution by Organization in a Multi-Org environment?","response":"Yes, if you execute a Workflow from a specific Org Unit (using the org selector or API header), it runs in the context of that organization, meaning API calls within the workflow will be scoped to that org.","category":"Multi-Org","topic":"Workflow Context"}
{"instruction":"Does Prepaid with Drawdown (PPDD) support Multi-Attribute Pricing (MAP)?","response":"It works for unit-based PPDD models. However, since MAP uses unbilled usage, you may not see overage/drawdown impacts until the bill run processes the usage at the end of the period. Currency-based PPDD with MAP is likely not supported.","category":"Configuration","topic":"Prepaid with Drawdown"}
{"instruction":"How can I bill a customer Weekly or Bi-Weekly if the Account BCD is different?","response":"You should configure the Billing Period on the Charge itself to be 'Weekly' or 'Bi-Weekly'. The Account BCD is primarily for alignment or batch filtering and does not dictate the frequency if the charge is defined otherwise.","category":"Configuration","topic":"Billing Frequency"}
{"instruction":"Does the Foreign Exchange Rates feature automatically update Product Catalog prices?","response":"No, the FX Rates feature is for converting transaction amounts (e.g., generating invoices in a different currency). Product Catalog prices are static and must be updated manually via UI or API for each currency.","category":"Definitional","topic":"FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"Where can I find documentation on field lengths for Zuora objects?","response":"Field lengths are documented in the API Reference (though sometimes scattered) and the older SOAP API Object Reference. There is no single unified document for all modern objects.","category":"Documentation","topic":"Field Definitions"}
{"instruction":"Can I display VAT in a different currency than the Invoice currency?","response":"This is a display-only requirement. You can store the FX rate on the invoice/account and use a custom invoice template to calculate and display the VAT in the local currency, but the invoice and posting in Zuora will remain in the invoice currency.","category":"Configuration","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"Which Zuora features are currently End of Life (EOL) or End of Support (EOS)?","response":"Collections is EOL. Features like Subscribe/Amend, Legacy AR objects (Credit Balance/Adjustments), and `overageRatedQuantity` are EOS. Certain Payments components and Platform features (Data Access Control, App Store Connectors) are also planned for EOS in 2025.","category":"Roadmap","topic":"EOL/EOS"}
{"instruction":"Why does the Bill Run Advanced Filter show a higher 'Total Accounts Processed' than expected?","response":"The 'Total Accounts Processed' count includes all accounts that were evaluated by the bill run, even if they were filtered out during the process (e.g., due to no usage or inactive status) and did not generate an invoice. This is expected behavior.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Bill Run"}
{"instruction":"What are the risks of using the standard Credit Card Fee Workflow?","response":"Risks include potential penalties from credit card networks (Visa/Mastercard) for non-compliant surcharging. Operationally, it relies on custom fields and works by canceling/recreating invoices, which can create noise in subscription history and audit logs.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Credit Card Fees"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'CreditCard' and 'CCRef' payment method types in Zuora?","response":"`CreditCard` type means Zuora stores the actual card details (vaulted). `CCRef` (Credit Card Reference) means Zuora stores a token or Customer ID (e.g., from Stripe) and does not hold the raw card data. Use `CCRef` for tokenized flows.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Payment Methods"}
{"instruction":"Why does Zuora return an error for an expired credit card even if the gateway might accept it?","response":"Zuora has a setting 'Validate credit card expiration date' that prevents payment method creation/usage if expired. However, even without this, gateways like Stripe typically reject expired cards. Some gateways (e.g., Orbital) might accept them, but Zuora's validation is often the first gate.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Validation"}
{"instruction":"How can I limit a company logo image uploaded to an HTML invoice template to appear only on the first page, given that I cannot use a URL?","response":"If the logo is an uploaded image rather than a URL reference, standard HTML/CSS in the template (like conditional logic based on page numbers) may not successfully restrict it to the first page because the image is embedded. A common workaround or requirement is to host the image externally and use a URL reference, which allows for better control via HTML/CSS visibility logic based on page numbering. Alternatively, check if the template structure allows for a specific 'First Page' header section distinct from subsequent pages.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle variances between invoices generated in Zuora (CUBR) and legacy system invoices during a migration?","response":"If invoicing parameters (Price x Quantity x Rate) are identical, variances should be immaterial (rounding). If variances exist, establish a threshold of acceptability. For differences within the threshold, perform a one-time cumulative adjustment. This can be done via an 'adjustment bill run' in Zuora Billing (creating standalone invoices or credits) using a custom field to identify the adjustment charge, which can then be mapped in Zuora Revenue to AR/Deferred or Deferred/Revenue as appropriate. Do not use this method for regular transactions.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Migration"}
{"instruction":"In Configurable Lockbox, if a bank file lacks an invoice number and comes in as an unapplied payment, can it be automatically applied to an invoice of the same amount?","response":"No, the lockbox feature itself does not support this 'smart' matching logic out of the box. To achieve this, you would need a Workflow (or external integration) to process the unapplied payments, find the matching invoice by amount, and apply the payment.","category":"procedural","topic":"Lockbox"}
{"instruction":"Is integration between Deployment Manager and GitLab supported?","response":"As of April 2025, integration with GitLab is not officially supported in Deployment Manager (only GitHub is referenced in documentation). It is on the roadmap but not yet supported.","category":"definitional","topic":"Deployment Manager"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for price uplift automation: Workflow or the Upload Tool?","response":"Workflow (WF) is often preferred and has been successfully implemented for customers (e.g., Chamberlain, iRobot) to handle price uplifts. The 'Batch Price Update' tool (Upload Tool) has limitations, such as lacking an option to make the price effective on the 'next billing day' and generally applying only to termed contracts, whereas Workflow can handle evergreen contracts and more complex logic.","category":"comparison","topic":"Price Uplift"}
{"instruction":"Can we filter invoices on the invoice page layout using a custom field from a related object (e.g., Account.EntityCountry)?","response":"No, you generally cannot use related object custom fields (like Account fields) as filters on the Invoice page list view. While you may be able to add them as display columns in the UI, they are not available for filtering. A support ticket may be raised, but it is currently a limitation.","category":"definitional","topic":"UI Customization"}
{"instruction":"What happens to the Credit Balance Adjustment (CBA) balance when enabling Invoice Settlement?","response":"When Invoice Settlement is enabled, the CBA balance is migrated and converted into a Credit Memo. There is no 'CBA balance' from that point forward. You can select the product that appears on this migration Credit Memo, so it is recommended to create a specific product/charge for this purpose to easily identify where the credit originated (and similarly for Bad Debt/Write-offs to ensure correct revenue handling).","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can we sync TCV and MRR calculated in Salesforce CPQ to Zuora Billing?","response":"If using the Zuora 360 sync (or the connector), data from the Rate Plan Charge object in Salesforce (often named `zqu__QuoteRatePlanCharge__c` or similar) contains these values. You can map these or sum them for specific dates. Alternatively, use the Salesforce CPQ connector to sync that data, mapping it into custom fields in Zuora.","category":"procedural","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora Tax or the Direct Avalara integration use the 'Bill To' contact for tax calculation instead of the default 'Sold To'?","response":"Zuora Tax allows for a billing rule to switch from SoldTo to BillTo. However, specifically for the Direct Avalara integration or changing the tax address basis within ZTax settings purely via configuration can be limited; confirm if the specific connector supports the 'Tax Address Source' setting or if a customization/rule is required.","category":"definitional","topic":"Tax"}
{"instruction":"Why would a Vertex V1 tax connector template return a 'Not Found' error when integrating with Taxamo?","response":"This error often occurs if the template references the wrong namespace (e.g., Vertex O Series) or if the connector run mode is incorrect. For Taxamo integrations, ensure the connector is configured correctly (checking if it's V1 XML or V2 JSON) and that the template matches the expected format for Taxamo. V2 is typically JSON-based.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Tax"}
{"instruction":"How can we model an Order Line Item (OLI) with tiered discounts (e.g., first unit free, second paid) without going outside Zuora?","response":"OLI does not support tiered pricing natively. A workaround is to use one-time charges to represent the booking, or model it as a subscription with a rate plan that has the tiered structure, but purely using OLI for this specific tiered discounting use case is unsupported.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Order Line Items"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer refund a subscription cancellation when the invoice contains multiple subscriptions?","response":"If an invoice contains multiple subscriptions, you cannot simply cancel/refund the single subscription via the basic 'cancel' button if it tries to reverse the whole invoice. The procedure is: 1) Create a Cancellation Order effective on the subscription start date. 2) Run a bill run to generate a Credit Memo for that specific subscription's charges. 3) Refund the Credit Memo to the payment method.","category":"procedural","topic":"Cancellations"}
{"instruction":"Can the Summary GL Connector for NetSuite support custom field mapping for Class and Line Memo?","response":"Yes, it is possible using Liquid syntax in the custom mapping configuration. For the Line Memo, you can append values like `{{JournalEntry.Number}} - {{JournalEntryItem.Type}}`. Mapping the 'Class' field is more complex and may require if/else logic in the Liquid code to determine the correct class based on product or segment data.","category":"procedural","topic":"GL Connector"}
{"instruction":"How can we structure a 39-month subscription where the billing period changes from Annual to a 15-month period for the final term?","response":"One approach is to create the subscription with a 39-month initial term. Use an amendment or ramp structure where the first two intervals are 12 months (Annual), and the third interval is explicitly set to a 15-month billing period (e.g., via a specific billing period setting on the charge or a ramp interval). Avoid creating separate short terms if revenue recognition relies on the total 39-month booking.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Subscription Design"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to filter invoices based on a custom field from the Account object using the page layout search/filter?","response":"No, while you can add Account custom fields as columns in the Invoice list view, you typically cannot use them as filter criteria in the UI. Filters are generally restricted to fields on the object itself (Invoices).","category":"definitional","topic":"UI Customization"}
{"instruction":"How can we handle a scenario where Zuora 360 only syncs the last segment of a subscription to Salesforce, missing split segments?","response":"This is a known behavior where Salesforce may only display the last segment of a version. There is no standard workaround within the standard 360 sync to force all split segments to appear as active distinct records if the sync logic prioritizes the latest state. Custom synchronization or reporting might be required to expose prior segment details in SFDC.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Zuora 360"}
{"instruction":"Does the HTML Invoice template support multi-lingual content in a single template?","response":"Yes, Zuora supports multi-lingual HTML billing document templates. You can configure merge fields and labels to dynamically display content based on the communication profile or locale of the customer, rather than creating separate templates for each language.","category":"definitional","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"How can we store Vertex tax fields outside of the standard Taxes tag in a custom field?","response":"If the standard integration does not support this, you may need to use the Object Query API (or Data Query) to retrieve the specific tax details and populate them into a custom field via a post-process update or workflow.","category":"procedural","topic":"Tax"}
{"instruction":"How can we ensure proration credits (from removal/cancellation) are auto-applied during a bill run with Invoice Settlement enabled?","response":"With Invoice Settlement, proration credits generate Credit Memos. If 'Auto-apply unapplied credit memos during payment runs' is enabled, they can settle invoices during a payment run. However, if not using Payment Runs, you must use a Workflow to auto-apply these Credit Memos to invoices. Note that if the invoice is settled/paid, the CM remains unapplied unless refunded.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"Why would Braintree 2.0 migration fail with CVV validation errors?","response":"This often happens if the gateway has 'Verify new Payment Method' enabled, which triggers a CVV check that fails because Zuora does not store/migrate CVVs. Ensure 'skipValidation' is set to true in the API call (if available/supported for the method) or work with the gateway to disable the strict CVV check for the migration batch. It may also relate to how tokens are generated and passed during the migration.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"Can we integrate Zuora with monitoring solutions like Datadog or Sentry?","response":"Yes, customers (e.g., Indeed, Cisco) have integrated these. It typically involves using the System Health API to pull status or Data Query to retrieve audit trail/log data, which is then pushed to the monitoring tool. There is no native 'plugin', so it requires an API-based integration or Workflow.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integrations"}
{"instruction":"How can we split an invoice for a new add-on charge from an existing subscription charge if the customer keeps the original invoice in draft?","response":"If the original invoice is in draft and a new charge is added, they will merge by default. To keep them separate, you can: 1) Post the first invoice before adding the second charge. 2) Use 'Bill Run Filters' to target specific rate plans/charges in separate bill runs. 3) Await a future feature (Q2 roadmap) that allows preventing invoices from merging into existing drafts.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"How can we handle the cancellation of a booked Order Line Item (OLI) prior to fulfillment/billing?","response":"If using OLI for booking, cancelling it before fulfillment can be complex. A recommended alternative for items like hardware or one-time services is to use a One-Time Charge (OTC) instead of an OLI. If the OTC is removed (via amendment) before the billing trigger date, it effectively cancels the booking without creating an invoice, working end-to-end.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Order Line Items"}
{"instruction":"Should we use HPP 2.0 or the Payment Form for a new implementation requiring multiple payment methods?","response":"Payment Form (PF) is generally recommended over HPP 2.0 as it was designed to display all available payment methods on a single page and is the newer solution (GA as of Q1). However, check for specific gaps like ReCaptcha support, Zuora Fraud Protection, or specific gateway support (e.g., EBANX) which might not yet be fully available in Payment Form.","category":"comparison","topic":"Payment Pages"}
{"instruction":"Why would 'Available to Credit' on an invoice show a negative amount after a subscription cancellation and bill run?","response":"This indicates a potential bug or configuration issue, often related to the 'Include billing engine credits in total available credit' setting. If set to 'Yes', the system might over-calculate the credit usage. It can also happen if a Credit Memo is generated for multiple invoices and the balance distribution logic fails.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"How do I resolve an 'Invalid Header' error when uploading FX rates?","response":"This error is usually due to file formatting. Ensure the file is saved as a standard CSV. Copying the contents to a plain text editor (Notepad) and saving as CSV often resolves hidden formatting issues introduced by Excel.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"How can we rename an existing Custom Field (API name) to free up the name?","response":"Officially, you cannot rename the API name of a custom field via the UI. The standard process is to create a new field, migrate data, and delete the old one. However, there is a non-documented API that can rename Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), though it historically had limitations with tax engine impacts. A fix for this is expected, but use with caution or consult support.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom Fields"}
{"instruction":"How can we pull future-starting rate plans into an earlier invoice (e.g., billing all 3 years of a term upfront)?","response":"To bill future-dated charges upfront, you generally need to set the Target Date of the Bill Run to cover the future period (e.g., 3 years out). If you need to selectively bill only specific charges, you can use Advanced Bill Run Filters to select those charges/subscriptions. However, you cannot easily pull a future charge into a *current* dated invoice without extending the target date of the bill run itself.","category":"procedural","topic":"Bill Runs"}
{"instruction":"How can we prevent over-crediting when an ad-hoc credit memo exists and the product removal date is subsequently changed?","response":"This is a process issue. If an ad-hoc credit memo was issued manually, the billing engine is not aware of it in the context of proration calculation when the removal date changes. You must manually manage this by verifying existing credits before processing the new amendment or adjusting the resulting credit memo to account for the ad-hoc one.","category":"procedural","topic":"Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"Can manual journal entries be created within Zuora Billing?","response":"Yes, you can create manual summary journal entries using the 'Journal Entry' object via the API or Data Loader. This allows you to bulk create journal entries directly in Zuora Billing.","category":"definitional","topic":"Finance"}
{"instruction":"Does the 'Zuora Connector for Salesforce CRM' (Cauldron) use SOAP or REST APIs?","response":"The connector primarily uses the SOAP API for continuous sync. However, for certain high-volume tasks or the new scheduled sync mode, it may utilize the Bulk API.","category":"definitional","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"What should I do if I get a 'ZOQL query is too long' error in an Export task?","response":"This error occurs when the query string exceeds 20,000 characters. Try reducing the number of fields selected or simplifying filters. Sometimes, simply logging out, clearing cache/cookies, and re-logging in can resolve transient issues with the query builder.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Exports"}
{"instruction":"Why does a Bill Run with Invoice Schedules fail with an error about documents not being posted?","response":"If you are using Invoice Schedules, the previous invoice in the schedule must be Posted before the next one can be generated. If 'Support bill run auto-post' is set to No, and the previous invoice is still in Draft, the bill run will fail. You must post the draft invoices first.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Invoice Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Can we create invoices in closed accounting periods during a data migration to apply accurate historical exchange rates?","response":"Zuora does not allow creating invoices in closed accounting periods. To use historical invoice dates (and thus historical FX rates), you must temporarily reopen the accounting periods, process the migration bill runs, and then re-close them. Ensure this is coordinated with finance to avoid impact on locked financial data.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can we force CPQ Quotes to recalculate previews in bulk?","response":"There is no native bulk recalculate button. You can use the `QuoteRecalculateController.JR_recalculate` class in a custom script, but it processes one record at a time and is asynchronous, making it non-trivial for large volumes.","category":"procedural","topic":"CPQ"}
{"instruction":"Does the Hosted Payment Method (HPM) page validate the State/Province field against the Country?","response":"Zuora's HPM checks that the State/Country codes match its internal list of valid ISO codes (e.g., 'TX' for Texas), but it does not perform a real-time address validation (e.g., checking if the Zip code matches the State). It is best practice to validate addresses via a 3rd party tool before passing data to Zuora.","category":"definitional","topic":"Hosted Payment Pages"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora vault SEPA details when using Stripe v2?","response":"Zuora does not typically 'vault' SEPA details (like IBAN) in the same way it vaults credit cards. It stores the data but primarily relies on the mandate/token (e.g., reference ID) generated by the gateway (Stripe) to process recurring payments. The stored IBAN in Zuora is often masked/encrypted and not sent in subsequent payment requests.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"If I change the accounting code on a product rate plan charge, does it affect historical invoices?","response":"No, changing the accounting code on the product/charge definition only affects invoices/revenue items generated *after* the change. Historical records retain the code that was active at the time of their creation. To update history, you would need to use the Mass Updater on the Revenue Items (if applicable) or manual journal adjustments.","category":"definitional","topic":"Accounting Codes"}
{"instruction":"How can I fix an HTML email template that renders in 'Internet Explorer compatibility mode' in Outlook?","response":"Outlook often uses the Word rendering engine which can behave like older IE versions. Adding meta tags like `<meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>` inside conditional comments `<!--[if !mso]><!--> ... <!--<![endif]-->` is a common attempt, but Outlook (mso) often ignores these. Inline CSS is the most reliable method for Outlook compatibility.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"How can I test 'expired credit card' functionality in My Account if I can't create a card with a past expiration date?","response":"You cannot easily create a card with a past expiration date in the UI/API. The workaround is to create a card expiring in the current month/year (or very near future) and wait for time to pass, or rely on simulating the *payment failure* response from a gateway rather than the expiration logic itself. There is no 'backdate' feature for expiration testing.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Testing"}
{"instruction":"How can we provide a 'grace period' for invoice payment without unposting/changing the due date?","response":"Handle this in the Dunning/Collections process. Create a custom field (e.g., 'GracePeriodDueDate') and update your dunning workflows to reference this field instead of the system 'Due Date'. This avoids modifying the immutable invoice record while delaying suspension/cancellation actions.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Collections"}
{"instruction":"What is the sequence of callouts for an 'Add Product' and 'Remove Product' order occurring on the same effective date?","response":"Callout sequencing cannot be guaranteed for multiple orders created/effective on the same day unless they are strictly serialized. They generally process in order of creation, but multiple queues can cause race conditions. For immediate deprovisioning, a single order or 'Revert' might be safer, or rely on the final state after all processing.","category":"definitional","topic":"Callouts"}
{"instruction":"How can we test System Health Notifications effectively?","response":"Many System Health alerts are triggered by failures (e.g., API failure, Workflow failure, Email bounce). To test, you must simulate these failures, such as intentionally breaking a workflow, sending an email to an invalid domain (though internal suppression might catch it), or triggering a bad API call. Performance alerts can be tested by temporarily lowering thresholds.","category":"best_practice","topic":"System Health"}
{"instruction":"Is there a native way to clone a subscription in Zuora?","response":"No, there is no native 'Clone Subscription' button or API. You must build a custom solution (Workflow or API integration) to read the existing subscription details and create a new one with the same parameters.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"Can we configure Configurable Lockbox to match payments to invoices if the bank file lacks a specific invoice number field?","response":"Configurable Lockbox has limited logic for parsing unstructured text to find invoice numbers. A better approach is to use a Workflow to ingest the file, parse the text using regex or logic to identify invoice numbers, and then apply the payments. Workflow offers more flexibility than the native Lockbox file mapping.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Lockbox"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to convert a Picklist custom field to a Text custom field?","response":"There is no automatic conversion. The official process is to create a new Text field, migrate the data, and delete the Picklist field. However, for Advanced Custom Fields, it may be possible to modify the metadata (removing the enum values) to effectively treat it as text, but this is a backend/engineering intervention and not a standard self-service feature.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom Fields"}
{"instruction":"Can we execute Custom Logic in Production while it is in Early Adopter (EA) status?","response":"Yes, Custom Logic can be enabled in Production environments upon request (via support ticket), provided there are no major blockers identified for your tenant.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom Logic"}
{"instruction":"How can we expose the Invoice PDF URL to a frontend application via API?","response":"You can use the `GetInvoicePdfStatus` API or similar calls to retrieve the `pdfFileURL`. This URL can be presented to the user, but ensure permissions and authentication context are handled correctly for the user accessing the link.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoices"}
{"instruction":"How can we trigger a workflow when a chargeback occurs?","response":"You can trigger a workflow based on the 'Payment Gateway Reconciliation' fields on the Payment object, specifically looking for status changes to 'Settled' or specific reason codes. Alternatively, look for the creation of an external Refund object with a reason code like 'Payment Rejection' or 'Chargeback', which is often how chargebacks are recorded in Zuora.","category":"procedural","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"How should we bill for Professional Services (milestones, hours) in Zuora?","response":"Professional Services can be billed using: 1) Invoice Schedules (for fixed milestones). 2) Usage records (where 1 unit = $1 or 1 hour) uploaded via API/file. 3) Standalone Invoices created via API. 4) Order Line Items (for revenue booking) combined with standalone invoices for billing. The choice depends on whether you need to recognize revenue differently from billing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Professional Services"}
{"instruction":"How can we handle Gift Cards in Zuora Billing?","response":"Model Gift Cards by creating a Credit Memo when the card is 'redeemed' or applied. Use a specific product for the Credit Memo that maps to a unique accounting code (e.g., 'Gift Card Liability'). This Credit Memo can then be applied to the invoice. Zuora does not manage the gift card balance/validity itself; that must be handled externally.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"Can we export Zuora Report results directly to SFTP?","response":"No, Zuora Reporting does not have an out-of-the-box feature to send report results to an SFTP server. You would need to build a Workflow or use an external ETL tool to retrieve the report data via API and push it to SFTP.","category":"definitional","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"How can we match payments to invoices after a lockbox load if the matching failed initially?","response":"If payments load to a dummy account or remain unapplied due to poor matching data, use a Workflow to iterate through these payments, apply logic to find the correct invoice (e.g., by amount, customer name, or secondary reference), and then use the 'Apply Payment' API to link them.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Lockbox"}
{"instruction":"How do I enable 'Delivery Pricing' in my tenant?","response":"The Knowledge Center may state it is self-service, but often it requires a support ticket to enable if the feature is not visible in 'Billing Settings'.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Pricing"}
{"instruction":"How long does Zuora retain customer data?","response":"Generally, Zuora retains core business data (Accounts, Subscriptions, Invoices) for the life of the tenant. There is no automatic archiving or deletion of this historical data after a set period. However, transient data like Workflow task history is retained for a shorter period (e.g., 45 days).","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Retention"}
{"instruction":"Can we disable the creation of $0 invoices?","response":"No, there is no global setting to strictly prevent the generation of $0 invoices if the billing logic results in a zero amount (e.g., 100% discount, free trial). They are generated as part of the audit trail.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"How can we display tiered pricing rows (e.g., 1-50 @ $3, 51-200 @ $2) on an HTML invoice template?","response":"You can iterate through the `RatePlanChargeTiers` object within the invoice template merge fields. Use conditional logic to display the specific tiers and their prices effectively. You may need to use advanced merge field syntax to filter/sort the tiers.","category":"procedural","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"What is the 'Bill recurring charges for subscriptions past end of term' setting?","response":"This setting (when set to 'Yes') allows Zuora to continue billing a subscription past its term end date, assuming it will renew. However, it is deprecated/not recommended because it can cause issues with ASC 606 revenue recognition compliance, as it generates invoices for periods not yet legally booked/renewed.","category":"definitional","topic":"Billing Settings"}
{"instruction":"Can we apply a fixed discount to each unit of a Per Unit charge?","response":"No, standard discount charges in Zuora typically apply to the total amount or are percentage-based. You cannot natively apply a 'fixed amount off per unit' (e.g., $5 off per license) using a standard Discount-Fixed Amount charge model against a Per Unit charge. You would need to use a percentage discount (calculated to match the amount) or a custom pricing model.","category":"definitional","topic":"Discounts"}
{"instruction":"How do we handle hardware fulfillment and invoicing when integrating with NetSuite?","response":"Since NetSuite often requires fulfillment before invoicing for inventory items (hardware), and Zuora might bill upon booking or a different trigger, a common pattern is: 1) Create the Order in Zuora (often via One-Time Charge). 2) Sync to NetSuite as a Sales Order. 3) Fulfill in NetSuite. 4) Use the fulfillment data to trigger the billing in Zuora (if bill-on-fulfillment) or simply sync the generated Invoice from Zuora to NetSuite, ensuring it links back to the Sales Order to close the loop.","category":"best_practice","topic":"NetSuite Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can we send an invoice to a customer N days before the actual invoice date?","response":"Use a scheduled Bill Run. Create a custom field on the account to define the 'lead time' (N days). Then, set up recurring scheduled Bill Runs that filter for accounts with that specific lead time and set the Bill Run's 'Target Date' to be `Date + N`. This effectively generates the invoice N days early covering the future period.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"How can we retry failed payments when using tokens?","response":"Retrying payments with tokens works the same as with raw card details. You can use the Configurable Payment Retry (CPR) feature or standard retry rules. The token (stored in the Payment Method) is used for the retry attempt against the gateway.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"How can we ingest Zuora Audit Trail logs into Splunk?","response":"You can use the Data Query API to extract audit trail records (e.g., `select * from AuditTrail`) and then push this data to Splunk's HTTP Event Collector (HEC) via a Workflow or an external script. There is no direct OOTB integration.","category":"procedural","topic":"Audit Trail"}
{"instruction":"Can we restore a Central Sandbox (CSBX) to a specific point in time?","response":"No, Zuora does not support point-in-time recovery or restoration for Sandboxes. You would need to rely on your own data backups and reload data via API/Data Loader if a rollback is needed.","category":"definitional","topic":"Sandbox Management"}
{"instruction":"How can we limit the quantity of an item sold (e.g., event seats) across multiple subscriptions?","response":"Zuora does not natively track 'global inventory' to limit sales across multiple subscriptions. You must handle this logic externally (e.g., in CPQ or the frontend) by checking the total sold count against a limit before allowing the quote/order to proceed. You can query Zuora for the total active quantity of that product to validate availability.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Inventory"}
{"instruction":"Can we use a Company Name in the Billing Contact First/Last Name fields?","response":"While Zuora requires First and Last Name, for B2B use cases where a specific person is not desired, it is best practice to enter the Company Name (e.g., First: 'Acme', Last: 'Corp') or use a generic value like 'Accounts Payable'. Some customers use 'Empty' or specific placeholders and then hide/replace them on the invoice template using a separate 'Company Name' custom field.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Contacts"}
{"instruction":"How can we extract detailed journal entry data (including segments) for Workday integration?","response":"The standard GL Interface often provides summary data. To get detailed entries with segment data, use Data Query to select from the `JournalEntryItem` table (joining with Account/Subscription fields as needed). Then use a Workflow to format this data and transmit it to Workday via API.","category":"procedural","topic":"GL Interface"}
{"instruction":"Can we update Prepaid Drawdown usage records after they are created?","response":"Yes, you can update usage records (including prepaid drawdown) via the API or Usage file upload by referencing the `UniqueKey` of the record. However, this is generally only possible *before* the usage has been invoiced. Once invoiced, the record is locked.","category":"procedural","topic":"Usage"}
{"instruction":"Is there a checklist or standard procedure for steps to take after a Zuora Billing central sandbox (CSBX) refresh?","response":"There is no single official exhaustive checklist, but several key actions are recommended. Standard post-refresh steps often include: (1) Re-configuring settings that are not preserved (e.g., usually payment gateways and tax engine credentials need re-entry, though some settings like SSO configuration for existing users may be preserved). (2) Provisioning users. (3) Updating templates and workflows if necessary. (4) Remapping invoice/credit memo PDF template IDs if they changed during the refresh (though typically these IDs should persist, some users have reported needing to remap them). It is noted that generally, CSBX refreshes bring over full configuration and transactional data from Production, but specific sensitive integrations (tax, payment gateways) often need manual reconfiguration.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"If I update Payment Retry rules to increase the allowable failures from 2 to 3, do I need to manually retry currently suspended customers who failed after 2 attempts?","response":"Yes, you generally need to take manual action for customers already in a suspended state. Simply changing the rule configuration usually applies to future payment attempts or active retries. Customers who have already hit the previous limit and entered a suspended status will likely not automatically re-enter the retry cycle without manual intervention or a manual retry attempt.","category":"procedural","topic":"Payment Retry"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to hide or conditionally disable the 'Post Invoice' button on a Bill Run or Invoice in the Zuora UI?","response":"There is no direct UI setting to conditionally hide or disable the 'Post' button for specific workflows while keeping it for others. Removing the 'Post Invoice' permission from a user's role will hide/disable the button for that user entirely. A suggested workaround for controlling posting via workflow is to have two user types: 'Billing Users' (who use the UI and have the 'Post Invoice' permission removed) and 'API Users' (used by Workflows, which retain the 'Post Invoice' permission to post invoices automatically via API upon workflow completion).","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"UI Customization"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer migrate from a Monthly List Price model to an Annual List Price model for existing subscriptions?","response":"There are two primary options: (1) Update the product catalog to Annual, then bulk update all existing subscriptions to remove the monthly rate plans and add the new annual rate plans. This is a heavy data migration effort with significant downstream revenue and CPQ impact. (2) Handle the transition at renewal: create a new version of the product (Annual) and systematically switch customers to the new annual plan upon their next renewal (e.g., via auto-switch logic or manual amendment). Option 2 is generally less disruptive but takes longer to fully migrate the base. Option 1 provides immediate alignment but requires heavy testing, particularly for Revenue and CPQ implications.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Pricing Migration"}
{"instruction":"Can I assign a specific language (e.g., French) for password reset emails sent to subscriber portal end users?","response":"Translation capabilities in the subscriber portal generally apply to the web presentation, not the system emails. To support multiple languages for password reset emails, you must create a combined email template (e.g., containing both English and French text) in the 'Look and Feel' settings, as there is no native feature to dynamically select the email template language based on the user's locale.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Why does a PayPal payment fail with 'MISSING_REQUIRED_PAR' during a payment run when the first payment worked fine?","response":"This error often indicates that the Payment Method created in Zuora is missing required token information or attributes needed for recurring transactions (Reference Transactions) via the PayPal Commerce Platform. If the payment method displays as 'PayPal Commerce Platform null', it suggests the tokenization process was incomplete or the billing agreement ID was not properly captured or mapped for subsequent recurring use.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"PayPal Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can I format the output of a Data Query `EXPLAIN PLAN` to be readable?","response":"You can use the `jq` command-line tool to format the JSON output. For example: `jq -r '.[\"Query Plan\"]'`. Alternatively, you can use `EXPLAIN (FORMAT GRAPHVIZ)` and view the result in a graph visualization tool.","category":"how_to","topic":"Data Query"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to use OAuth authentication for internal Zuora callouts (e.g., calling Zuora's own API via a custom callout)?","response":"While technically possible, OAuth for callouts is typically designed for external integrations. For internal Zuora API calls triggered by a callout, using Basic Authentication (username/password) or a dedicated API user is the standard and simpler approach. Configuring OAuth for internal loop-back calls adds unnecessary complexity compared to standard authentication methods.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Callouts"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora support co-terming subscriptions where the price is calculated based on rounded months (like Salesforce CPQ) while keeping accurate start/end dates?","response":"Zuora Billing does not have an out-of-the-box (OOTB) setting to calculate charges based on 'rounded' months (e.g., treating 10 months and 10 days as exactly 10 months for pricing) while simultaneously maintaining the exact legal start and end dates on the subscription object. Standard proration in Zuora uses exact days. Workarounds include custom implementations using Bill Cycle Day alignment or custom fields to store 'presentation dates' while manipulating the actual billing dates to achieve the desired price, but these are complex and require extensive testing.","category":"comparison","topic":"Proration Logic"}
{"instruction":"How can I remove a subscription-level custom field value from *all* previous subscription versions via API or Workflow?","response":"There is no single API call to update all historical versions of a subscription at once. You must identify all version IDs for the subscription and iterate through them. In Workflow, you can achieve this by performing an Object Query to retrieve all subscription versions (`Ids`), and then using an Iterator with a CRUD:Update task (using the `[*] ` syntax or iterating individually) to clear the custom field on each version.","category":"procedural","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"Is there a mass update API for creating Orders for multiple accounts at once?","response":"There is no single synchronous API endpoint that accepts a payload for multiple unrelated accounts. You must either (1) iterate through accounts and make individual Create Order API calls for each, or (2) use the Bulk API (Data Loader) to import a CSV file of orders for mass processing.","category":"procedural","topic":"Orders API"}
{"instruction":"Is Custom Logic (specifically for usage rating) GA or EA?","response":"Custom Logic is effectively in a state similar to Early Access (EA) or a controlled General Availability (GA). It is available in Production for multiple customers but may require Product Management approval to enable. The Knowledge Center (KC) stating it is 'Sandbox only' is outdated; it can be enabled in Production upon request.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom Logic"}
{"instruction":"How do I configure a Prepaid with Drawdown (PPDD) scenario where the customer is charged an Annual fee but receives Quarterly allotments?","response":"You cannot have a single charge with different validity (Quarterly) and billing (Annual) periods where the billing period is not a multiple of the validity period in the way required here. The recommended workaround is to split this into two charges: (1) An Annual Recurring Charge for the fee, and (2) A separate Prepaid Charge billed Quarterly at $0 to handle the quarterly unit allotment (validity).","category":"best_practice","topic":"Prepaid with Drawdown"}
{"instruction":"How can I manage deployment of Zuora workflows using Git version control?","response":"You can use the 'Deployment Manager' which supports integration with GitHub (Cloud or Enterprise). This allows you to manage Workflow definitions and Configuration Templates in a Git repository. For non-GitHub repositories (like GitLab), native support is not yet available, but you can build a custom integration using the Workflow Import/Export APIs.","category":"how_to","topic":"Deployment Manager"}
{"instruction":"Why is the subscription number being overwritten by the Opportunity Name when creating a subscription via CPQ X?","response":"This is often the default behavior in CPQ X plugin settings. You can change this configuration in the 'Default Value Settings' (within the CPQ Admin settings, distinct from Quote Studio settings) to prevent the Opportunity Name from mapping to the Subscription Number.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"CPQ X"}
{"instruction":"Do custom fields created directly in a Central Sandbox (CSBX) persist after a refresh from Production?","response":"No. A Central Sandbox refresh overwrites the sandbox with a copy of Production data and configuration. Any custom fields or objects created *only* in the CSBX (and not in Prod) will be lost after the refresh. Only specific preserved settings (like some SSO configs or pre-configured test user emails, depending on settings) are retained; schema changes are not.","category":"definitional","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"Can I set a specific tax accounting code on a Standalone Invoice via API?","response":"Currently, the 'Create Standalone Invoice' API does not support explicitly setting the accounting code for tax items directly in the payload in the same way you can for invoice items. The system typically applies default tax accounting codes based on the tax code configuration.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Standalone Invoices"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora Revenue have its own time zone setting?","response":"Zuora Revenue typically operates in EST (Eastern Standard Time) by default for its internal processing, distinct from the Zuora Billing tenant time zone setting.","category":"definitional","topic":"Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to prevent the 'Post Invoice' button from being active until a workflow completes?","response":"Not dynamically on a per-invoice basis via the UI. You can disable the 'Post Invoice' permission for users to prevent manual posting entirely, and then rely on a Workflow to perform the posting via API once all validations/steps are complete.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to delete deactivated users in Zuora?","response":"No, you cannot permanently delete users in Zuora, even if they are deactivated. This is to maintain audit trails (e.g., who performed past actions).","category":"definitional","topic":"User Management"}
{"instruction":"Can I import a Word-based mail merge template directly into the HTML Invoice Template editor?","response":"No. The HTML Invoice Template editor supports importing JSON files (which contain the HTML template structure exported from Zuora), but it cannot convert or import Microsoft Word mail merge templates (`.doc`/`.docx`). You must manually rebuild the template using the HTML editor or drag-and-drop builder.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"How does 'Batch Price Update' or 'Mass Price Update' handle evergreen subscriptions?","response":"Batch/Mass Price Update functionality has limitations with evergreen subscriptions, particularly regarding setting the 'effective date' of the price change to align with the 'next billing cycle' dynamically. It often requires a custom Workflow to calculate the correct effective date for each evergreen subscription and apply the update via Order/Amendment, as the native tool may not support 'End of Last Invoice Period' logic for evergreen subscriptions correctly yet.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Price Updates"}
{"instruction":"Can I consolidate multiple Credit Memos into a single Refund transaction?","response":"No, Zuora does not support consolidated refunds natively. Refunds are transaction-based and typically linked 1:1 to a specific Credit Memo or Payment. To refund a total amount from multiple CMs, you would typically need to issue separate refunds for each CM, or (workaround) create a standalone 'refund' payment or external refund, though this causes reconciliation challenges.","category":"definitional","topic":"Refunds"}
{"instruction":"How can we consolidate multiple Credit Memos or Payments into a single refund if the gateway enforces referenced refunds?","response":"If the gateway enforces referenced refunds (where each refund must be linked to a specific payment), it is impossible to aggregate them into a single refund transaction. A recommended workaround is to create a new standalone Credit Memo for the total refund amount, refund that via the gateway, and then create external refunds against the original individual Credit Memos or Payments in Zuora to balance the books.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Refunds"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to migrate a customer entity to a new tenant while retaining all historical data?","response":"Migrating an entity to a new tenant while keeping history is difficult. A 'Z-to-Z' migration often results in lost history. While Engineering may technically be able to 'pop out' an isolated entity, this is not a standard procedure. The recommended approach is usually to split the tenant or implement a cutover where history is archived rather than migrated.","category":"procedural","topic":"Tenant Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can we configure a drawdown model where the first set of units (e.g., 10) are free/included?","response":"You can configure a Drawdown Usage charge using the 'Overage Pricing' charge model. Set the included units to the desired free amount (e.g., 10). Combine this with a prepayment charge. This allows the first 10 units to be consumed for free, followed by drawdown from the prepayment for subsequent units.","category":"procedural","topic":"Drawdown"}
{"instruction":"How can we export Revenue Recognition Rule records since they aren't available in Export ZOQL?","response":"Revenue Recognition Rules can be retrieved using the REST API endpoint `GET /settings/revenue-recognition-rules`. They are not currently queryable via Export ZOQL or the Data Source Export.","category":"procedural","topic":"Revenue Recognition"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'Prerated Per Unit' charge model supported for Minimum Commitment features?","response":"No, the 'Prerated Per Unit' charge model is not currently supported for Minimum Commitment. Additionally, Minimum Commitment does not support proration.","category":"definitional","topic":"Minimum Commitment"}
{"instruction":"How can we disable Z-Tax calculation for a specific invoice, such as a migration invoice?","response":"There is no direct setting on the bill run or invoice creation to disable tax. A common workaround is to set the 'Tax Region' on the Sold-To contact to a value that maps to a 0% tax rate in your tax engine, generate the migration invoice, and then revert the setting.","category":"procedural","topic":"Taxation"}
{"instruction":"What should we do if a Data Query is hitting limits or timing out?","response":"Use the 'Index Join' feature. Ensure that the table in the FROM clause (the driver table) is relatively small. If filtering on Subscription status, it is often better to drive the query from the Subscription table rather than the Account table if the Account table has no filters.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Query"}
{"instruction":"Why can't I activate 'Suspend/Resume' jobs from the Business Automation Dashboard?","response":"The Business Automation Dashboard features for Suspend/Resume are currently de-documented and often function incorrectly (creating jobs in DRAFT/Inactive state). While APIs exist, the feature is considered unstable. Fixes are expected in future releases (e.g., Q2.1.0), but usage is currently discouraged.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Business Automation"}
{"instruction":"How can I find the API name for the Payment Gateway field on the Account object?","response":"Payment Gateways are not directly associated with the Account object; they are associated with Payment Methods. To update the gateway for an account's default payment method, you would check the `paymentGateway` field on the Payment Method object or via the `PUT Account` operation for the default payment method.","category":"definitional","topic":"Object Model"}
{"instruction":"How can I identify which user is triggering scheduled Bill Runs or Payment Runs?","response":"For scheduled Bill Runs, check the 'Created By' field in the 'Manage Scheduled Bill Runs' UI. For Payment Runs, open a PENDING run to see the creator. To change the user context, the job must be re-scheduled by the new user.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Scheduled Jobs"}

{"instruction":"How does Zuora calculate the Subscription End Date for a 13-month term starting Sept 30?","response":"Zuora calculates terms by adding the month count to the start date. For a 13-month term starting Sept 30, the calculation is Sept 30 + 13 months = Oct 30 (of the following year), not Oct 31.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Dates"}
{"instruction":"What is the performance impact of having hundreds of charges on a single subscription?","response":"Having hundreds of charges on a single subscription can lead to severe performance degradation in bill runs and the UI. It is recommended to keep the charge count lower (around 50) or split the subscription/account if possible.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Performance"}
{"instruction":"How can we visualize AI usage on a customer portal without charging the customer or changing rate plans?","response":"You can upload the usage to Zuora and rate it at $0 (using a $0 rate plan). This allows the usage quantity to be reported and visualized without generating a charge on the invoice. Alternatively, usage data can be aggregated in a custom object.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage"}
{"instruction":"How do I access the old Custom Field pages for configuration?","response":"You can access the legacy custom field pages by navigating directly to URLs like `{tenant_url}/apps/CustomField.do?menu=Z-Billing`.","category":"procedural","topic":"UI Navigation"}
{"instruction":"Why is my HTML template condition for excluding US and Canada always returning true?","response":"Using `country != 'US' OR country != 'CA'` will always evaluate to true. You must use `AND` logic: `country != 'US' AND country != 'CA'`.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling a 'buyout' or recovery payment for a written-off account?","response":"Do not cancel the subscription if you expect to resume billing. Instead, suspend the subscription. You can accept the payment as an unapplied payment and then create a standalone invoice or debit memo to offset it, or apply it to future invoices upon resumption.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Collections"}
{"instruction":"Why does the Orders API require an array of trigger dates (CED, SAD, CAD)?","response":"The Orders API uses an array for `triggerDates` to support different dates for different charges. Even if you only need one date (e.g., Contract Effective), the API structure often requires all three (Contract Effective, Service Activation, Customer Acceptance) to be explicitly provided in the array unless tenant settings allow them to auto-populate.","category":"definitional","topic":"Orders API"}
{"instruction":"Which permission controls the ability to 'Unpost' a Credit Memo?","response":"The ability to unpost a Credit Memo is controlled by the 'Cancel Posted Billing Documents' permission located under the Invoice section of the Billing Role settings.","category":"definitional","topic":"Permissions"}
{"instruction":"Why does the `/web-payments/sessions` API require an amount even when `processPayment` is false?","response":"The `amount` field is required to perform a validation authorization (auth-only) to ensure the payment method is valid. This amount is authorized but immediately cancelled and not captured. You can pass a standard small amount (e.g., 2.00).","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"How can we identify EU countries in an HTML invoice template without listing them all?","response":"There is no native 'EU' region flag available in templates. You must explicitly list the 27 EU countries in a conditional statement (e.g., using `Wp_Eval` with an array check) to display specific notes for EU customers.","category":"procedural","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"How do I create an Order for a subscription where the Invoice Owner is different from the Subscription Owner?","response":"When using the Orders API, specify the Invoice Owner's account number in the `existingAccountNumber` field of the Order header. Previous documentation referencing nested fields for this was incorrect.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Orders API"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement a 'Buy Now Pay Later' flow with partial upfront payment and installments?","response":"Create the Order with `runBilling` and `collectPayment` set to `false`. Then, create a Payment Schedule for the installment portion. Finally, trigger the upfront collection separately. Attempting to do all in one step via the Order API often conflicts because the Payment Schedule doesn't exist yet.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payment Schedules"}
{"instruction":"How can we mass close or delete payment methods?","response":"To delete, use the `Action Delete` API (limit 50 per call) or a Workflow designed to iterate and delete. To 'close' a payment method, you can use `Action Update` to set it to closed (note: this may require older API versions or specific fields).","category":"procedural","topic":"Payment Methods"}
{"instruction":"Is the QuickStart (v2) API being deprecated?","response":"The QuickStart (v2) API is not being deprecated or sunset, but it is in 'maintenance mode'. No new features will be added. New integrations should rely on the v1 API or the new Client Libraries (SDKs).","category":"definitional","topic":"API Lifecycle"}
{"instruction":"How can we prevent the generation of $0.00 invoices?","response":"There is no Out-of-the-Box feature to globally prevent the generation of $0 invoices.

{"instruction":"Which Payment Gateway Account Updater (PMU) should I use: Adyen or Cybersource?","response":"Adyen's Account Updater only works with the Adyen gateway. Cybersource's Account Updater is gateway-agnostic and can work across multiple gateways. If you have a multi-gateway strategy, Cybersource is recommended.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'Ship To Contact' feature work?","response":"You must enable the `ShipToContactSupport` permission. The 'Ship To' label in the UI only appears if a contact is explicitly assigned as the 'Ship To' contact on the account or subscription, not just because the contact exists.","category":"definitional","topic":"Contacts"}

{"instruction":"How can we send payment failure notifications to a third party (like Vindicia) after a specific number of retries in Zuora?","response":"Zuora does not have a native interface to send payment failures to external systems. You must build this integration, either near real-time via notifications or in batch via Workflow. Note that Zuora generates a new payment ID for each retry, so it does not 'retry' a single payment record in the strict sense. An example implementation (e.g., Hootsuite) involves using CPR for retries for a set period (e.g., 30 days), then extracting unpaid payments to the third party, and finally using a Workflow to cancel the subscription if still unpaid.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payment Retry Integration"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to update custom fields at the subscription level within the same Create Order API call used to create the subscription?","response":"Yes, it is possible to populate custom fields on the subscription object during the Create Order API call.

Best practice is to perform a post-refresh cleanup or sync just after a close and ignore any transactions that entered during the open period.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Sandbox Refresh Strategy"}
{"instruction":"How can we trigger a renewal or provisioning notification for a product sold without an electronic payment method (i.e., no payment success event)?","response":"You can use the standard renewal triggers (e.g., 'Subscription Renewed' or 'Order Action Processed') which fire for all renewals regardless of payment method, rather than relying on payment success events.","category":"procedural","topic":"Renewal Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Can we specify a partial payment amount directly in the OrderCreate API?","response":"No, the OrderCreate API does not support specifying a partial payment amount directly.

{"instruction":"How can we handle high-volume usage corrections (additions or reductions) via file upload?","response":"A recommended pattern is to use 'pre-rated' charges where you configure the rate plan with both a standard positive usage charge and a separate negative 'correction' usage charge. You can then upload negative values to the correction charge to adjust billing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Corrections"}
{"instruction":"What are the guidelines for implementing e-mandates for recurring transactions in India?","response":"Regulations in India are strict regarding data storage (PCI) and e-mandates. If collecting payment methods directly, merchants are often expected to generate the recurring mandate themselves. Refer to Zuora documentation on 'Processing of e-mandate on cards for recurring transactions in India' and Stripe v2 support for specific gateway implementation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"India E-Mandate"}
{"instruction":"How do I fix an HTML template error where the 'Localise' filter breaks comma formatting in a summed custom field?","response":"The `|Localise` filter is likely placed incorrectly inside a nested merge field. The correct syntax should place it outside the calculation logic, for example: `{{#Wp_Eval}}{{ByNetPricePerUnit__c|Sum(LineTotalAmount__c)|Round(2)}}|Localise{{/Wp_Eval}}`.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"HTML Template Formatting"}
{"instruction":"Why is AvaTax still applying tax even though I set 'Tax Exempt' to 'Yes' on the account?","response":"For AvaTax, setting the 'Tax Exempt' flag is not sufficient. You must also provide a valid 'Entity/Use Code' in addition to the certificate ID, as per the Knowledge Center documentation.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"AvaTax Exemption"}
{"instruction":"How can we bulk load subscriptions that contain RAMP deals?","response":"You should use the Orders API to bulk load subscriptions with RAMP deals. The standard Subscribe/Amend API or simple imports may not support the complexity of RAMP structures effectively.","category":"procedural","topic":"Bulk Load RAMP Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"Which Salesforce object should we use to report on forecasted MRR/ARR for both signed and unsigned quotes?","response":"Since Quotes contain MRR at a static point in time (and don't reflect billing lifecycle changes like renewals), it is recommended to use Zuora 360 sync to report on live subscription metrics from Salesforce. For unsigned business, you may need to report on the Opportunity or Quote objects, bearing in mind the static nature of Quote data.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Forecasted MRR Reporting"}
{"instruction":"What is the advantage of using an 'Estimated Start Date' versus a 'Specific Start Date' for pending subscriptions?","response":"The main advantage is that it allows a subscription to be created and activated even if the true start date is unknown. This enables you to perform actions on the subscription (like adding charges or cancelling) which might be restricted if the subscription were merely in a pending/draft state waiting for a specific date.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Pending Subscriptions Start Date"}
{"instruction":"Can a customer change their Home Currency (e.g., from AUD to USD) after implementation?","response":"No, the Home Currency is a one-time setting and cannot be changed once set. However, if the customer switches to Multi-Org, they can have different reporting currencies for different organizations.","category":"definitional","topic":"Home Currency Change"}
{"instruction":"Can we correct the order date for subscriptions in production via the backend if a workflow bug caused incorrect dates?","response":"No, you should not attempt backend data corrections. The best practice is to correct the data using standard billing operations, such as performing an amendment or a cancel-and-rewrite of the subscription.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Correction"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to use custom fonts in Zuora HTML email templates?","response":"Yes, it is possible by defining the font in the HTML/CSS (e.g., `font-family: 'MyCustomFont'`). However, this requires the email client to support the font or for it to be hosted publicly.","category":"procedural","topic":"HTML Template Custom Fonts"}
{"instruction":"Can we customize the naming convention of the GL outbound file in Zuora Revenue?","response":"No, the naming convention for GL outbound files in Zuora Revenue is not customizable.","category":"definitional","topic":"Revenue GL File Naming"}
{"instruction":"Does the Zuora Connector for SAP sync invoice PDF files to SAP?","response":"No, the SAP connector only syncs financial data (AR journals), not the actual invoice PDF files.","category":"definitional","topic":"SAP Connector PDF Sync"}
{"instruction":"Can we combine Prepayment with High Water Mark (HWM) usage billing?","response":"Unit-based Prepayment with Drawdown (PPDD) combined with HWM is generally not supported or logical because HWM applies to overage. Currency-based PPDD works if 'Unbilled Usage' is enabled (EA feature), but HWM has a limitation where it ignores price overrides and only uses catalog prices. A common workaround is to implement HWM logic in Mediation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Prepayment HWM Billing"}
{"instruction":"Is the Subscribe/Amend API being End-of-Life (EOL)?","response":"No, there is no EOL planned for the Subscribe/Amend API, but it is in maintenance mode and will not receive new features.","category":"definitional","topic":"API Lifecycle"}
{"instruction":"Does the Journal Run rollup to home currency use the transaction date's FX rate?","response":"Yes, if the transaction date exists and the system is set to use daily rates (without offset), the Journal Run uses the FX rate from the transaction date.","category":"definitional","topic":"Journal Run FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle a requirement where an SAP order sends a net amount, but the customer wants to track the Gross amount and a separate Discount line in Zuora?","response":"A recommended approach is to create a $0 discount charge in the Product Catalog and use a Workflow to update the subscription, adding the discount charge and adjusting the price to reflect the gross vs. effective (net) difference. Alternatively, middleware (like SAP PI/PO) can map the discount logic during the transformation before it reaches Zuora.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Order Discount Handling"}
{"instruction":"How can we handle multiple shipping addresses for hardware in a CPQ X quote?","response":"The 'ShipTo' contact feature is released in Billing but may not yet be fully supported in CPQ X. A common workaround is to use custom fields on the Quote Rate Plan or Quote Rate Plan Charge to capture the specific ship-to address for each line item. You can also filter Salesforce contact lookups by role to help users select the correct address.","category":"best_practice","topic":"CPQ X Shipping Addresses"}
{"instruction":"What controls can be put in place to ensure invoices are generated for all customers for compliance?","response":"Best practices include: 1) Ensuring all accounts are assigned to batches that have scheduled bill runs. 2) Configuring notifications for bill run completion. 3) creating a reconciliation report that checks active subscription charges to ensure their `chargedThroughDate` matches the current term start/end dates.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoice Generation Compliance"}
{"instruction":"How long does a Billing Preview run take, and where are the results stored?","response":"The execution time is linear and depends on the volume of data and the target date (dates further in the future take longer). Results are available in the `billingpreviewrunresult` table if the `storageOption` was set to Database.","category":"definitional","topic":"Billing Preview"}
{"instruction":"How do I fix an API filter error when using syntax like `plans?%filter[]=Channel__c.EQ:Digital`?","response":"The `%` symbol is incorrect. The correct syntax is `GET /v2/plans?filter[]=Channel__c.EQ:Digital`. Alternatively, using the Object Query API is often recommended.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"API Filter Syntax"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to generate a single payment link that covers multiple open invoices for an account?","response":"No, Zuora payment links are generated for specific invoices. There is no out-of-the-box feature to generate a single link that aggregates multiple invoices.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Links"}
{"instruction":"How can we suppress the automatic creation of a Credit Memo when cancelling a subscription billed in advance?","response":"A workaround is to set the cancellation effective date to the end of the current term (future dated) so no credit is due. If immediate cancellation is required without credit, you might need a workflow to manage the cancellation and refund logic explicitly, but standard immediate cancellation will trigger a credit for unused periods.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Suppress Credit Memo"}
{"instruction":"How can we remove the header row of a CSV file within a Workflow?","response":"You can use the CSV Translator task in Workflow and configure it to filter out the first row by row number.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow CSV Manipulation"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit to the number of subscriptions or accounts that can be assigned to a single Invoice Owner?","response":"There is no strict system limit for Orders tenants. Customers (like Edenred) have had tens of thousands of subscriptions on a single account. However, practical limits apply regarding invoice PDF generation size and timeout limits for external tax engines.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Owner Limits"}
{"instruction":"What is the syntax to link a discount percentage rate plan charge to a specific one-time charge via API?","response":"You need to use the `ProductDiscountApplyDetailData` structure in the API payload. Specifically, you may need to include the `AppliedProductRatePlanId` (which might be undocumented) to correctly link the discount to the target charge.","category":"procedural","topic":"Discount Charge API"}
{"instruction":"How can we map a Vertex Flex Field to a custom field on a Taxation Item?","response":"First, ask Zuora Support to enable Vertex flex fields for the tenant. Then, create a custom field on the TaxationItem object that matches the API naming rules defined in the 'Flexible Tax Mapping' documentation. The connector handles the mapping automatically if the names align.","category":"procedural","topic":"Vertex Flex Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Does the 'Enable Order for CPQ' setting need to be enabled if using Salesforce CPQ?","response":"No, that setting is typically for Zuora CPQ (related to Order Harmonization). It is generally not required for Salesforce CPQ integrations.","category":"definitional","topic":"CPQ Settings"}
{"instruction":"Can we create draft orders using CPQ X and Order Harmonization without being on the full Orders feature?","response":"Order Harmonization effectively enables Orders. Therefore, you can use Orders features like Draft Orders with CPQ X as long as Order Harmonization is enabled and CPQ X is configured to use Orders.","category":"definitional","topic":"CPQ X Draft Orders"}
{"instruction":"How can we query the latest invoice a payment is applied to, especially if it has been unapplied and reapplied?","response":"The `PaymentApplication` table provides the full history of applications. To see the *currently* applied amount/invoice, check the `PaymentPart` (or `InvoicePayment` object). For refunds, check `RefundPart`.","category":"procedural","topic":"Payment Application Query"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'Negative Usage' upload feature supported?","response":"No, the Negative Usage upload feature was in Early Availability (EA) but is no longer supported. The recommended workaround is to use two charges: one for positive usage and one for negative usage corrections.","category":"definitional","topic":"Negative Usage"}
{"instruction":"Can we update the comments on a Debit Memo without unposting it?","response":"Currently, you must unpost the Debit Memo (move it to draft) to update comments. However, an update to support this on posted documents is expected in an upcoming release.","category":"definitional","topic":"Debit Memo Comments"}
{"instruction":"Can subscriptions suspended by an Amendment (pre-migration) be resumed using an Order?","response":"No. Subscriptions suspended via Amendment must be resumed via Amendment (or the UI). Subscriptions suspended via Order must be resumed via Order.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Resume Suspended Subscription"}
{"instruction":"Why does the `v1/subscriptions/preview` API fail for USD but work for other currencies like GBP?","response":"This error occurs if the currency is not activated at the Product Rate Plan Charge level. You must go to the product catalog and 'Activate' the specific currency for that charge.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Subscription Preview Currency"}
{"instruction":"How can we build custom payment retry rules for a customer who hasn't purchased CPR (Configurable Payment Retry)?","response":"While you can use the basic default retry rules in Payment Settings, advanced logic must be built externally (e.g., via Workflow). For example, some implementations use Workflow to handle retries for specific methods like Credit Cards or PAD/ACH. However, purchasing CPR is strongly recommended to avoid high maintenance overhead.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Payment Retry"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to trigger a Bill Run Completion event only for specific batches (e.g., Batches='AllBatches')?","response":"The 'Batches' field is not supported in the standard Event Trigger for Bill Runs. A workaround is to use a naming convention for Bill Runs and use a JEXL condition on the Bill Run name, though this is difficult if Bill Runs are auto-generated from Invoice Schedules without custom names.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Bill Run Event Trigger"}
{"instruction":"How can we set a specific 'Return-Path' for emails sent via the notification framework when using an external SMTP server?","response":"You can achieve this by adding a 'Return-Path' header directly to the Email Template configuration.","category":"procedural","topic":"Email Return Path"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to retrieve a custom field value, generated by a Custom Logic function, in the response of a Create Subscription API call?","response":"No, it is likely not possible to retrieve the value in the same response. The Custom Logic update typically occurs after the Create Subscription call is completed, meaning the API response is generated before the custom field value has been populated.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Custom Logic API Response"}
{"instruction":"Is information about bounced emails available in Zuora when integrating with SendGrid, particularly to trigger downstream processes like physical letters?","response":"Yes, Zuora shows bounced email notification history (released in 2023.11.R2) and provides an alert bounce event (released in 2024.04.R1). However, if an external SMTP server (like SendGrid) is configured, the bounce information might not route back to Zuora and may only be visible in the external SMTP logs.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Email Bounces SendGrid"}

{"instruction":"How can I configure a bill run to execute on the 3rd of the month but only bill usage from the previous calendar month (1st-31st), given a 2-day upload delay?","response":"You can achieve this by removing the charge-level billing day (defaulting to the 3rd) and configuring the bill run with an Invoice Date of the 1st (e.g., 07/01) and a Target Date of the 3rd (e.g., 08/03). This configuration ensures usage is picked up through the end of the previous month while the bill run executes on the 3rd.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Bill Run Delayed Usage"}
{"instruction":"Is the Minimum Commitment marketplace app still recommended, or should we use the core feature?","response":"The Minimum Commitment marketplace app is in maintenance mode.

{"instruction":"How can I apply an existing unapplied Credit Memo to an invoice generated by a subscription cancellation order (with runBilling=true)?","response":"You cannot automatically apply an *existing* unapplied Credit Memo to a new invoice generated within the same Order call (using `runBilling=true`, `applyCredit=true`). `applyCredit=true` typically applies credit memos generated *within* that order context. You must handle the cash application (pick and apply) as a separate step after the invoice is generated.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Cancel Subscription Credit Memo"}
{"instruction":"How do I flip the symbol for credit memo amounts on an invoice template so they appear as negative values?","response":"You can use a merge field expression to multiply the amount by -1. For example: `{{#Wp_Eval}}(-1)*{{Invoice.Balance|Round(2)|Localise}}{{/Wp_Eval}}`.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Invoice Template Merge Fields"}
{"instruction":"Is there documentation available regarding Zuora's support for Hardware products?","response":"Yes, there is a guide available on the Zuora Developer Center that details hardware support and capabilities.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Hardware Support"}
{"instruction":"How can we prevent confidential production data from being exposed to external parties when refreshing a Central Sandbox?","response":"It is best practice to avoid giving external parties access to a Central Sandbox (which is a copy of Production). Instead, use a separate Developer Sandbox. Additionally, certain fields can be scrubbed during the sandbox refresh process.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Sandbox Data Scrubbing"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle Credit Memos created during a subscription suspension if the subscription is later resumed or cancelled?","response":"If a subscription is resumed, the Credit Memos (CMs) created for the suspension period are not automatically reversed. If the subscription is cancelled, writing off the CM (and the invoice) is the recommended approach to clear the balance and correctly manage revenue.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Suspend Resume Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"Can we route Canadian tax to Z-Tax and US tax to Avalara within the same tenant?","response":"Yes, this is supported out-of-the-box using the Tax Engine Mapping Formula, allowing different tax engines to be used for different jurisdictions on a single charge.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Tax Engine Routing"}
{"instruction":"How can I identify which subscriptions were processed by a Catch Up Bill Run?","response":"You can identify these subscriptions by running a query filtered by `RatePlanCharge.UpdatedDate` corresponding to the bill run time. Alternatively, create a Data Query to find subscriptions where `RatePlan.ChargedThroughDate` is populated but no related invoice exists yet.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Catch Up Bill Run Identification"}
{"instruction":"Is there a comprehensive file of US Tax Rates available for import into the Zuora Tax Engine?","response":"A file exists that includes a single sales tax rate for each state/territory, but it is not comprehensive regarding product category specific taxes or local taxes.","category":"Definitional","topic":"US Tax Rates Import"}
{"instruction":"How can I report subscription metrics like TCV and ACV in the home currency if the subscription is in a different currency?","response":"You can use Data Query to join the subscription data with the `fxcustomrate` table (assuming exchange rates are loaded). You can then calculate the converted amount by multiplying the subscription TCV/ACV by the exchange rate.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Reporting Currency Conversion"}
{"instruction":"Does migrating a tenant (e.g., NA to NA) or cloning data preserve object IDs?","response":"No, if using Global Services or API-based extraction and import, object IDs will change. History (subscription history, invoices) is also typically not reloaded.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Tenant Migration IDs"}
{"instruction":"Can a Workflow be scheduled to run just once (e.g., ad hoc for tomorrow)?","response":"There is no native 'run once' schedule option. Workarounds include scheduling it yearly and manually unscheduling it later, having the workflow update itself via API to unschedule, or using a data flag (e.g., on a custom object) to control execution.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Workflow Scheduling"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for replicating Zuora data to an external system (initial load vs. ongoing)?","response":"For initial loads, use Aqua or Data Query. For ongoing near real-time replication, use Events and Callouts. Be aware that Zuora can generate transactions faster than some systems can consume, so middleware for queueing/back-pressure is recommended. Callouts are 'best efforts' and have no SLA.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Data Replication"}
{"instruction":"How do we migrate a customer off of Invoice Settlement?","response":"This type of migration is handled by the Zuora Product team.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Invoice Settlement Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can I add new custom fields to the Configurable Summary Level GL Interface if they weren't created before the app was installed?","response":"In API mode, the interface is restricted to predefined fields. You may need to file a ticket with Product & Tech or Support to resolve this. File-based mode offers more flexibility.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"GL Interface Custom Fields"}
{"instruction":"How can I speed up a Bill Run processing 1.1M subscriptions where only a small fraction generate invoices?","response":"The bill run examines all accounts with charges where `ChargedThroughDate` is on or before the target date. To improve performance, split accounts into batches and run multiple bill runs in parallel.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Bill Run Performance"}
{"instruction":"How do I prevent invoices created by a Catch Up Bill Run (CUBR) during an O2R migration from being taxed and sent to a tax vendor?","response":"Tax calculation is usually disabled during the CUBR process and re-enabled afterward. The Open Balance migration typically handles the tax items, so the CUBR invoices themselves do not need to generate tax.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Migration Tax Handling"}
{"instruction":"How can I download or upload files larger than 5MB to Google Drive via Workflow?","response":"You can use the Google Drive API directly (e.g., `GET ...?alt=media` for download). However, Workflow has a 5MB payload limit. Operations involving files larger than 5MB will fail if the file data is loaded into the workflow payload. You must process data in streams or chunks without loading the full file into the context if possible.","category":"Technical","topic":"Workflow Google Drive Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can we drive accounting code derivation based on both tax code and state (e.g., different GL for UT vs PA)?","response":"Yes, but it likely requires a Workflow triggered on bill run or invoice generation. The workflow would extract the account state and then update the `accountingCode` on the taxation item level.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Tax Accounting by State"}
{"instruction":"Is it necessary to have separate Accounts per currency (e.g., Account USD, Account EUR) with Flexible Billing?","response":"Generally no, unless there are specific limitations with downstream integrations like CPQ X or Billing-Revenue Integration (K2) that currently require single-currency accounts.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Multi-currency Accounts"}
{"instruction":"How can I segregate GL payments by legal entity (e.g., Check-EntityA vs Check-EntityB) on a single tenant?","response":"You can create custom payment method types via the API. This allows you to define separate accounting codes for each custom payment method (e.g., 'Check-AP' and 'Check-LB'), enabling GL segregation by entity.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Custom Payment Methods for GL"}
{"instruction":"Can `PUT_WriteOffInvoice` override accounting codes?","response":"It is recommended to use the Enhanced Write Off permission, which allows for both revenue-impacting and non-revenue-impacting write-offs. This can be configured OOTB without needing to override accounting codes via API.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Invoice Write Off Accounting"}
{"instruction":"Where can I find the most up-to-date Swagger/OpenAPI file for Zuora APIs?","response":"You can download the OpenAPI 3.0 YAML file from the Zuora API Reference. Note that this file is not tenant-specific and will not include your custom fields.","category":"Definitional","topic":"API Definition File"}
{"instruction":"Why is the tax date on a Credit Memo (CM) sometimes set to the date of the original invoice item (e.g., a year ago)?","response":"Zuora maintains a `taxDate` for each item. When processing reversals or proration credits, Zuora often uses the tax date of the original invoice item to ensure consistency. This date should be mapped to the tax engine's determination date field (e.g., `TAX_DETERMINATION_DATE`).","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Tax Date Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Why can't I see the `CreditCardType` field on the PaymentMethod object in a Workflow Object Query?","response":"The `CreditCardType` field exists on the `PaymentMethod` object, not the `Payment` object. You must query the `PaymentMethod` object directly (e.g., `SELECT CreditCardType FROM PaymentMethod...`).","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Object Query Payment Method"}
{"instruction":"How can I set a subscription status to 'Pending Activation'?","response":"You can achieve this by skipping a trigger date on the Create Subscription order (e.g., setting Contract Effective Date but not Service Activation Date), provided the tenant is configured to require Service Activation.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Subscription Pending Activation"}
{"instruction":"Can we migrate the full history of subscription changes (versions) instead of just the current state?","response":"Yes, you can migrate history by creating a single order containing multiple order actions (e.g., Create, Add Product, Update Product) arranged chronologically with the correct effective dates.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Historical Subscription Migration"}
{"instruction":"Can we update accounting codes for a charge when creating a subscription via the Orders API using `chargeOverrides`?","response":"No, parameters like `accountReceivableAccountingCode` in `chargeOverrides` are only supported for Standalone Invoices, not for subscription charges via the Orders API.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Order API Accounting Codes"}
{"instruction":"How can I ensure tax is calculated on the invoice total rather than per line item to avoid rounding discrepancies (e.g., for Japan)?","response":"You can use the 'Redistribute Zuora Tax rounding differences' setting. This allows the system to sum item amounts by tax code and calculate tax on the total, rather than summing the tax calculated on each individual line.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Tax Rounding"}
{"instruction":"How do I fix 'User does not have permission to modify object definitions' errors when using Deployment Manager?","response":"The user executing the deployment on the target environment needs appropriate permissions, such as 'Platform Admin' or specific permissions to manage Custom Object definitions.

{"instruction":"Can I change the time that the Subscription Auto Renew job runs (default is 2am UTC)?","response":"Yes, you can change this in Billing Settings > Default Subscription and Order Settings > Subscription Auto Renew Job Type, by selecting 'Tenant Specified time'.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Subscription Renewal Time"}
{"instruction":"Can I format custom number fields (e.g., with commas and decimals) in the Zuora UI?","response":"No, unlike standard fields (like Unit Price), custom number fields do not currently support display formatting options in the UI.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Custom Field Formatting"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to set prices for many currencies (e.g., 27) across many charges?","response":"The best approach is to use the API to update the `ProductRatePlan`, which allows setting `ActiveCurrencies` and prices for multiple currencies (up to 50-100) in a single call.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Multi-currency Pricing Setup"}
{"instruction":"Can I set one product to be Tax Exclusive in one region and Tax Inclusive in another on the same Product Rate Plan?","response":"Yes, you can achieve this by overriding the tax inclusive/exclusive setting at the charge level when creating the Order.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Tax Inclusive Exclusive Override"}
{"instruction":"How can I bill a fixed total amount (e.g., $1000) in equal installments over a non-standard term (e.g., 13 months)?","response":"This is not supported out-of-the-box. A workaround is to create a single invoice for the total amount, leave it in draft, and then manually split it into the desired number of installment invoices.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Installment Billing"}
{"instruction":"Can I use a GitHub repository to manage Deployment Manager deployments?","response":"Yes, Deployment Manager supports integration with GitHub repositories, allowing for version control of tenant configurations.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Deployment Manager GitHub"}

{"instruction":"What is the quickest way to count records in an object (e.g., >10M) without using Data Query?","response":"For specific objects (Account, Subscription, Order, Payment, Invoice), you can use the `GET /search/object-statistics/object` API. For others, use a Data Source Export with `EXPORT ZOQL` (`POST /v1/object/export`). Data Query count queries typically time out on very large datasets.","category":"Technical","topic":"Object Record Count"}
{"instruction":"Is it safe to use the legacy Mass Order Entry tool for amendments when Orders Harmonization is enabled?","response":"No, it is not recommended or supported. The legacy tool is non-performant and does not support newer features. You should use the Data Loader with amendment import instead.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Mass Order Entry"}
{"instruction":"Can we limit free trials to one per credit card (even if emails differ)?","response":"There is no native prevention for this. While the Payment Method ID is unique per token, checking for duplicates requires custom logic (API/Workflow) and may face compliance (fingerprinting) or gateway limitations.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Free Trial Credit Card Limit"}
{"instruction":"How can I hide the 'Cancel' button in the Subscription UI to force users to use 'Create Order'?","response":"You can hide the button using Role Permissions (by removing the Cancel/Delete permission) or by using UI Property Controls if available.","category":"Procedural","topic":"UI Button Hiding"}
{"instruction":"How can I validate a customer's VAT ID before sending the account to Zuora?","response":"You can use APIs provided by tax vendors (like Sovos or Vertex) to pre-validate the ID in your upstream system (e.g., Salesforce). Zuora also allows passing values to the tax engine during invoice generation for validation.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"VAT ID Validation"}
{"instruction":"Can I set the `AccountsReceivableAccountingCode` on a Product Rate Plan Charge during creation via API?","response":"No, this field cannot be set during the initial creation. It must be updated subsequently using the Update API or Mass Updater.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"AR Accounting Code API"}
{"instruction":"How long does a Central Sandbox (CSBX) refresh typically take?","response":"The duration of a Central Sandbox refresh depends heavily on the data volume. While some estimates suggest 4-6 hours, actual times can range from 10 minutes up to several days. If the status appears stuck for an extended period, it is recommended to contact the internal cloud sandbox team (#csbx) for assistance.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"Is there a cost associated with Real-Time Reconciliation (RTR) for payment gateways?","response":"Based on implementation experience with gateways like Stripe, Adyen, and Braintree, there is typically no additional cost for Real-Time Reconciliation for customers.","category":"definitional","topic":"Real-Time Reconciliation"}
{"instruction":"How does Zuora Tax (Z-Tax) handle India taxation requiring multiple tax lines (e.g., State GST and Federal GST)?","response":"Z-Tax supports up to three tax items per invoice item. It matches the first record, but that single record can contain up to three distinct rates (e.g., CGST, SGST, IGST), allowing for the generation of multiple tax rows as required for India GST compliance.","category":"best_practice","topic":"India Taxation"}
{"instruction":"How can we sync state-level tax reporting to NetSuite when using Avalara in Zuora, given that the Jurisdiction field doesn't sync by default?","response":"Since the Jurisdiction field on the TaxationItem does not sync to NetSuite out-of-the-box, a recommended workaround is to use the `SoldTo.State` field or implement a rule in NetSuite that stamps the taxation item with the Sold-To state at the time of creation. This ensures consistent reporting even if contact information changes later.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"NetSuite Connector"}
{"instruction":"Why do Developer Tools or Data Loader report 'Ship To' fields as mandatory even when flexible billing is not enabled?","response":"This is a known cosmetic issue. The fields may be marked as mandatory in the template validation logic even if the tenant configuration (flexible billing) does not require them. These validation errors can typically be ignored or bypassed during the load process.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Developer Tools"}
{"instruction":"Where are custom FX rates stored and how can they be accessed via Data Query?","response":"Custom FX rates are stored in the `fxcustomrate` object. This object is visible in Data Query (DQ), but accessing it requires the Tenant/T9 permission to be enabled on the tenant.","category":"technical","topic":"FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"What causes the error 'The remove date should not be before the most recent invoice date' (Code: 58730030) during an amendment?","response":"This error occurs when attempting to amend or cancel a subscription with an effective date that precedes the end date of the last generated invoice. You cannot modify a subscription for a period that has already been billed. The effective date must be on or after the last invoiced date.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Amendments"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling credit memo sequencing in Spain (e.g., Telefonica)?","response":"For complex regional requirements like Spain, some enterprise customers (e.g., Telefonica) use partners to handle the generation of legal documents externally. While Zuora runs the bill runs, the actual invoice and credit memo document generation and sequencing are managed in a custom external system to ensure strict compliance with local authority rules.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Regional Compliance"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit on the number of subscription versions or amendments?","response":"Yes, there is a hard limit of 1000 versions per subscription.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Limits"}
{"instruction":"Can multiple different Invoice Schedules be created in bulk via a single API call?","response":"No, it is currently not possible to create multiple distinct invoice schedules for different items in a single bulk API call.","category":"technical","topic":"Invoice Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora bill to 6 decimal places?","response":"Zuora generally rounds billing and invoice amounts to the currency's defined precision (usually 2 decimals). While rating can happen at a higher precision (e.g., fractional cents for usage), the final invoice amount will be rounded. If the requirement is for pricing/rating precision rather than final invoice display, specific rating options ('Round and determine a price for usage records individually') can support higher precision calculations before aggregation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Decimal Precision"}
{"instruction":"What constitutes a standard chargeback workflow in Zuora?","response":"A standard chargeback process typically involves unapplying the payment and creating an external refund to reverse the transaction. Complex actions like canceling subscriptions or reversing invoices are not part of the standard chargeback event; these should be handled via dunning processes or custom workflows if required.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Chargebacks"}
{"instruction":"What is the usage rating limit per billing period, and how can it be exceeded?","response":"The legacy rater has a default limit of 200,000 usage records per rate plan charge per billing period (configurable). To process higher volumes without this limit, it is recommended to use the Advanced Consumption Rater (Unbilled Usage), which does not impose this limit. This requires enabling the 'Unbilled Usage' feature and using supported charge models.","category":"technical","topic":"Usage Rating"}
{"instruction":"Do custom fields on Product Rate Plan Charges (PRPC) automatically migrate to Subscription charges?","response":"No, custom fields on PRPC do not automatically inherit or copy to Subscription charges during migration. You must explicitly map and populate `Charge.CustomField__c` in your migration templates (supported in Developer Tools Orders dictionary) to ensure these values carry over.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Why are there multiple export APIs (DQ, AQuA, DSE) and which should be used?","response":"The variety of export APIs is historical. Data Query (DQ) is powerful and supports complex joins but is more complex to use. Data Source Export (DSE) and AQuA are better suited for simple bulk exports. There are known parity issues where some objects exist in DQ but not AQuA/DSE. A project is underway to unify these sources, but for now, choice depends on the need for joins (use DQ) vs. bulk simplicity (use DSE/AQuA).","category":"comparison","topic":"Export APIs"}
{"instruction":"How can I amend a subscription charge that is part of an executed Invoice Schedule?","response":"You cannot update the quantity or amount of a charge once it is part of an active/executed Invoice Schedule. A workaround is to remove the charge and create a new one, though the new charge would need to be assigned to a new Invoice Schedule.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Why is the 'Deploy' button missing for the Vertex Tax Connector in the Marketplace?","response":"This is often a provisioning issue where the feature has not been fully enabled for the tenant. A support ticket is required to have the provisioning team rectify the configuration.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Marketplace Apps"}
{"instruction":"Can I add a new feature to an existing subscription without creating an order?","response":"No, adding a feature or product to an existing subscription must be done through an Order (Amendment).","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"What if an external system (e.g., SAP) cannot store the long Zuora Invoice ID (GUID) for payments?","response":"It is common for external systems to have character limits. Best practice is to create a custom field in the external system to store the Zuora GUID, or to store both the Invoice Number (shorter) and the GUID if possible, to ensure reliable matching for external payments.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integrations"}
{"instruction":"What are the risks of using Billing Schedules for Milestone Billing?","response":"Billing Schedules must be created via a separate call after the order. A significant limitation is that you cannot update the quantity or amount of an item once it is in a Billing Schedule (though you can remove it). Additionally, service periods on the generated invoices may appear unusual depending on the schedule dates.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing Schedules"}
{"instruction":"How far back can Workflow logs be viewed in Production?","response":"By default, retention may be shorter, but in Production, the cleanup policy can be configured to retain workflow run history for up to 90 days via Workflow settings.","category":"technical","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"Can a subscription be suspended without generating a credit memo?","response":"Yes, if the suspension is made effective as of the last billed-through date, no credit memo will be generated for the already billed period.","category":"procedural","topic":"Suspensions"}
{"instruction":"Does the NetSuite Connector support syncing tax data for Credit and Debit Memos?","response":"Yes, this is supported via the 'Inline Taxation for Invoices and Credit Memos' functionality. Ensure this feature is enabled and configured in the connector settings.","category":"technical","topic":"NetSuite Connector"}
{"instruction":"Can Flexible Billing attributes (custom fields on Subscriptions) be used in Tax Code formulas?","response":"No, this is currently a functional gap. Tax formulas generally only support standard fields and custom fields from the Account and SoldToContact objects. Subscription-level custom fields cannot be directly used to drive tax logic.","category":"limitation","topic":"Flexible Billing"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to report on orders that were rolled back due to failed payments?","response":"No, rolled-back transactions are not persisted in Zuora's database and thus are not available for reporting via standard data sources. Best practice is to log these attempts externally or to create cancellation orders to track the activity within Zuora.","category":"limitation","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora have a Terraform provider?","response":"There is no official Terraform provider yet, but an AOC (AOC-02253) exists for this request.","category":"technical","topic":"Terraform"}
{"instruction":"How can I resolve a OneID login loop where the page redirects repeatedly?","response":"This can happen when a password reset is required but the redirect fails due to browser caching. A known workaround is to open a different browser (or incognito window), log in to trigger the password reset flow, update the password, and then return to the original browser to log in.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"OneID"}
{"instruction":"How can we address proration rounding errors where customers lose cents?","response":"This is often 'working as designed' due to rounding precision logic. Options are limited: Engineering may address rounding precision in the long term, but immediate workarounds are difficult. Some customers audit invoices and apply small one-time charges to correct differences, though this is manual.","category":"limitation","topic":"Rounding"}
{"instruction":"Why does usage not appear on an invoice if the bill run target date is the last day of the month?","response":"This depends on the 'Billing Day' setting of the usage rate plan charge. If set to '1st of the month', the usage will only be picked up by a bill run dated the 1st of the next month. If set to 'End of Month', it should appear on a bill run targeting the last day of the month.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Billing"}
{"instruction":"Can multiple CPQ instances feed into a single Zuora Billing tenant without Multi-Entity?","response":"Yes, but it requires careful management of the 360 Sync. You will likely need a custom sync process to ensure that account and subscription data from Zuora is correctly routed back to the appropriate Salesforce instance.","category":"best_practice","topic":"CPQ Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can I report on Functional Currency without Multi-Org?","response":"Without Multi-Org, Zuora reports in the Home Currency. A workaround is to use a Workflow to export data and apply currency conversion logic during the export process, or to perform the conversion in an external data warehouse.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Do child accounts in a hierarchy sync to Salesforce automatically?","response":"Child accounts generally will not sync to Salesforce unless they have a CRM ID populated. If they were not created via CPQ, you may need to manually populate the CRM ID to trigger the sync.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora support deployment on Private Clouds?","response":"No, Zuora does not support private cloud deployments.","category":"definitional","topic":"Deployment"}
{"instruction":"When is a Custom Logic function triggered (Creation vs Update)?","response":"The UI for selecting specific trigger events (Create vs Update) has been removed. You must now include logic within the function code itself to determine when to execute (e.g., checking if a specific field is empty to detect a 'create' scenario).","category":"technical","topic":"Custom Logic"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora show bounced email notifications when using an external SMTP server (e.g., SendGrid)?","response":"If using an external SMTP server, bounce notifications typically do not route back to Zuora. You must check the logs of the external SMTP provider (e.g., SendGrid) to view bounce information.","category":"technical","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"How can I restrict specific currencies to specific Orgs in a Multi-Org environment if the Product Catalog is shared?","response":"Since the Product Catalog is shared across Orgs, you can use Custom Logic on the Subscription object to validate the currency at the time of creation. The logic can block subscription creation if the currency does not match the allowed list for the user's current Org.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"How can we combine the usage of two products (e.g., Product X and Product Y) for overage purposes where a customer commits to a total unit count across both?","response":"To achieve this, the customer would need to pay upfront. You can then link both usage Units of Measure (UOMs) to the same drawdown or prepaid UOM.","category":"procedural","topic":"Usage Billing"}
{"instruction":"In CPQX, is there a setting to automatically invoke a bill run when an order is submitted from Salesforce, similar to the runbilling = true option in the Order API?","response":"Yes, on the quote before sending it to Zuora, there is a check/flag labeled \"Generate Invoice\" that triggers this behavior.","category":"procedural","topic":"CPQX"}
{"instruction":"Can a payment run be configured to use a specific credit card payment method for an account that has wire transfer set as the default, specifically to ensure surcharges are applied?","response":"Yes, you can use the \"Custom Payment Run\" functionality via the POST PaymentRun API. In the data field of the payload, you can specify the paymentMethodId for each specific accountId. Note that the targetDate in the payload must be set beyond the Due Date of the invoice (not the created date) for the payment to be picked up. While creating a payment directly (outside a run) allows picking a method, using the Payment Run API is necessary if you need surcharges to apply.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Runs"}
{"instruction":"Is there a specific setting required to submit a quote for Order Line Items (OLI) only in CPQX?","response":"No specific setting is required; submitting a quote with only OLI is supported out-of-the-box and should work without issues. If submitting fails, check for specific errors rather than configuration settings.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"CPQX"}
{"instruction":"At what time of day does the \"Upcoming Renewal\" notification event trigger? Does it respect the tenant's timezone?","response":"The default time for auto-renewals (and associated upcoming renewal events) is typically 01:00 (1 AM) for the scheduler, irrespective of the specific data center or tenant timezone.","category":"definitional","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Why don't payments and refunds inherit the numbering sequence set assigned at the subscription level when using Flexible Billing, unlike billing documents?","response":"This is a known inconsistency. Payments are generally linked to the Account, not the Subscription (unless Payment Profiles are used). A single payment or payment run can cover multiple invoices from different subscriptions (which might have different sequence sets), making a 1:1 link impossible. The sequence set configuration includes prefixes for payments/refunds, which causes confusion when Flexible Billing attributes are used at the sub level.","category":"definitional","topic":"Flexible Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can we send a Hosted Payment Method (HPM) link to a specific customer to capture their payment method after a contract/subscription is created, specifically for sales-led CPQX customers who don't log in?","response":"This requires a custom solution involving Salesforce development. The recommended flow is: (1) CPQX/Salesforce generates a unique link for the customer account that redirects to a client-hosted page embedding Zuora's HPM. (2) Store this link in a custom field on the Zuora Account via API. (3) Trigger a notification from Zuora containing this link. (4) The customer clicks the link, enters details on the HPM, and the Payment Method is saved to the Zuora account.","category":"best_practice","topic":"HPM Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement a \"Price Lock\" or pre-negotiated price for future purchases that a customer isn't buying yet but wants on the order form for later use?","response":"There is no out-of-the-box \"Contract Pricing\" feature currently available to handle this. A potential workaround is using a sidebar component or custom UI to manage these prices, but challenges arise regarding versioning and handling price changes/uplifts during the contract term.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Pricing Strategy"}
{"instruction":"Can Order Line Items (OLIs) be billed to a different invoice owner, similar to how subscriptions can have a specific invoice owner?","response":"Yes, there is an option for \"Invoice Owner Transfer\" during OLI creation that allows specifying a different owner for billing.","category":"procedural","topic":"Order Line Items"}
{"instruction":"How can we display a dollar amount as a percentage (e.g., usage percentage) in HTML invoice templates?","response":"You can use JavaScript within the HTML template. Insert a placeholder div and a script that converts the number: return (num / 100).toLocaleString(undefined, { style: 'percent' }).","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"Can the \"Single-Subscription Version\" feature be enabled for a tenant that already has existing transaction data or versioned subscriptions?","response":"No, the Single-Subscription Version feature is generally intended for new, clean tenants. It cannot be enabled if the tenant already has transaction data or existing subscriptions.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"Why does an advanced bill run filter scan all accounts even when a specific subscription filter is provided?","response":"The system filter logic proceeds hierarchically from Account -> Subscription -> Charge. If no Account Filter is specified, the system picks up *all* accounts with charges to be billed before checking the Subscription filter. To optimize, you must start with an Account filter.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Bill Runs"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to add or remove a specific charge from a subscription without removing the entire rate plan?","response":"Adding a specific charge to an existing rate plan is supported via the \"charge subset\" feature (adding optional charges) using the Update Product Order Action via API. However, removing a specific charge from a rate plan (without removing the plan) is currently a limitation and is not supported.","category":"procedural","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to generate both a PDF invoice and a PEPPOL XML file for the same billing document within Zuora?","response":"Yes, PDF and XML generation are independent processes, so you can generate both to satisfy requirements for emailing a PDF and delivering an XML to the PEPPOL network.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"What is the limit on the number of versions a subscription can have, and what are the implications of high version counts?","response":"The limit is typically 1001 versions (1000 amendments). High version counts can lead to performance degradation. For use cases requiring frequent updates (e.g., every bill cycle), consider using the \"Single-Subscription Version\" feature if it is a new tenant.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"When is it recommended to use Dynamic Usage Charges over standard Subscriptions in Zuora?","response":"Use Subscriptions for ongoing relationships with predictable billing cycles, customer lifecycle management (upgrades/renewals), and recurring fees. Use Dynamic Usage Charges for usage-based or pay-as-you-go models where there is no fixed recurring fee, for stand-alone billing tied to an account without a product subscription, or for sporadic one-off charges.","category":"comparison","topic":"Usage Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can a workflow be triggered immediately after a successful Foreign Exchange (FX) Rates import?","response":"The \"Import Processed\" event does not support callouts. The recommended approach is to have the customer add a step to their integration to explicitly trigger the Zuora Workflow via API immediately after the FX import is complete. Alternatively, use an SFTP drop triggering a workflow if supported.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"Is the Invoice Item Adjustments (IIA) feature going End of Support (EOS) or being discontinued in 2026?","response":"No, IIA is not being discontinued. While documentation may confusingly reference \"Maintenance Mode\" or EOS, the plan to discontinue it was reverted. Customers can continue to use it, though it will not receive new features.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can we hide sensitive information like credit card details from specific users (e.g., customer service agents) while allowing them to see subscriptions and invoices?","response":"Credit card numbers are already masked by default. For further data protection, Zuora Protect (a paid feature in Early Access) can be used to enable platform encryption and manage data visibility.","category":"procedural","topic":"Security"}
{"instruction":"Can a Custom Object have a relationship field linking to a custom field on a standard object (like a Product Rate Plan Charge)?","response":"No. Custom Object relationship fields can only map to the ID of a standard object (e.g., PRPC.Id), not to custom fields on that object. Additionally, relationships are designed as Many-to-One; you cannot create a relationship linking to a custom field.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom Objects"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to query for unbilled usage charges to identify missed billing or anticipated billing?","response":"You should query the RatingResult table where status = 'Rated'.","category":"procedural","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to connect two separate Salesforce instances (one using CPQ/360, one using API) to a single Zuora tenant?","response":"Yes, it is possible but complex. It typically involves custom API integrations (GET/POST) to sync data, often using the Orders API to interface the non-CPQ Salesforce instance with Zuora.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can a single line item on a customer invoice be split into multiple accounting codes (e.g., 85% to Account A, 15% to Account B) on the backend?","response":"Zuora requires that each Charge maps to a specific GL account. To achieve the split, you must configure the Rate Plan with multiple separate charges (e.g., Charge 1 for 85%, Charge 2 for 15%) each mapped to the respective Chart of Accounts. To present this as a \"single line\" to the customer, you would need to group these charges on the Invoice PDF template logic.","category":"procedural","topic":"Accounting Integration"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora support the new tokenization framework for Credit Cards with Adyen, or is it legacy?","response":"Currently, Zuora's integration with Adyen uses the legacy tokenization model for Credit Cards (storing TokenId and SecondTokenId on the PaymentMethod object), whereas ACH/SEPA use the new framework. Enabling \"Submit card payments with RecurringDetailReference\" may cause issues if the gateway configuration does not match the token/PAN data being passed.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"How can we link failed payment attempts to invoices using Data Query?","response":"You can link them by joining Invoice, PaymentApplication, and Payment. Use the query: SELECT i.InvoiceNumber, i.Amount, ARRAY_AGG(p.effectivedate ORDER BY p.effectivedate) AS Failed_Payment_Attempts FROM Invoice i LEFT JOIN PaymentApplication pa ON pa.invoiceid = i.id JOIN Payment p ON p.id = pa.paymentid AND p.status = 'Error' AND p.type = 'Electronic' GROUP BY 1,2.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Query"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora store the JSON request bodies for REST API callouts for debugging purposes?","response":"No, Zuora generally does not store request bodies for API calls due to security and scalability reasons.","category":"definitional","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommendation regarding using event-based notifications for large-scale data integrations between Billing and other systems?","response":"Zuora does not recommend using event-based notifications for large-scale data integrations. Instead, use scheduled, pull-based integrations via AQUA or Data Query. These offer better reliability, error handling, and performance at scale.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can Avalara be configured to use the \"Ship To\" address at the Subscription level instead of the Account \"Sold To\"?","response":"Yes, this happens automatically if you turn off Flexible Billing Attributes (FBA). If a Ship To is present, the connector uses it; otherwise, it defaults to Sold To.","category":"procedural","topic":"Taxes"}
{"instruction":"How can we extract a list of all custom fields to compare between environments?","response":"You can use the Settings API: GET /settings/custom-fields/zuora.

{"instruction":"Can we access the Journal Entry transaction detail tables (e.g., JournalEntryDetailInvoiceItem) via Data Query?","response":"No, these tables are exposed in Data Source exports but not in Data Query. To analyze this data via query, you must either export via Data Source and load into an external DB/Custom Object, or write queries against the source transactional objects (InvoiceItem, Payment, etc.) which contain journalentryid fields.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Finance"}
{"instruction":"Why does creating a custom event on the RatePlanCharge object fail when comparing a field against a constant/static value?","response":"There is a documented limitation: \"When creating custom events, you cannot match fields of the RatePlanCharge object against constant values for the condition field.\"","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Custom Events"}
{"instruction":"How can we set up a Workflow callout to NetSuite (NetSuiteTBA) for sending summary journals?","response":"You can configure the callout using global parameters for credentials. There is an existing workflow template \"Netsuite Integration\" available that demonstrates this setup.","category":"procedural","topic":"NetSuite Integration"}
{"instruction":"When implementing a GoCardless one-time payment flow, why might we get an \"Insufficient Dynamic params error: missing accountId\" error during the RSA signature generation?","response":"This often happens because the Zuora Account must exist before the Payment Method can be created or signed for in certain flows. If the account ID is not passed or created prior to the RSA signature call, the gateway cannot link the mandate.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"How can we display the 3-character currency code (e.g., \"GBP\") next to an amount in an HTML invoice template?","response":"You can use the merge field {{Account.Currency}} to display the currency code.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement an \"Even Billing\" or \"Enterprise Agreement\" model where a Parent pays a fixed monthly amount (e.g., $1M) and Child accounts burn down this balance?","response":"This is complex. Suggestions include: (1) Prepaid Drawdown (works best for usage, limits rev rec visibility). (2) Prepaid Cash with Drawdown (pays for child subs but doesn't invoice parent easily). (3) Workflow creating Credit Memos from the parent's payment to apply to child invoices (requires \"Payment Cross Accounts\" feature).","category":"best_practice","topic":"Enterprise Billing"}
{"instruction":"If a tenant has Invoice Settlement (IS) enabled, is it normal to still see Invoice Settlement Harmonization (ISH) objects (like InvoiceItemAdjustment)?","response":"Yes, if the tenant was migrated from ISH to IS, historical ISH objects may still be visible. However, legacy objects like InvoiceAdjustment should be deprecated/hidden.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"Why does the 3DS prompt show an amount of 0 (e.g., £0) instead of the actual transaction amount when using Stripe v2?","response":"This is a known behavior of the Stripe v2 integration. The amount configured or specified for validation in the payment form web session is ignored for the 3DS challenge display in some flows, often defaulting to an authorization check of 0.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"If a Bill Run fails to post invoices (leaving them in DRAFT) due to a tax engine timeout, is there an automatic retry mechanism?","response":"There is no automatic retry to \"post\" draft invoices that failed during a bill run. The invoices must be posted manually or picked up by a subsequent bill run (if configured).","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Bill Runs"}
{"instruction":"Can we bill a customer upfront for a subscription but split the total amount into two invoices with different payment terms (e.g., $5k Due Upon Receipt, $15k Net 90)?","response":"Payment terms are set at the Invoice level. To achieve this, you must generate two separate invoices. This can be done by setting the term on the account, generating Invoice 1, then changing the term, and generating Invoice 2.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"Is there a versioned URL for Payment Form hosted scripts (like zuora.js) to support SRI integrity hashing without breaking when Zuora updates the script?","response":"No, there is currently no interim solution or versioned URL for Payment Forms scripts. A product enhancement is in development to address this.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Forms"}
{"instruction":"Is CSS styling customization supported for Zuora Payment Forms?","response":"No, CSS customization is not supported for Payment Forms, and product teams have indicated no immediate plans to enable it.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Forms"}
{"instruction":"Are there reference implementations or examples for integrating Zuora with external monitoring systems like Splunk or Dynatrace?","response":"There are no pre-baked OOTB integrations. Customers typically build this using a combination of the Audit Trail and System Health APIs.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are some use cases for Order Line Items (OLIs) and has anyone successfully implemented them for hardware or digital fulfillment?","response":"Order Line Items (OLIs) are used for non-subscription items. A cited use case involves Reuters News & Media using OLIs for licensing real-time image feeds (Single Asset Licensing). Other customers, such as Xylem and game publishers, considered OLIs for hardware or digital key fulfillment but often encountered complexity in setup or external requirements that prevented implementation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Order Line Items (OLI)"}
{"instruction":"How can I report on ACH payments or Payment Methods specifically in Grafana?","response":"You can use the Telemetry Metrics dashboards. For payments (filtering by method type ACH), use the payment dashboard URL (e.g., `.../goto/NL-QHaqHk?orgId=1`). For a breakdown of payment methods, use the Payment Method Dashboard (e.g., `.../d/HU6fRtdVz/payment-method-dashboard?orgId=1`).","category":"procedural","topic":"Reporting / Grafana"}
{"instruction":"Why would a customer see a high volume of Credit Memos, sometimes exceeding Invoice values in a month, when using Invoice Settlement?","response":"This can occur due to specific use cases like high-value cancellations mid-month. For example, if a customer cancels a high-value plan ($500) and keeps a low-value plan ($100), the system generates a large proration credit. Depending on the 'Credit Memo Generation Rule' in billing settings, these negative amounts may generate separate Credit Memos rather than netting off against the invoice, potentially causing Credit Memo volumes to exceed Invoice volumes for that period.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"#zuora_sa"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle the 'limbo' window between subscription expiration at midnight and the auto-renewal job execution (e.g., 2 AM), where customers might accidentally re-subscribe as new?","response":"The recommended approach is to implement application-side logic to block purchase capabilities for active or renewing subscribers during this window. Alternatively, move the auto-renewal job execution to midnight to close the gap. While running renewal and scheduled order jobs (for price uplifts) in parallel is possible, sequential execution is generally safer to avoid processing conflicts. Adding warning text to renewal emails about processing delays is also suggested.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Auto-Renewal"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora have pre-built connectors for procurement platforms like Coupa or Ariba to ingest Purchase Orders?","response":"No, there are currently no pre-built connectors for Coupa or Ariba. Integration typically requires custom configuration involving field matching and CSV uploads. Product teams are tracking this capability for future inclusion in Zuora Collections (Growfin).","category":"comparison","topic":"Integrations / Procurement"}
{"instruction":"Can pop-up blockers interfere with 3DS2 verification flows?","response":"Yes, if the 3D Secure (3DS) challenge is presented in a pop-up window rather than an iframe, aggressive ad blockers can block the verification window, preventing successful payment processing.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payments / 3DS2"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement a percentage uplift charge (e.g., 20% service fee) on a total invoice?","response":"Currently, the primary options are using a negative discount or calculating an absolute amount externally. A 'Calculated Charge Model' feature is planned for release (Early Access in Q4). Workarounds include generating a draft invoice to calculate the fee, then adding it as a usage/OLI charge, or using a frontend/CPQ process to calculate the fixed amount before sending the order to Zuora.","category":"procedural","topic":"Charge Models"}
{"instruction":"What is a recommended strategy for grouping countries into Vertex tax templates for international expansion?","response":"A pragmatic approach involves grouping by tax regime. For example: Template 1 for Destination-based tax (US, Canada), Template 2 for VAT/GST countries (Australia, UK, Germany, etc.), and Template 3 for unique regimes like Brazil. However, consider keeping EU countries separate or using Zuora Tax if simpler. If using Vertex for EU, verify it supports 'Reverse Charge' for B2B tax-free selling, which Zuora's native tax solution does not handle OOTB. The selling entity location is critical for configuration.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Tax / Vertex"}
{"instruction":"Is there an available connector for Microsoft Dynamics 365?","response":"Yes, Zuora offers a Revenue Bi-Directional Connector for Microsoft Dynamics 365.","category":"definitional","topic":"Connectors / Microsoft Dynamics"}
{"instruction":"How can I resolve tax rounding discrepancies when creating multiple manual credit memos against a single invoice?","response":"Discrepancies occur because tax is calculated individually on each Credit Memo. To resolve, ensure 'Tax Auto Calculation' is enabled for all Credit Memos. You may need to use 'Tax Inclusive' mode for the final credit memo or manually adjust amounts to ensure the cumulative tax matches the original invoice exactly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Taxation / Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora support detailed transaction-level integration to Workday (e.g., invoice item level) instead of just Journal Entries?","response":"Yes, some customers (e.g., Veradigm) have implemented detailed transaction-level integrations to Workday, going beyond simple Journal Entry summaries.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integrations / Workday"}
{"instruction":"How can we update existing Foreign Exchange (FX) rates in Zuora?","response":"You cannot update existing FX rate records directly via Mass Updater (it will error on duplicates). The standard solution is to delete the existing rates and re-upload the corrected ones. Support can assist in deleting rates for a specific period if needed.","category":"procedural","topic":"FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"Why would a user with correct permissions be unable to see all API options in Developer Tools?","response":"This is often a provisioning issue where the tenant or user is not correctly entitled to the Developer Tools feature. Checking with the Provisioning team is recommended.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Developer Tools"}
{"instruction":"Does spacing matter in Workflow batch parameters (e.g., '6, 21' vs '6,21')?","response":"Yes, spacing matters. It is recommended to use comma-separated values without spaces (e.g., '6,21') to ensure the parameters are read correctly.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"What are the impacts of enabling Invoice Item Settlement on the data model and reporting?","response":"Enabling Invoice Item Settlement changes the underlying data model. Journal Runs will use new transaction types (`Electronic Payment Application Item` vs `Electronic Payment Application`), significantly increasing Journal Entry volume. The `PaymentApplication.JournalEntryId` field stops being populated, replaced by `PaymentApplicationItem.JournalEntryId`, which breaks existing AQuA queries filtering by Journal Run on the old object.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Item Settlement"}
{"instruction":"Can a workflow trigger be filtered to run only if an invoice contains a specific charge?","response":"No, you cannot filter by specific charge at the Workflow Trigger level. You must trigger the workflow on the Invoice object and then add a condition task as the first step to check the invoice items and stop execution if the specific charge is not found.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement a 'Maximum Charge' cap (e.g., $60k annual limit) for a customer?","response":"Zuora does not have a native 'Cap' feature similar to Minimum Commit. This requires a custom solution, often involving Commitments and Workflows to track usage and discount/zero-out charges once the cap is hit. Some customers have implemented this via heavy customization.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing Logic"}
{"instruction":"Can Product & Engineering perform a complete 'factory reset' or data wipe of a Sandbox?","response":"There is an official Workflow available to clean up transactional data (accounts, subs), but it does not reset reference data like the Product Catalog or settings. A true 'fresh start' often requires this workflow followed by manual cleanup steps.","category":"procedural","topic":"Sandbox Management"}
{"instruction":"How can I override the accounting code for tax items on a Credit Memo?","response":"The system often recalculates tax and reverts accounting codes to default upon posting a Credit Memo. To handle write-offs with specific accounting codes, use the 'Enhanced Write Off' process which allows specifying accounting codes during the write-off action, rather than manually creating a Credit Memo.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Credit Memos / Accounting Codes"}
{"instruction":"Is there a direct relationship or ID link between Zuora Contacts and Salesforce Contacts?","response":"There is no direct link between the core Salesforce `Contact` object and Zuora Contacts. The Zuora 360 Sync package includes a `Zuora__ZContact__c` object, but it is not the standard Contact object. CPQ logic matches contacts based on algorithms (names, etc.) rather than strict ID matching.","category":"definitional","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"How do I cancel a draft invoice using the API or Workflow?","response":"You can use the old CRUD API to update the invoice status to 'Cancelled', or use the undocumented endpoint `PUT /v1/invoices/{invoiceKey}/cancel`. The v2 API is not supported for this action within Workflow.","category":"procedural","topic":"API / Invoices"}
{"instruction":"Why do Payment Links fail with the 'Test Gateway' error when using an Adyen test gateway?","response":"This error can occur if the 'Payment Form' feature is not enabled for the Payment Link. Ensure you are using the Payment Form version of the feature, as legacy versions have stricter limitations regarding test gateways.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Links"}
{"instruction":"How can I rename report columns to remove the 'Object Name:' prefix for client exports?","response":"The most effective method is to use a Workflow with a 'CSV Create' task to rename the headers during file generation. Native reporting always includes the object prefix (or alias), even when using Data Query.","category":"procedural","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Can a single Salesforce product support multiple billing frequencies (e.g., Monthly and Annual) when syncing to Zuora?","response":"Yes, this can be achieved by setting the Zuora Product Catalog charge 'List Price Base' to 'Per Month' instead of 'Per Billing Period'. This allows the connector to calculate the correct price regardless of the billing frequency selected on the Salesforce Quote.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Salesforce CPQ"}
{"instruction":"How do I resolve 'lock competition' errors when applying payments immediately after order creation via API?","response":"This error (`v1/payments/.../apply` failed) occurs due to concurrency if the invoice or payment is still being processed/locked by the creation call. Implementing a retry logic (e.g., 3 retries spaced 3 seconds apart) for the apply call is a proven solution.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"API / Payments"}
{"instruction":"Where is the 'Change Reason' field from the Orders UI stored?","response":"It is stored in `OrderAction.ChangeReason`. It is a free-form field that copies to `Subscription.cancelReason` if the action is a cancellation. It is not a custom field on the Subscription object.","category":"definitional","topic":"Orders / Data Model"}
{"instruction":"How can I terminate a Rate Plan Charge without performing a full removal action?","response":"If the subscription or order is in Draft status, you can update the Rate Plan Charge's `EndDateCondition` directly via the API. For active subscriptions, a standard Rate Plan Update/Remove order action is required.","category":"procedural","topic":"Orders"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora merge multiple invoice PDFs into a single file for dunning?","response":"No, Zuora does not natively merge PDF files. You would need to use a Workflow with an external service (like AWS Lambda) to merge them. Alternatively, you can use the 'Account Summary Statement' feature to generate a single document summarizing the invoices, but this is a new document, not a merge of existing PDFs.","category":"capability","topic":"Invoices / PDF"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended process for handling chargebacks where the merchant wins the dispute?","response":"The standard flow starts with Gateway Reconciliation creating an External Refund. If the dispute is won, the best practice is to create a new External Payment and apply it to the invoice. Simply undoing the refund is often not supported by downstream ERP integrations.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payments / Chargebacks"}
{"instruction":"Is customer data encrypted at rest in Zuora Billing?","response":"Yes, customer data is encrypted at rest. Credit card data is encrypted via HSMs, and data in AWS is encrypted via AWS KMS, compliant with SOC 1 Type 2 standards.","category":"security","topic":"Security"}
{"instruction":"How can I trigger a workflow when an agent manually emails an invoice from the UI?","response":"The native 'Email' button does not trigger a workflow event. You should disable the native button permissions and replace it with a custom UI button that invokes a Workflow to send the email and perform any additional required logic.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow / UI"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora support ZUGFeRD or xInvoice e-invoicing formats?","response":"Zuora does not natively support ZUGFeRD. It supports **Peppol BIS Billing 3.0**, which is a compliant format in Germany and other regions. ZUGFeRD is a distinct format.","category":"capability","topic":"E-Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"How can I update Product Rate Plan Charge pricing for multiple currencies using Data Loader?","response":"The standard 'Update Product Rate Plan Charge' template often fails for multi-currency updates. The recommended approach is to use the `Product Rate Plan Charge Tier` object. First, query `ProductRatePlanChargeTier` to get Tier IDs and Currencies, then use Data Loader to update the `Price` field on the `Product Rate Plan Charge Tier` object using those IDs.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Loader / Pricing"}
{"instruction":"How can I prevent multiple instances of a workflow from running concurrently for the same account?","response":"You can add a custom logic step (e.g., a query loop) at the beginning of the workflow to check if another instance is currently running for the same entity ID and block or delay execution until it clears.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"What are the risks of changing the API Name of an existing Custom Field?","response":"Changing the API Name will break any existing integrations, Data Query scripts, or exports that reference that field. It is highly risky. The recommended best practice is to create a new custom field with the desired name instead.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Fields"}
{"instruction":"What happens to SEPA mandates if we migrate from GoCardless to Stripe?","response":"Since SEPA mandates are tokenized by the gateway, you cannot simply switch the gateway in Zuora. You must migrate the mandate data (tokens) between the gateways (GoCardless to Stripe) and then recreate the Payment Methods in Zuora to reference the new Stripe customer/payment tokens.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payments / Migration"}
{"instruction":"Why doesn't the Flexible Billing Attribute 'Sold To' contact appear on the Invoice header?","response":"This is expected behavior. When Flexible Billing Attributes are used, the subscription-level Sold To contact is stamped on the **Invoice Items**, not the Invoice Header. The Invoice Header retains the Invoice Owner's default contact.","category":"definitional","topic":"Flexible Billing"}
{"instruction":"Is SCIM support available for Zuora OneID?","response":"Yes, SCIM v2 API is available for provisioning OneID. Additional integration for syncing role assignments from Entra ID is also in development.","category":"capability","topic":"SSO / OneID"}
{"instruction":"Why are there field inconsistencies between v1 APIs and Object Query (e.g., missing productSku)?","response":"These inconsistencies are due to the different ages and underlying technologies of the APIs (v1 is older, Object Query is newer). While there is no plan for a global refactor to align them, specific missing fields in Object Query can often be added by raising a support request (L3 ticket).","category":"definitional","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"How can I update multi-attribute pricing mid-term for a subscription?","response":"To update attributes that drive pricing formulas mid-term, you must perform an order action to remove the existing Rate Plan and add a new Rate Plan with the updated attributes.","category":"procedural","topic":"Pricing"}
{"instruction":"How do I retrieve `orderactionrateplan` charges in Data Query?","response":"There is no direct `OrderActionRatePlanCharge` object. You must join/drill down from `OrderActionRatePlan` to `RatePlan`, and then to `RatePlanCharge` to access the charge details.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Query"}
{"instruction":"I'm receiving a \"RenewalSetting is required\" error when calling the v1/orders API, even though the field is present in my request body. What could be the cause?","response":"This error message can be misleading. In past cases, this specific error has occurred when the `Idempotency-Key` parameter was included in the header. Try removing the `Idempotency-Key` from the header to see if the call succeeds.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"v1/orders API Error"}
{"instruction":"I am unable to access the Users section under Administration in my personal sandbox. How can I retrieve my OAuth credentials if I can't navigate to the user page?","response":"If the UI is unresponsive or inaccessible, you can try accessing the user page directly via a URL workaround. Use the following format: `https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/UserLogin.do?method=view&id=INSERT_ID_HERE`, replacing `INSERT_ID_HERE` with your user ID. Note that the API Sandbox UI can be very slow.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox User Access"}
{"instruction":"When are OANDA FX rates populated in Zuora Billing, and what is the lookback period?","response":"Zuora Billing usually pulls OANDA rates once a day. OANDA publishes one FX rate per currency pair per day, ending at 22:00 UTC on the previous day. The lookback period is typically 1 or 2 days in the past.","category":"Definitional","topic":"OANDA Rates"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to automate Snowflake key rotation via a scheduled workflow that creates a ticket? Does Zuora Support accept ticket creation via email?","response":"Yes, Zuora Support confirmed that tickets can be raised by sending an email to the support email address. You can configure a workflow to send this email automatically for key rotation requests.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Snowflake Key Rotation"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for setting up milestone-based billing for professional services?","response":"The recommended approach is to use the \"Billing Schedule\" feature. While it can be manual, it is built specifically to handle milestone billing scenarios where invoices are generated after certain milestones are hit.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Milestone Billing"}
{"instruction":"Can we use the Split Invoice feature to invoice multiple parties (e.g., Company B and C) for a contract held by Company A?","response":"No, Zuora does not natively support multi-party agreements where a single contract is split-invoiced to different legal entities directly. The contract is between Zuora and Party A. The Split Invoice feature is intended for different use cases. The standard recommendation is to invoice Party A, who is then responsible for invoicing Parties B and C. Creating standalone invoices for B and C and a credit memo for A is not a recommended workaround.","category":"Comparison","topic":"Split Invoicing Multi-Party"}
{"instruction":"I am getting a \"Data exceeds the size limit of 5 MB\" error in a Workflow Invoice Data Export task. Can this limit be increased?","response":"The 5 MB limit on workflow tasks is generally not waived. To resolve this, you need to narrow down your Data Query (DQ) to return fewer records or split the processing into smaller batches.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Workflow Size Limit"}
{"instruction":"What is the strategy and expected duration for an Invoice Settlement (IS) migration with large data volumes?","response":"Migrations for large volumes (e.g., millions of subscriptions) can take a significant amount of time, potentially requiring a weekend blackout period. However, a newer approach allows for background \"silent\" payment migration to occur before the full IS migration, which minimizes downtime. Engineering can also filter by payment effective date to migrate selective history.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Invoice Settlement Migration"}
{"instruction":"Why would usage records be left as separate unrated records on an account despite having a valid Subscription Number and Charge Number?","response":"This often happens if the dates or Unit of Measure (UOM) on the usage records do not align with the rate plan charge, or if the usage falls into periods that have already been rated/billed.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Records Not Rating"}
{"instruction":"How do I setup a subscription so the first invoice is prorated until the end of the year, for a yearly subscription starting on September 1st?","response":"Create the subscription with a start date of January 1st, and then immediately update the term start date to September 1st (01/09). Ensure charges are aligned to the subscription start. This aligns the billing periods such that the first invoice covers Sept-Dec.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Prorated First Invoice"}
{"instruction":"Can users modify subscriptions or limits in a \"read-only\" tenant?","response":"Yes. A \"read-only\" tenant is a commercial concept indicating no purchased volume (utilization should stay at 0), but it is not a technical restriction. Users still have full technical capabilities to modify data via UI or API.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Read-Only Tenant"}
{"instruction":"Is it an issue if a US-based entity (transacting in USD) collects taxes in Europe via a tax engine (e.g., Vertex) for customers with European billing addresses?","response":"This setup is generally fine as long as the VAT amount is correctly tracked and displayed on the invoice.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Cross-border Taxation"}
{"instruction":"Is there an API to get the invoice total with a preview, similar to a billing run preview?","response":"Yes, you can use the `subscription preview` API with the appropriate target dates. It provides invoice totals and tax splits (with and without tax).","category":"Procedural","topic":"Invoice Total Preview"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to remove data for a divested business that is co-mingled in a single tenant?","response":"If Zuora Finance/Accounting periods were not used, you can mass delete the accounts (which soft deletes them). If accounting periods were closed, you cannot delete the data; you must instead \"scrub\" it by updating fields to dummy values and using scrubbing APIs.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Divested Data Removal"}
{"instruction":"Can I reverse a Credit Memo generated from an invoice if the credit amount needs to be corrected later?","response":"If the Credit Memo was generated by a bill run (e.g., proration credit), you should be able to reverse it if the \"Reverse credit memos\" permission is enabled. If it was manually created from an invoice, reversal logic may differ.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Reverse Credit Memo"}
{"instruction":"How can I get notifications for failed Async Order API calls (`v1/async/orders`) since standard notifications don't support them?","response":"There is no automatic notification feature for `v1/async/orders` failures. You must proactively track the status using the `GET_JobStatusAndResponse` API.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Async Order Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to add a feature to a subscription rate plan without overwriting existing features?","response":"No, currently the update logic requires you to read all existing features and resend the complete list (existing + new) in the update call. Sending only the new feature will overwrite the existing ones.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Update Product Features"}
{"instruction":"Can we create user roles via API for OneID?","response":"No, there is currently no official API to create user roles for OneID. While OneID uses SCIM v2, roles are not part of the exposed schema.","category":"Definitional","topic":"OneID User Roles API"}
{"instruction":"Does a CreatedById of `...0003` on a payment method indicate it was created by the PMU (Payment Method Updater)?","response":"Yes, the user ID ending in `...0003` typically belongs to the Payment Method Updater (PMU) or internal scheduler jobs.","category":"Definitional","topic":"PMU User ID"}
{"instruction":"A customer bills in arrears with quantity finalized at month-end and wants no proration. The 'Always Charge Full' setting prevents updates. How should this be handled?","response":"The recommended approach is to model this as a Usage charge. Using a recurring charge would require creating a new amendment/segment every month to update the quantity, which creates data overhead. Usage charges naturally handle variable quantities without versioning the subscription.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Usage vs Recurring Charge"}
{"instruction":"Why is unbilled usage not showing up in the UI even though usage has been uploaded?","response":"This can happen if the feature was recently enabled or if there was a snag in the migration job.

{"instruction":"Why are Revenue Schedules not being created for a Credit Memo when I specify `financeInformation` in the API?","response":"If you include `financeInformation` in the API call but leave `revenueRecognitionRuleName` empty, it may override the inherited rule with a null value. You must either provide a valid `revenueRecognitionRuleName` in the call or remove the `financeInformation` object to allow inheritance.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"CM Revenue Schedule Missing"}
{"instruction":"Why is my Report failing in the USA tenant when the same query works in the MEX tenant?","response":"The `User` table is not supported in the Reporting module (though it works in Data Query). The query in the MEX tenant likely had the `User` table commented out or removed, while the USA version included it. Removing the `User` table from the report query should fix the error.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Reporting Error User Table"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to sync the product catalog between environments if Deployment Manager is failing on certain fields?","response":"An effective alternative is to write a Data Query or Data Source export that maps fields exactly to the Data Loader templates. You can then export the data and use the Data Loader to import it into the target environment.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Product Catalog Sync"}
{"instruction":"What permission is required to use Dynamic Pricing APIs?","response":"You need the `DynamicPricing` (tenant/t9) permission. This is separate from the New Catalog or Context Attributes permissions. Support can enable this if approved by Product.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Dynamic Pricing Permission"}
{"instruction":"What happens if a payment gateway fails during reconciliation/settlement after initially marking the payment as success?","response":"Zuora typically creates an external refund with a reason code like \"Payment Rejection\" or \"Payment Reversal\" (for chargebacks). If the payment was asynchronous and in `Pending` status, the reconciliation will mark it as `Error`.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Payment Gateway Reconciliation Failure"}
{"instruction":"Can new customers enable Word templates for billing documents?","response":"Word templates are in maintenance mode and not enabled by default. While they can technically be enabled via a tenant property, it is strongly recommended to use HTML templates due to lack of new feature support and technical debt associated with Word templates.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Word Templates"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to automatically pass a Product Rate Plan Charge custom field to the Subscription Rate Plan Charge if they share the same API name?","response":"No, there is no automatic mapping.

{"instruction":"How can I fix a Prepaid Drawdown issue where a top-up mid-month doesn't cover usage from earlier in the month due to the fund start date?","response":"Backdating the effective start date of the charge does not update the fund start date. The recommended solution is to remove the top-up charge and re-add it with a start date that aligns with the beginning of the subscription period or the usage usage period.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Prepaid Drawdown Top-up"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to bill a monthly minimum charge monthly, but bill the overage only at the end of the quarter?","response":"This is difficult to achieve natively. Potential workarounds include: 1) Splitting the subscription into monthly and quarterly bills (manual), or 2) Using metering to hold usage and only submit the overage usage in the third month of the quarter (loses monthly tracking).","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Quarterly Overage Billing"}

{"instruction":"Is there a storage limit for the Audit Trail for Credit Memos and Invoices?","response":"No, there is no storage limit to worry about; this is an out-of-the-box feature.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Audit Trail"}
{"instruction":"How can I consolidate invoices from previous accounting periods into a single invoice?","response":"Zuora's Invoice Grouping is forward-looking. To consolidate past invoices, you generally need to offset or cancel the original invoices (ideally in an open accounting period) and then re-bill the period with a configuration that naturally groups the charges into a single consolidated invoice.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Invoice Consolidation"}
{"instruction":"How can I retrieve workflow usage data for workflows that are outside the cleanup period?","response":"You can check usage in Cerebro under Trends -> Workflow tasks, or via OneID -> Zuora Entitlements. Usage consumption metrics persist and can be viewed even if the specific workflow instances or tasks have been purged.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Workflow Usage"}
{"instruction":"How can I view or extract Unbilled Usage data?","response":"In the UI, you can see 'View Unbilled Usage' at the charge level on the subscription view. For extraction, Unbilled Usage is stored in the `RatingResult` object, which is accessible via the `queryRatingResults` API or through Data Query (RatingResult table). Note that this provides the usage charge amount.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Unbilled Usage"}
{"instruction":"How do I change a legacy custom field from non-indexed to indexed?","response":"You cannot simply toggle the index status of a legacy custom field. You must perform a migration: create a new indexed custom field, export the data from the old field, import it to the new field, and then swap the API names (or maintain sync via Custom Logic/Workflow until the swap is complete).","category":"Procedural","topic":"Custom Fields"}
{"instruction":"What are the recommended tax engines for EMEA and ANZ regions?","response":"A common trend is to use Zuora Tax (Z-Tax) for EU, UK, and ANZ jurisdictions as the tax tables are simpler to maintain. External tax engines like Avalara or OneSource are typically used for US and Canada. Customers often use conditional logic (e.g., Liquid) to route tax calculations to Avalara for US/CAN and Z-Tax for other regions.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Tax Engines"}
{"instruction":"Is there a specific API endpoint to check if a subscription is in a 'grace period' (unpaid renewal term)?","response":"No, there is no single 'grace period' endpoint as this is a customer-defined state. The recommended approach is to check for invoices with rejected payments related to the subscription. Note that using Data Query for single-subscription checks is not recommended due to concurrency limits; instead, you may need to chain API calls to link Subscriptions to Invoices.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"API Usage"}
{"instruction":"I am getting a 'RenewalSetting is required' error on a v1/orders API call even though the field is present. What could be the cause?","response":"This error can be misleading and may be caused by an invalid or problematic 'Idempotency-Key' parameter in the request header. Removing or fixing the idempotency key often resolves the issue.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"API Usage"}
{"instruction":"How can I access my user OAuth credentials in a sandbox if I cannot access the Users menu in the Administration settings?","response":"You can workaround the UI issue by using a direct URL: `https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/UserLogin.do?method=view&id=INSERT_ID_HERE`. You will need to query your User ID via API first to construct the link.","category":"Workaround","topic":"Sandbox Access"}
{"instruction":"When are OANDA FX rates populated in Zuora Billing?","response":"Zuora Billing pulls OANDA rates once a day. OANDA publishes one rate per currency pair per day (ending at 22:00 UTC on the previous day), so the lookback is usually 1 to 2 days in the past.","category":"Definitional","topic":"FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended strategy and duration for an Invoice Settlement migration?","response":"For large data volumes, migrations can take a weekend, during which payments and bill runs are typically paused. To minimize downtime, you can perform a background silent payment migration before the main Invoice Settlement migration. Alternatively, migrating via Invoice Settlement Harmony (ISH) can potentially result in zero downtime.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can I mass update Revenue fields like 'Right to Bill Flag' or 'Exclude Item Booking'?","response":"You can use Deployment Manager or the 'Data Backfill' option located under Revenue Settings.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Revenue Settings"}
{"instruction":"How can I mass uncheck the 'Recognize revenue without deferral' checkbox in the Product Catalog?","response":"There is no specific boolean flag for this in the object model; it is a UI interpretation. To 'uncheck' it, you must update the `DeferredRevenueAccount` field to be different from the `RecognizedRevenueAccount` field (using the accounting code name). This can be done via Data Loader.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Product Catalog"}
{"instruction":"Can I filter an Advanced Bill Run using dynamic dates like 'same as run date'?","response":"Current UI advanced filters do not support dynamic dates like 'same as run date'. However, new variables such as `{{BillRunDate}}`, `{{TargetDate}}`, and `{{InvoiceDate}}` are being introduced to support this via API, with deployment to staging starting early December 2025.","category":"Roadmap","topic":"Bill Run Filters"}
{"instruction":"How can I check if a specific workflow definition or version is currently running from within another workflow?","response":"You can use the Liquid filter `active_run_check_by_version` passing the version ID (e.g., `{{ '' | active_run_check_by_version: workflow_version_id }}`) or `active_run_check_by_definition` passing the definition ID. Alternatively, `active_run_check` returns true if any runs are in Pending, Queued, or Processing status. Note that on older tenants/workflows, if the \"Ignore Pending Status\" setting is active, the status might show as Finished even if tasks like Approval or Delay are pending.","category":"procedural","topic":"check active runs"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to add an XML document (like for Factur-x/ZUGFeRD) to an invoice PDF using Workflow?","response":"Yes, you can use the File Operations task, which was initially developed for requirements like French Factur-X, to attach XML files to PDF invoices.","category":"procedural","topic":"invoice attachments"}
{"instruction":"How can I implement bulkified error handling in a workflow to send a single success/failure email report instead of one per error?","response":"You can use a Data Query task querying the `workflow_tasks` table on the finish flow path. This allows you to retrieve the status and results of the executed tasks, which you can then compile into a CSV report to attach to a single email notification.","category":"best_practice","topic":"error handling"}
{"instruction":"How do I evaluate a boolean input variable in a Liquid If task?","response":"Liquid supports boolean types, so you can compare directly (e.g., `{% if Data.Workflow.AllowAnyMonth %}`). Ensure your comparison expression evaluates to an explicit `True` or `False`. If the input is a string \"true\"/\"false\", standard string comparison applies.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"liquid boolean logic"}
{"instruction":"How do I filter Order Actions by Invoice ID or Subscription ID since those fields aren't on the OrderAction object?","response":"You should use the Query task (which supports joins) rather than the Object Query task. Follow the Zuora Object Model path: Invoice -> InvoiceItem -> Subscription -> RatePlan -> OrderActionRatePlan -> OrderAction. Note that the Query task has limited filtering options in the UI compared to Data Query; you may need to retrieve a broader set and filter within Liquid if specific field filters are missing.","category":"procedural","topic":"querying order actions"}
{"instruction":"Where can I find logs for SFTP task errors if the task fails?","response":"If the SFTP task fails to establish a connection (due to credentials, whitelisting, or connectivity issues), Workflow logs often will not show detailed SFTP server logs. You must verify credentials and network connectivity (allowlisting Zuora IPs) externally.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"SFTP logs"}
{"instruction":"Can I use the MERGE task in a production environment?","response":"No, the Merge task is currently not granted for use in non-sandbox environments. You should use serial execution logic or the \"File Operations: CSV Creation\" task to combine data outputs.","category":"definitional","topic":"merge task"}
{"instruction":"Why do Javascript tasks sometimes get stuck in \"processing\" state indefinitely on new tenants?","response":"This can occur if the specific feature flag enabling Javascript tasks has not been turned on for the new tenant. You would need to contact Zuora support/engineering to enable it.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"javascript task"}
{"instruction":"How can I remove carriage return (\\r) characters from a string using Liquid?","response":"The standard `replace` filter may not catch special characters depending on encoding. The `strip_newlines` filter removes `\\r\\n`. For specific control, you can use regex filters.","category":"procedural","topic":"liquid string manipulation"}
{"instruction":"Can I configure Workflow to send failure notifications per workflow execution rather than per task failure?","response":"The standard workflow notification is a summary per execution. However, for high-volume real-time workflows, this can still be spammy. It is best practice to disable standard notifications for such workflows and build a custom monitoring workflow (using Data Query on `workflow_run` or `workflow_task`) to generate periodic error reports.","category":"best_practice","topic":"notifications"}
{"instruction":"Does the Liquid `date` filter return UTC or local time when using \"now\"?","response":"It typically returns UTC. To ensure the timezone is explicit, you can format the date string to include timezone information, for example: `{{ \"now\" | date: \"%FT%T%z - %Z\" }}`.","category":"definitional","topic":"liquid date time"}
{"instruction":"How can I merge two Data Query output files in Workflow?","response":"If the total row count is under 500k, you can use a single Data Query with a `UNION` operator. For larger datasets or separate files, use the \"File: FileOperations > CSV Creation\" task to merge them.","category":"procedural","topic":"merging files"}
{"instruction":"Is there a setting to automatically deactivate a workflow after a specific duration?","response":"No, there is currently no native setting to auto-deactivate a workflow after a set number of days.","category":"definitional","topic":"workflow settings"}
{"instruction":"Why does a 300KB XML payload result in a \"Data exceeds size limit of 5 MB\" error when converting to JSON?","response":"This inflation often happens if the XML structure contains significant repeated data or very long keys, which expand significantly when converted to the JSON object structure in the payload.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"payload size limit"}
{"instruction":"Is there a fix for overlapping arrows in the UI when multiple branches exit a single task?","response":"This is a known UI limitation. A workaround is to add a dummy/passthrough task on one of the branches to visually separate the paths, though this consumes an additional task execution.","category":"best_practice","topic":"UI layout"}
{"instruction":"Is there a performance difference between Liquid and JavaScript tasks?","response":"Yes, Liquid tasks are generally faster and lighter resource-wise. JavaScript tasks require spinning up a sandbox environment, which can add latency. Use Liquid for logic manipulation whenever possible.","category":"best_practice","topic":"performance"}
{"instruction":"How can I identify workflows that are using deprecated APIs?","response":"You can use Data Query on the `workflow_api_call` table (for execution history) or parse the `workflow_task` table (for definitions). Additionally, the \"System Health\" dashboard in Zuora often highlights usage of deprecated APIs.","category":"procedural","topic":"deprecated APIs"}
{"instruction":"Does Workflow reuse OAuth tokens for callouts?","response":"Yes, Workflow caches OAuth tokens until they expire. If you change the scope or requirements for the token mid-process or between runs, the cached token might be invalid. You may need to manually force a refresh or wait for expiration if scopes change.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"authentication"}
{"instruction":"Can I store a string larger than 8KB in a Custom Object field via Workflow?","response":"No, Custom Object text fields typically have a limit (e.g., 8192 characters). You cannot compress the string within Liquid to fit this limit reliably. You must split the data into multiple fields or records.","category":"limitation","topic":"custom objects"}
{"instruction":"How can I convert a local time string to UTC in Liquid?","response":"Use the `timezone` filter. For example: `{{ \"2024-09-12T15:35:00-0700\" | date: format | timezone: format, format, 'Etc/UTC' }}`. This is more reliable than `in_time_zone` which may not support all identifiers.","category":"procedural","topic":"liquid timezones"}
{"instruction":"How can I filter an array of objects in Liquid?","response":"Use the `where` or `where_exp` filter. For example: `{% assign filtered = Data.Array | where_exp: 'item', 'item.field == value' %}`. Note that complex AND/OR logic isn't directly supported inside `where_exp`; chain multiple filters or use `concat` for OR logic.","category":"procedural","topic":"liquid arrays"}
{"instruction":"What is the hard payload limit for AWS Lambda tasks in Workflow?","response":"The limit is 6MB (precisely 6,291,456 bytes), which is enforced by AWS. If your payload exceeds this, you must send a reference (file URL/ID) rather than the full data payload.","category":"limitation","topic":"lambda task"}
{"instruction":"How should I configure max concurrency for a workflow?","response":"It is recommended to set the max concurrency limit on a single task (typically the bottleneck or primary callout) rather than on every task. Setting it on multiple tasks can lead to conflicting throttling behaviors.","category":"best_practice","topic":"concurrency"}
{"instruction":"Can I execute a workflow in synchronous/responsive mode to get an immediate API response?","response":"No, synchronous mode is generally not available for new customers. You should use asynchronous patterns (fire-and-forget) and poll for results or have the workflow call back to your system.","category":"limitation","topic":"synchronous mode"}
{"instruction":"How can I get a report of task counts per workflow definition?","response":"Standard UI reporting is often tenant-wide. You can run a Data Query on the `workflow_task` and `workflow` tables, joining them to aggregate task counts by workflow definition ID over a specific date range.","category":"procedural","topic":"reporting"}
{"instruction":"Why does the Liquid date filter sometimes parse dates incorrectly (e.g., swapping day and month)?","response":"Liquid's date parsing (Ruby based) usually defaults to US format (MM/DD/YYYY). If your input is DD/MM/YYYY (e.g., \"04/01/2024\"), it may be misinterpreted. You should string-manipulate the input into ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) before passing it to the date filter.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"liquid date parsing"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to verify the HTML formatting of an email task without running it?","response":"Yes, you can use the \"Preview\" button within the Email task configuration to render the HTML and verify the layout.","category":"procedural","topic":"email task"}
{"instruction":"How do I schedule a workflow to run relative to the end of the month (e.g., 2 days before EOM)?","response":"The native scheduler is interval-based. To achieve this, schedule the workflow to run daily and add a conditional \"If\" task at the start that checks if the current date matches your target logic (e.g., `current_date == eom - 2 days`) using Liquid.","category":"procedural","topic":"scheduling"}
{"instruction":"How do I attach an invoice PDF to a Workflow email?","response":"You need the File ID of the invoice PDF.

{"instruction":"How can I delete a nested object from the workflow data payload?","response":"The \"Paths of data payload values to delete\" setting only supports top-level keys (e.g., `Data.LinkData`). It cannot reliably delete deeply nested keys (e.g., `Data.LinkData.data`). You may need to delete the parent object or overwrite the variable in Liquid (though this doesn't fully reclaim payload size for downstream limits).","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"payload management"}
{"instruction":"Why does a Workflow show as Active in the list but Inactive when opened?","response":"The list view shows the Workflow *Definition* status, while the detail view shows the status of the specific *Version* you are viewing. A definition can be active (billable) while a specific version draft is inactive.","category":"definitional","topic":"workflow status"}
{"instruction":"How does the \"Automatically retry on timeout related errors\" work for callouts?","response":"It retries any response code that is NOT listed in the \"Successful Status Code\" configuration. It does not intelligently distinguish between retryable (e.g., 500) and non-retryable (e.g., 404) errors unless you explicitly configure non-retryable errors as \"success\" and handle them in logic.","category":"best_practice","topic":"callout retry"}
{"instruction":"How can I avoid the 5MB payload size limit error?","response":"Delete unneeded data paths from the payload as early as possible using the task configuration.

{"instruction":"How can I track data (e.g., counters) across iterations in a Workflow Iterate task?","response":"Workflow Iterate tasks spawn independent threads, so local variable mutations do not persist outside the iteration. To track counts or data: 1) For errors, use `Data.Iterate.Tasks.Error`. 2) For business data, write to a custom field on a persistent object (e.g., Payment) during the iteration, then query that object using Data Query (DQ) in an 'On Complete' task. Note: Engineering advises against querying internal Workflow tables for financial reporting; use standard or custom objects instead.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Iterate Task"}
{"instruction":"What IP addresses need to be allowlisted for incoming emails from Zuora's AWS SES services?","response":"You should allowlist the IP ranges used by Amazon SES.

Best practice is to use the `SubscriptionNumber` instead of `SubscriptionId` when linking objects (like Usage) to a Subscription in API calls or Workflow tasks.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Creation"}
{"instruction":"How can I use Liquid dynamically in the \"Approval Emails\" field if the UI validation fails?","response":"If the UI rejects a standalone Liquid tag (e.g., `{{Data.Email}}`), a known workaround is to include a dummy email address alongside the tag (e.g., `dummy@example.com, {{Data.Email}}`). This satisfies the validation requirement while still processing the dynamic tag.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Approval Task"}
{"instruction":"How can I configure a Workflow to run at multiple specific times per day (e.g., 10:05 and 12:05)?","response":"In the schedule settings, you can use Cron syntax in the interval field. To specify multiple hours, use a comma-separated list. For example, `0 5 10,12 /1 * *` will run the workflow at 10:05 and 12:05. Note that the minute value (5) applies to both hours.","category":"procedural","topic":"Scheduling"}
{"instruction":"What are the requirements for setting up a Slack Bot for Workflow notifications or approvals?","response":"You must create a Slack App/Bot with a manifest including scopes like `chat:write`, `users:read`, and `users:read.email`. Install the app in your workspace, then use the generated Bot User OAuth Token in your Workflow configuration.","category":"procedural","topic":"Slack Integration"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended design for a Workflow that needs to poll an external system for many days (e.g., 25 days)?","response":"Do not keep a single Workflow instance active for extended periods (e.g., 25 days). Instead, split the process: use one Workflow to initiate the job, and a separate scheduled Workflow (e.g., running daily) to check the status until completion.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Long-Running Processes"}
{"instruction":"Does the SFTP Upload task impact Zuora API concurrency limits?","response":"It depends on the file source. If you are uploading a file generated within Workflow (internal Workflow file), it does not consume Zuora API concurrency. If you are uploading a Zuora file by ID (fetching it from Zuora first), it may trigger an API call to download the file, thus counting towards concurrency.","category":"definitional","topic":"Concurrency Limits"}
{"instruction":"What is the best method to generate a report from a Billing Preview Run in Workflow?","response":"Instead of parsing the legacy CSV/JSON output of the Billing Preview via file transformation tasks, use Data Query to select directly from the `BillingPreviewRunResult` table. This table contains the preview data and allows for SQL-based filtering and joining (e.g., with Product Rate Plan Charges) within the Workflow.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing Preview"}
{"instruction":"What are the iteration limits for manual loops in Workflow?","response":"For manual loops (created by connecting tasks in a cycle), the limit is 100 iterations in Sandbox environments and 1,000 iterations in Production environments.","category":"definitional","topic":"Limits"}
{"instruction":"How do I fix the \"At least 1 email address is required\" error when I have already typed an email in Workflow settings?","response":"The Workflow UI uses \"chips\" for email addresses. After typing the email address, you must press **Enter** or **Return** to convert the text into a chip. Simply clicking save without pressing Enter will result in the validation error.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"UI Configuration"}
{"instruction":"Why do multipart/form-data Callout tasks fail with AWS S3 or Google Drive APIs?","response":"These APIs often require specific field ordering (e.g., the 'key' or metadata must appear before the 'file' content). Currently, the Workflow Callout task may send the file content first, causing the API to reject the request. A fix (WF-9956) is in progress; there is no simple workaround using the standard Callout task without code changes.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Callout Task"}
{"instruction":"How do I handle expired `Credentials.zuora.session` tokens in long-running Workflows?","response":"The standard session token expires after 1 hour. If your workflow runs longer, use the `new_session` key (instead of `session`) in your authentication step or subsequent calls to generate a fresh session token on demand.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Authentication"}
{"instruction":"How can I access a data key in Liquid that contains a trailing dot (e.g., from an SFTP task)?","response":"Standard dot notation (e.g., `Data.File.`) will fail if the key name has special characters. Use bracket notation and quotes instead: `Data.Files['SFTP_Key_With_Dot.']['name']`.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Liquid Syntax"}
{"instruction":"How should the Private Key be formatted for the Javascript task's JWT signing function?","response":"The private key string must explicitly include the headers `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`. Missing these headers can cause an \"init failed not supported argument\" error.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Javascript Task"}
{"instruction":"Can I generate a file from a Workflow variable?","response":"Yes, using JSON/File operations. However, be aware of the 5MB payload limit for variables passed between tasks. Avoid storing large file contents in variables; instead, generate the file immediately or manipulate file handles/streams where possible.","category":"best_practice","topic":"File Generation"}
{"instruction":"What should be checked if Workflows are stuck in 'Queued' status in a Staging environment?","response":"This often indicates that the worker pool is saturated (e.g., by high-volume QA testing). The resolution typically involves assigning dedicated workers or enabling autoscaling for the specific tenant.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Infrastructure"}
{"instruction":"What is the correct endpoint for querying Workflow metrics/diagnostics?","response":"The correct endpoint for graph/metrics queries is `https://metrics.tools.admin.uw2.aws.zuora/graph`. Older URLs (e.g., `vmselect`) may be deprecated or return 404s.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Diagnostics"}
{"instruction":"What is the record limit for CSV uploads using the Direct File Input method?","response":"While not strictly capped by a hard low number, testing confirms that file sizes up to 150,000 rows can be processed successfully, provided the per-row data volume is not excessive.","category":"definitional","topic":"Limits"}
{"instruction":"Why would a workflow hit a rate limit (e.g., 3102 requests) when the task only executed 400 times?","response":"Rate limits in Workflow apply to the total number of API requests made, not just the number of tasks executed. A single task execution can generate multiple API requests (e.g., internal polling, retries). You can verify the specific request count by checking the 'API calls' tab within the task's Swimlane details.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"rate_limits"}
{"instruction":"Why do I get a 'Liquid error: Data Error: Undefined variable' in a Callout task when the same Liquid works in the Liquid Tester?","response":"The Liquid Tester often has the 'Use Strict Variables' checkbox unchecked by default, allowing undefined variables to pass. The task environment might have this checked. Try unchecking 'Use Strict Variables' in the task settings to resolve the discrepancy.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"liquid_logic"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'ExecutionDateTime' and 'ExecutionDateTimeUTC' behavior?","response":"'ExecutionDateTime' may reflect local time based on tenant settings when a workflow is started manually, but might switch to UTC when triggered by events. For consistent behavior across all trigger types, it is recommended to use 'ExecutionDateTimeUTC'.","category":"best_practice","topic":"date_time_logic"}
{"instruction":"How can I query records created more than 6 months prior to the 'Workflow.ExecutionDate' using Data Query?","response":"You can use the 'DATE' literal syntax in your query combined with Liquid to calculate the target date. For example: `SELECT * FROM table WHERE date(createddate__c) <= DATE '{{calculated_date}}'`. Ensure you calculate the date string (e.g., '2025-12-22') in a preceding Liquid step or variable.","category":"procedural","topic":"data_query"}
{"instruction":"How do I access a CSV column with a space in the header (e.g., 'DI Client Id') using Liquid?","response":"You can access keys with spaces using square bracket notation and quotes: `{{row[\"DI Client Id\"]}}`.","category":"procedural","topic":"liquid_logic"}
{"instruction":"What are the volume limitations for JSON input to a workflow via the API?","response":"There is a payload size limit of 5MB for the request body. Additionally, the HTTP request must complete within a 120-second timeout window.","category":"definitional","topic":"api_limits"}
{"instruction":"Does the Workflow Callout task support the OAuth 2.0 'Authorization Code' grant type?","response":"No, the Workflow Callout task does not currently support the Authorization Code grant type.","category":"definitional","topic":"#workflow"}
{"instruction":"Why does an 'Execute WF Task' fail with 'ID not found' even though the task ID seems correct?","response":"This error can occur if the task is configured to poll for the completion of a target workflow, and that specific target workflow instance has been deleted or cleaned up.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"#workflow"}
{"instruction":"How do I display HTML in a Responsive UI Action using the Response Formatter task?","response":"You can pass a string containing the HTML within the JSON response. Ensure the HTML string is properly escaped or quoted within the JSON structure (e.g., `\"<html>...</html>\"`).","category":"procedural","topic":"ui_actions"}
{"instruction":"Can I generate a hash for a large CSV export within Workflow to verify file integrity?","response":"You can compute a hash (e.g., MD5) via Liquid or JavaScript for small files that fit in the payload. However, for large files (e.g., large Data Query exports), loading the file into memory to compute the hash is not feasible due to size limits.","category":"definitional","topic":"file_handling"}
{"instruction":"Why don't the 'Updated By' and 'Updated At' fields change when I deactivate a workflow?","response":"Activating or deactivating a workflow updates the workflow definition level, not the specific version. These changes might not be visible on the version history UI but can be tracked via Data Query on the workflow table or logs.","category":"definitional","topic":"#workflow"}
{"instruction":"Does using a Delay task to wait for an hour hold system resources or risk being flagged?","response":"No, the Delay task simply pauses the workflow run for the specified duration. Subsequent tasks execute after the delay. It does not actively hold resources in a way that would cause resource exhaustion issues.","category":"definitional","topic":"performance"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to configure the Iterate task to run sequentially instead of in parallel?","response":"The Iterate task is designed for parallel execution ('divide and conquer'). To achieve sequential processing, you must configure Swimlanes and decision tasks (If/Case) to flow linearly, or use a 'Single Threaded Loop' pattern (e.g., a task calling itself).","category":"best_practice","topic":"iteration_logic"}
{"instruction":"How can I report on Workflow task usage history beyond the 45-day retention period?","response":"Workflow data is cleaned up every 45 days. To maintain historical reporting (e.g., 12-month trends), you should regularly export Data Query results (e.g., every 40 days) to external storage for offline analysis.","category":"best_practice","topic":"reporting"}
{"instruction":"Why does the Iterate task with 'Unique Field' only process the first row for each key?","response":"This is the intended behavior of the 'Unique Field' iteration type; it picks the first row for each unique key. If you need to process all data associated with that key, you should aggregate the data into a single row within your Data Query (e.g., using `ARRAY_AGG` or `MAP_AGG`) before iterating.","category":"best_practice","topic":"iteration_logic"}
{"instruction":"How can I remove the xml version declaration from the output of an XML Transform task?","response":"In your XSLT configuration, use the output method `text` instead of `xml`. For example: `<xsl:output method=\"text\" indent=\"yes\" ... />`. This prevents the XML declaration (`<?xml ... ?>`) from being automatically generated.","category":"procedural","topic":"xml_transform"}
{"instruction":"What is the actual concurrency limit for Data Query tasks in Workflow?","response":"Workflow allows 5 Data Query tasks to process concurrently per tenant. While the Data Query service might queue more requests (e.g., up to 15), Workflow itself throttles active processing to 5.","category":"definitional","topic":"concurrency"}
{"instruction":"Can I transform a large XML file using the XML Transform task without hitting the 5MB payload limit?","response":"Yes, as long as you do not write the transformed data into the workflow payload (the `data` object). If the transformation reads from a file and writes to a file, it can handle larger sizes.","category":"best_practice","topic":"file_handling"}
{"instruction":"Can I upload a file as input when triggering a workflow via the Run Workflow API?","response":"No, file inputs are not supported via the Run Workflow API due to volume handling limitations. The API supports JSON object payloads (`application/json`).","category":"definitional","topic":"api_limits"}
{"instruction":"Where can I see the file uploaded to a workflow or generated during a run?","response":"You can find files associated with a workflow run in the 'Files' tab of the run detail view, or in the 'Run History' section.","category":"procedural","topic":"troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"Does Workflow have the ability to read files directly from S3?","response":"Yes, you can read files from S3 using the standard Callout task if the S3 bucket provides a public API or accessible URL.","category":"procedural","topic":"integrations"}
{"instruction":"How can I schedule the same workflow to run at different times for different Organizations (Orgs) in a multi-org tenant?","response":"You can create multiple schedules for the workflow (one for each required time). Then, within the workflow, use an If/Case task to check the current Organization ID and execute the appropriate logic for that Org.","category":"best_practice","topic":"scheduling"}
{"instruction":"Why does my Callout task fail with '400 Unable to process JSON' when constructing a JSON payload manually?","response":"Ensure that all keys in your JSON structure are wrapped in double quotes (e.g., `\"key\": \"value\"`). Missing quotes around keys is a common cause of invalid JSON errors in manual payload construction.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"json_construction"}
{"instruction":"Why is my Case task not matching a value that appears correct in the Liquid Tester?","response":"Check for trailing or leading whitespace in the value configuration of the Case task. Extra spaces can cause the match to fail even if the visible characters look identical.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"liquid_logic"}
{"instruction":"Is the concurrency limit applied per workflow run or per workflow definition?","response":"Concurrency limits are capped per workflow *definition*. For example, if a task has a concurrency limit of 5, and there are 20 concurrent runs of that workflow, only 5 instances of that task will run simultaneously across all runs.","category":"definitional","topic":"concurrency"}
{"instruction":"Can we customize the sender number for the SMS task?","response":"The native SMS task does not support customizing the sender number. The recommended best practice is to use a standard Callout task to integrate with a provider like Twilio directly, where you can control the sender ID.","category":"best_practice","topic":"sms_task"}
{"instruction":"What does the error 'Absolute max of 5 retries achieved' mean?","response":"Workflow has an internal system-level retry mechanism (usually 5 attempts) for handling transient failures, which is separate from the user-configured 'Max Retry Count' in the task settings. This error indicates the system retries have been exhausted.","category":"definitional","topic":"error_handling"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to create a .txt file from a JSON output in a workflow task, and how can the file be renamed?","response":"Yes, it is possible. To create a file, you can use the \"Generate custom doc\" approach where you ensure the output in the file is your desired content (e.g., JSON), and then rename the resulting file. By default, the file might be created with an extension like .html or .json, but you can rename it to .txt using the file download and renaming capabilities available in tasks like the email task or by following specific file manipulation steps outlined in internal documentation (e.g., method 3 in the referenced \"Producing a .json file from Workflow\" page).","category":"procedural","topic":"File Conversion"}
{"instruction":"Why is the autocomplete feature in the liquid tester disabled or not working?","response":"The autocomplete feature in the liquid tester has been disabled due to a known issue or licensing problem (specifically mentioned as a licensing issue in some contexts). It is expected to be disabled in the next release, with a new autocomplete solution planned for release shortly thereafter.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Liquid Tester"}
{"instruction":"Why does a workflow scheduled to run on a specific schedule only execute on demand?","response":"A workflow version must be active for it to run via a schedule. If the specific version is inactive, the schedule will not trigger the execution.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Workflow Scheduling"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to query an S3 bucket to filter data and create a CSV file with detailed processed events post-bill run using Workflow?","response":"Currently, there is no direct out-of-the-box Workflow task to query S3 buckets and filter data in that manner. Users often look for alternatives or ask if this is on the roadmap, but no immediate confirmation of this specific feature exists in the current context.","category":"comparison","topic":"S3 Integration"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to merge multiple invoice PDF files into a single PDF document using Workflow?","response":"There is no native capability in Workflow to merge multiple PDF files. Doing so would require complex byte manipulation which is not supported. The recommended approach is to use a 3rd party engine invoked by the Workflow to perform the merge, though this involves sending customer data to an external processor which raises privacy and GDPR considerations.","category":"best_practice","topic":"PDF Merging"}
{"instruction":"How can I access input parameters defined in Workflow settings when triggering the workflow via API?","response":"When defining input parameters in Workflow settings for API triggering, you must populate the \"Input Field Name\" option for the parameter to be correctly mapped and accessible from the API payload.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"API Input Parameters"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to view workflow logs or history older than 30 days?","response":"By default, the UI may only show recent history (e.g., <30 days). To view older logs, you can query the `workflow_task` object via Data Query and filter using `createddate`. Additionally, the cleanup policy can potentially be increased (e.g., to 45 days) to retain logs longer.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow Logs"}
{"instruction":"Can I use an HTML invoice template from \"Manage Billing Document Configuration\" in a \"Create Invoice\" workflow task?","response":"No. The templates in \"Manage Billing Document Configuration\" use core billing technologies (Word/Aspose or HTML/Unlayer) which are distinct from the workflow task that typically uses a Puppeteer/Node library approach. You cannot directly reuse a core billing template in that specific workflow task.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"Why am I unable to retrieve subscription-level fields in a Callout Template workflow mapping when triggering based on a callout configuration?","response":"Historically, custom events could not send an array of child objects (like subscriptions) in the data payload. However, this feature was added in the 2025.Q3 release. You can now select linked objects like Subscriptions and Products for templates linked to Order events.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Callout Templates"}
{"instruction":"Can I configure custom logic to trigger only on Invoice Create (not Update) without triggering the workflow on every update?","response":"There was a configuration option to select \"Create\" vs \"Update\" triggers, but users have reported it missing from the UI, suggesting it might be a bug or regression. Without this option visible, avoiding triggers on updates is difficult.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Trigger Logic"}
{"instruction":"How do I get the file output from an \"Export a report run\" API call in Workflow?","response":"The response from the export report run API typically contains a file ID. You should use that file ID in a subsequent \"File Download\" task to retrieve the actual file. If the file ID is missing from the response, verify the API version and response format.","category":"procedural","topic":"Report Export"}
{"instruction":"How can I convert a Liquid array into a CSV file using the JSON task and CSV processor?","response":"To convert a Liquid array to CSV, the array must consist of flat JSON objects. If any item in the array contains nested objects or arrays, the conversion will fail with an \"invalid array\" error.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Conversion"}
{"instruction":"How can I get the details of a specific custom object record if I only have a `TemplateID` (not the system ID) and cannot use Data Query?","response":"You can use the `Query Record` task or the `GET /object-query` API (specifically `GET /settings/custom-objects/objects/{object}/records`) to find records by filtering on specific fields like `TemplateID`, provided that field is indexed.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom Object Query"}
{"instruction":"How do I perform a callout to another Zuora tenant to get a bearer token if `x-www-form-urlencoded` is greyed out?","response":"You do not need to perform a separate task to get a token. Instead, use the \"Authentication\" tab in the callout task to enter the OAuth credentials for the target tenant. If the target is a multi-entity tenant, ensure you pass the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` header to specify the correct entity.","category":"procedural","topic":"Cross-Tenant Callouts"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to increase the max concurrency for workflow tasks to avoid task exhaustion errors?","response":"Concurrency limits are generally fixed unless a \"Performance Booster\" pack is purchased, which provides double concurrency limits and a dedicated workflow worker. Temporary increases are typically not granted; the recommended path is optimizing workflows or purchasing the performance add-on.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Concurrency Limits"}
{"instruction":"Can I rename a file inside a ZIP archive generated by a Data Query before uploading it via SFTP?","response":"There is no direct setting to rename a file inside a ZIP generated by Data Query. A workaround involves getting the raw file, renaming it within the Workflow (e.g., via file manipulation tasks), zipping the renamed file, and then uploading the new ZIP.","category":"procedural","topic":"File Manipulation"}
{"instruction":"How can I process a row-separated text file (no headers) into an array where each row is an element?","response":"If the data fits within the 5MB payload limit, you can use the `read_file` filter to ingest the text file. This allows you to treat the content as a string which can then be split by newline characters to form an array.","category":"procedural","topic":"File Parsing"}
{"instruction":"How do I handle file names with special characters (like dots) in the payload that break Liquid parsing?","response":"Special characters in keys can break standard dot-notation in Liquid. You may need to reference the data using bracket notation (e.g., `Data['file.name']`) or follow specific workarounds for accessing data with special characters documented in previous threads.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Liquid Syntax"}
{"instruction":"Why does the GraphQL Query task fail or not return expected results for Bill Runs with multiple invoices?","response":"The GraphQL Query task might not be suitable for complex filtering on child objects like Invoices within a Bill Run context. A recommended alternative is to use the `object-query/invoices` API with filters, or for larger datasets, use Data Query or Export which handle bulk data better than synchronous queries.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"GraphQL Query"}
{"instruction":"How do concurrent synchronous tasks (Callout, Query, Object Query) behave in an iteration?","response":"These tasks are synchronous, so the workflow will wait for the response of each before proceeding. Note that if an iteration takes more than 3 hours, it will time out. Additionally, you cannot access the results of individual iterations in the `On-Complete` block because they execute in separate contexts.","category":"definitional","topic":"Task Execution"}
{"instruction":"Can I convert UTF-8 data from a Data Query to UTF-16 within a Workflow?","response":"Workflow tasks typically output UTF-8. There is no standard, simple task configuration to convert character encodings like UTF-8 to UTF-16 directly within the workflow logic.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Character Encoding"}
{"instruction":"What is the maximum number of iterations allowed for a loop in Workflow?","response":"The maximum number of repeat times (iterations) for a loop is 100 in the Sandbox environment and 1000 in the Production environment.","category":"definitional","topic":"Workflow Limits"}
{"instruction":"How can I solve a race condition when updating a shared account-level field during a parallel `For Each` loop?","response":"To avoid race conditions in parallel iterations, use a sequential loop instead of the standard parallel `Iterate` task. A sequential loop can be manually built by connecting a task back to an earlier step with a condition to exit, ensuring one item is processed at a time.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Loop Concurrency"}
{"instruction":"Can I run a Data Query inside an Iterate task loop?","response":"Running a Data Query inside an Iterate task is strongly discouraged (and often effectively forbidden) because it can trigger a massive number of extraction jobs (O(n)), overwhelming the system limits. It is better to perform a single bulk query upfront and then filter or map the results in memory using Liquid or subsequent steps.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Query usage"}
{"instruction":"Why is a target workflow not appearing in the \"Execute Task\" dropdown?","response":"The target workflow must be a near real-time or synchronous workflow (callout enabled), must be active, and must have a specific active version. Additionally, a real-time workflow cannot execute a batch workflow.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Execute Task"}
{"instruction":"How do I update a Global Constant if the edit option is missing?","response":"If you cannot see an edit button, you may be able to overwrite the value by typing in the field and tabbing out. Note that for security reasons, values are often masked, and recent updates have made them write-only or hidden.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Global Constants"}
{"instruction":"Why is my workflow triggered by a custom \"Bill Run Posted\" event running twice?","response":"The \"Bill Run Posted\" event might trigger multiple times if the Bill Run object is updated multiple times while in the 'Posted' state. To prevent this, configure the event filter to check the old field value (e.g., `Status != Posted` AND `Status = Posted`) to ensure it only triggers on the state transition.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Event Triggers"}
{"instruction":"Can Workflow directly trigger a standard Zuora email notification?","response":"Workflow cannot directly \"call\" a notification. Notifications are triggered by events. To send a standard notification, you must trigger the underlying event, for example, by updating a custom field that is configured to fire a custom event/notification.","category":"procedural","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Is it expected that `Data.Workflow.ExecutionDateTime` is missing when triggered by 'On Billing Event'?","response":"Yes, some system values like timestamps might be missing or different in the payload for event-triggered workflows compared to scheduled ones, due to how the Kafka message payload is constructed for notifications.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Payload"}
{"instruction":"How do I filter records based on date (e.g., current month) in an Object Query?","response":"Object Query (ZOQL) has limited date functions. You typically calculate the required date range (e.g., `FirstOfMonth` and `FirstOfNextMonth`) using Liquid filters (`date`, `date_manip`) in a previous step, and then inject those values into the WHERE clause of your query.","category":"procedural","topic":"Date Filtering"}
{"instruction":"How can I convert a string to a float while retaining decimal precision (e.g., \"18.39\" to 18.39)?","response":"Standard Liquid filters like `plus: 0.0` might sometimes result in truncation or unexpected formatting if there are hidden characters (like whitespace). Ensure the string is trimmed (`strip`) before applying math filters. If issues persist, verifying the raw string for whitespace is a critical first step.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Liquid Math"}
{"instruction":"How can I send a file to the Data Loader API via Workflow given the multipart/form-data limitations?","response":"Workflow has limitations with ordering multipart fields which Data Loader requires (e.g., the 'key' field must come before the file). A known workaround is to pass the file content as a text field named \"file\" as the last parameter, rather than attaching the file as a binary, though this is not the standard intended usage.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Loader Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can I use the `id` field as an input variable for a Workflow triggered via API?","response":"No, `id` is a system field name and tends to get dropped or cause conflicts in the integration layer. You should use a different variable name (e.g., `zuoraId`, `recordId`) instead of reserved system names like `id`.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Naming Conventions"}
{"instruction":"How can I build an array in Liquid to iterate over later?","response":"You can build a JSON string representing an array (using `capture`) and then parse it using the `parse_json` filter. Alternatively, you can initialize an empty array by splitting an empty string and then using specific filters to push elements, though the JSON parsing method is often more robust for complex objects.","category":"procedural","topic":"Liquid Arrays"}
{"instruction":"Why am I receiving an Entity ID error when specifying {{Credentials.zuora.entities.id}} in a workflow, and how can I fix it?","response":"The error likely occurs because {{Credentials.zuora.entities.id}} returns a 36-hex-digit UUID, while the API may require a 32-hex-digit UUID or a different format. A recommended fix is to use {{Credentials.zuora.entity_id}} instead. However, the safest best practice is to configure a Client ID/Secret globally that has access to a single entity, which avoids this error entirely.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Entity ID"}
{"instruction":"Can we configure custom headers for Workflow Email Notification tasks (e.g., for Amazon SES integration)?","response":"Yes, support for custom headers in Workflow Email Notification tasks was released in version 2025.Q4.1.0. To use this, you must update each email callout task configuration individually. This allows passing headers like configuration sets required by external SMTP servers.","category":"procedural","topic":"Email Headers"}
{"instruction":"How do I authenticate an API callout from Zuora Billing to Zuora Revenue within a workflow?","response":"Authentication from Billing to Revenue is a two-step process, as standard workflow-based auth options apply to Billing only. First, send a callout to the Revenue API endpoint `/api/integration/v1/authenticate` with the relevant credentials to retrieve a token. Second, use the returned token in a header named 'token' for subsequent file uploads or API calls to Revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"Billing to Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How does the Iterate task behave when 'Unique-Field' is selected and multiple records share the same unique field value?","response":"When the Iterate task is configured with the 'Unique-Field' iteration type, if the Data Query returns multiple records with the same unique identifier, the task picks up the first record found.","category":"definitional","topic":"Iterate Task"}
{"instruction":"Why is only one file being sent in my Workflow callout even though I configured two files with the same parameter name (e.g., documentFiles)?","response":"This is a known regression/issue. If you configure a Workflow callout to send multiple files using the same key/parameter name, only one file is successfully sent. This behavior differs from tools like Postman where multiple files under the same key work correctly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"File Upload"}
{"instruction":"How should I handle Liquid errors stating 'results should be Array instead of Hash' when iterating over upstream results?","response":"This error occurs when an upstream task returns a single object (Hash) instead of a list (Array). To handle this reliability, add logic to check the size of the results. If `results.size > 1`, proceed with iteration; if `results.size == 1`, handle it as a single object. Alternatively, ensure the upstream transformation forces the output into an array format.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Iterate Task"}
{"instruction":"I am receiving a parameter update error on a workflow migrated from Production to Sandbox. What might be the cause?","response":"This is likely due to the Data Retention (TTL) setting. Production environments often support a `delete_ttl` of 90 days, while Sandboxes are limited to 45 days. To resolve this, export the workflow definition, change `\"delete_ttl\": 90` to `\"delete_ttl\": 45` in the JSON, and re-import it.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Workflow Migration"}
{"instruction":"Why do downloaded PDF files in Workflow have a timestamp suffix, and can I remove it?","response":"Workflow automatically appends a current timestamp to filenames (e.g., `filename_123456789.pdf`) to ensure uniqueness. This is expected behavior. If you need the original filename, you must use Liquid logic to extract or rename the file downstream.","category":"definitional","topic":"File Names"}

{"instruction":"How can I set up a charge in Zuora to bill for usage overage as a one-time charge for the remaining period, instead of monthly?","response":"Zuora does not natively support one-time, remaining-period usage overage billing. The recommended approach is to input the total overage quantity for the remaining period as a single usage record, then run a bill run to generate the charge. While Zuora allows combining usage-based charges with annual billing, manipulating quantities and amounts outside the standard monthly cycle can be risky and may lead to errors. For most use cases, it's safer to input the total overage as a single record and bill accordingly, rather than trying to alter the billing cycle for usage charges.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage overage one-time billing in Zuora"}

{"instruction":"How can I configure Zuora to allow late usage data entry for closed accounting periods, and what are the implications for billing and accounting?","response":"If you enable the setting to allow usage data entry for closed accounting periods, you can register usage with a date in a closed period, but it will only be billed in the next open period. Processed usage data cannot be deleted unless the related invoice is also deleted. For accounting, the revenue will be recognized in the month the invoice is issued, not the usage date. If you need to record the actual service date, use a custom field for the true usage date and display it on invoices or reports. Enabling this setting does not directly impact accounting, but you should review your business processes to ensure this approach fits your needs.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Late usage entry and accounting in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can I determine the correct field to use for 'customerAcceptanceDate' in Zuora reports and display it on the subscription page layout?","response":"In Zuora reports, 'customerAcceptanceDate' is labeled as '契約受入日' (Contract Acceptance Date) in Japanese. Add this field to your report to access the data. On the subscription page, this field is not directly displayed; you can use the subscription start date as a proxy, as it usually matches the customer acceptance date unless intentionally set differently. Alternatively, filter the subscription history for version 1 (v1) to find the acceptance date, which corresponds to OrderAction.CustomerAcceptanceDate.

{"instruction":"How can I troubleshoot a Zuora workflow that creates orders, where some orders fail with a lock competition error due to parallel processing on the same account, and what is the best way to handle this?","response":"Order creation in Zuora applies a lock at the account level, so running multiple order creations in parallel for the same account can cause lock competition errors. To avoid this, do not process multiple orders for the same account simultaneously. Instead, split your data so that each batch only includes unique accounts, or process orders for the same account sequentially. Adjusting workflow parallelism and retry parameters can help, but fundamentally, avoid parallel processing on the same account to prevent lock errors.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Handling lock competition in Zuora workflow order creation"}

{"instruction":"How can I set up a charge in Zuora to bill for usage overage as a one-time charge for the remaining period, instead of monthly?","response":"Zuora does not natively support one-time, remaining-period usage overage billing. The best practice is to input the total overage quantity for the remaining period as a single usage record, then run a bill run to generate the charge. Manipulating quantities and amounts outside the standard monthly cycle can be risky and may lead to errors. For most use cases, input the total overage as a single record and bill accordingly.","category":"best_practice","topic":"One-time usage overage billing in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can I identify and extract customers with three or more consecutive failed payment attempts, and also retrieve the date of the last failed payment in Zuora?","response":"To identify customers with three or more consecutive failed payment attempts and retrieve the date of the last failed payment, you should use the standard Zuora report: 'Payment recovery during retry' found under Reports > Zuora Standard Reports > Collections > Analysis. This report includes fields such as 'NumConsecutiveFailures' (number of consecutive failures) and 'LastFailedSaleTransactionDate' (date of last failed sale transaction). These fields allow you to filter for accounts with three or more consecutive failures and to see the most recent failure date. If you do not see these fields, ensure you are referencing the correct data source and report type.","category":"procedural","topic":"failed payment analysis"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for updating an account's payment terms and default payment method using a Zuora Workflow, and why might a workflow show as 'success' but not actually update the account?","response":"When using a Zuora Workflow (WF) to update an account's payment terms and default payment method, ensure that the API call within the workflow is correctly configured. Specifically, add the 'rejectUnknownFields=true' parameter to the update API endpoint (e.g., /v1/action/update?rejectUnknownFields=true). This causes the API to return an error if there are any typos or incorrect field names in the request body, rather than silently ignoring them. Also, the body of the request must match the field names and structure defined in the CRUD: Update an account API documentation. If the workflow shows 'success' but the account is not updated, it is likely due to incorrect field names or missing the 'rejectUnknownFields' parameter, which causes the API to ignore invalid fields without error. Always validate your request body and use the correct API parameters to ensure updates are applied.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"workflow account update"}
{"instruction":"How can I update a custom field on a RatePlan when a product is removed from a subscription, and is it possible to do this without using Zuora Workflow?","response":"To update a custom field on a RatePlan when a product is removed, you can use a custom event triggered by an OrderAction of type 'RemoveProduct'. This event can initiate a callout that updates the RatePlan's custom field. The callout can reference the RemoveRatePlan information from the OrderAction event. This process can be implemented using the Update API, and does not necessarily require a Workflow if the update is simple. However, if you need to automate or chain more complex logic, Workflow may be beneficial. The key is that the callout can be configured to update the RatePlan custom field directly using the information from the OrderAction event.","category":"procedural","topic":"rateplan custom field update"}
{"instruction":"How can I disable the Stripe v2 gateway in a Zuora test environment for temporary testing, and what is the impact on card registration and payment intent creation?","response":"To temporarily disable the Stripe v2 gateway in a Zuora test environment, adjust the settings in the 'Payment Page' configuration. Within the page settings, you can select which payment gateway is used for card registration. By switching the gateway selection, you can control whether Stripe v2 is used during card registration. If you disable only the connector (not the card registration feature), Zuora will not perform a setupIntent during card registration, and card details will be stored on the account without triggering a PaymentIntent at the time of collection. This allows you to test workflows where card information is present in Zuora but setupIntent is not called until a later step. If the gateway does not appear as an option, check that the tenant settings are enabled for the desired gateway.","category":"procedural","topic":"stripe gateway disablement"}
{"instruction":"How can I determine if a payment in Zuora was triggered by an automated collection process or by an external system/API, and what fields should I check?","response":"To determine the origin of a payment in Zuora, check the 'Payment.Source' field. Payments can be triggered either by scheduled collections (e.g., bill runs) or by on-demand actions via API or UI. If 'Payment.Source' is set to 'API', it indicates the payment was initiated by an external system or API call. If it is not 'API', it was likely triggered by Zuora's internal collection process. You can use reports to review this field and identify the source of each payment. Additionally, the decision to process a card payment depends on several conditions: Account.AutoPay must be true, PaymentMethod.NumConsecutiveFailures must be below the retry limit, Invoice.AutoPay must be true, and Invoice.DueDate must be on or before the payment date.","category":"definitional","topic":"payment source identification"}
{"instruction":"How can I use Liquid expressions in Zuora Workflow to filter a list for items where a boolean field is not true, and what are the limitations?","response":"In Zuora Workflow, to filter a list for items where a boolean field is not true using Liquid, you should use the 'where_exp' extension. For example: {{Data.SubscriptionList.subscriptions | where_exp: \"subscription\", \"subscription.status != 'Active'\" | to_json}}. For boolean fields, you can use: {{Data.GetOrder.order.subscriptions | where_exp: \"subscription\", \"subscription.customFields.IsServiceProvision__c != true\" | to_json}}. Note that this filtering works in Liquid tasks, but not directly within Iterate tasks. To work around this, perform the filtering in a Liquid task and then use the resulting list in Iterate.","category":"procedural","topic":"liquid filtering in workflow"}
{"instruction":"How can I update a picklist-type custom field to null (unset) via the Zuora API, and can this approach be used for other non-required fields?","response":"To set a picklist-type custom field to null (unset) via the Zuora API, include the field name in the 'fieldsToNull' array in your API request body. For example: 'fieldsToNull': ['MultiYearContractType__c']. This approach can be used for any non-required field, not just picklists. When processing a batch update, separate the records that need to be set to null from those that need a value, or use conditional logic in your workflow to handle both cases appropriately.","category":"procedural","topic":"api null custom field"}
{"instruction":"How can I group and analyze discount data in Zuora, and what are the relevant tables and fields for understanding discount application?","response":"Discount application in Zuora is determined at the time of invoice generation. To analyze discounts, use the InvoiceItem object as the central axis. The field 'InvoiceItem.AppliedToInvoiceItemId' links discount invoice items to the charge invoice items they apply to. For master data on discount applicability, use the 'productdiscountapplydetail' table for catalog-level definitions and 'discountapplydetail' for contract-specific definitions, accessible via DataQuery. However, discounts can also be applied at broader levels (entire plan, subscription, or account), in which case these tables may not have entries, and only invoice data will reflect the actual application. For reporting, aggregate InvoiceItem data to see which charges received discounts and the amounts involved. Note that 'productdiscountapplydetail' is not available via Export ZOQL, only via DataQuery.","category":"definitional","topic":"discount data analysis"}
{"instruction":"How can I use Zuora's deployment manager to migrate product catalog changes between environments, and what are common errors and their resolutions?","response":"To migrate product catalog changes using Zuora's deployment manager, ensure that all dependencies (such as finance settings, revenue recognition rules, and units of measure) are consistent between source and target environments. Common errors include missing dependencies like accounting codes or revenue recognition rules. The recommended approach is to manually align the sandbox environment's finance settings with production before attempting migration. If you encounter errors updating accounting codes (e.g., renaming '前受金' to '前受収益'), you may need to temporarily reassign charges to a different code, perform the rename, and then reassign them back. For bulk updates, Data Loader can be used, but some changes may require support intervention. If Data Loader updates do not succeed, contact Zuora support for assistance.","category":"procedural","topic":"deployment manager product catalog"}
{"instruction":"How can I filter out invoice line items with zero value in Zuora HTML templates, and how can I round calculated values for display?","response":"To filter out invoice line items with zero value in Zuora HTML templates, use the 'FilterByValue' function: InvoiceItems|FilterByValue(ChargeAmount,GT,0). For rounding calculated values, use the 'Round' function, specifying the number of decimal places and rounding method (e.g., Round(0,HALF_UP)), and optionally combine with 'Localise' for formatting (e.g., {{#Wp_Eval}} {{Usage.Quantity}} * {{InvoiceItem.UnitPrice}}|Round(0,HALF_UP)|Localise(ja_JP) {{/Wp_Eval}}). This will round to the nearest whole number and format according to Japanese locale.","category":"procedural","topic":"html template filtering and rounding"}
{"instruction":"How can I determine the data center location of my Zuora tenant?","response":"You can determine your Zuora tenant's data center by checking the URL of your UI.

{"instruction":"How can I analyze which users have not migrated to Zuora OneID, and what are the implications for API and UI access?","response":"Users who have not migrated to Zuora OneID can still access the local tenant UI using Basic authentication, except for API users, for whom Basic authentication may be disabled after migration. For API users (such as those used for 360sync or Quote integration), do not migrate them to OneID until the relevant integrations support OAuth. Regular users should be migrated to OneID as soon as possible, as local login may be disabled at any time. There is no strict deadline for non-API users, but early migration is recommended to avoid access issues. For API users, continue using Basic authentication until Zuora announces support for OAuth in those integrations.","category":"definitional","topic":"oneid migration implications"}
{"instruction":"How can I use Salesforce and Zuora's zAPI to create usage records from Salesforce, and what are the available methods?","response":"You can create usage records in Zuora from Salesforce using the zAPI.zCreate() method, which internally uses the CRUD API and supports usage creation. Alternatively, you can use zAPI.sendRequest(), which is a wrapper around Salesforce's System.HttpRequest and allows you to call any Zuora API endpoint, including usage creation.

{"instruction":"Is it possible to apply a discount to only the delta value when a customer upgrades from one product to another, rather than applying the discount to the full price of the new product?","response":"By default, when a customer upgrades from one product to another in Zuora, the system credits the initial product's full price and applies the discount to the full price of the new product, resulting in a net invoice that does not reflect a discount on just the price difference. There is no out-of-the-box way to apply a discount solely to the delta (difference) between the old and new product prices. Achieving this would require a custom solution or workaround, as the standard product upgrade process does not support discounting only the delta value.","category":"definitional","topic":"discount application on product upgrade delta"}
{"instruction":"How can I tie usage records to invoice items or charges generated from that usage, especially in scenarios involving rollup usage across multiple accounts?","response":"The linkage between usage records and invoice items is established through the Processed Usage object. The typical relationship is Usage > Processed Usage > Invoice Item. This linkage also works for rolled-up usage scenarios, where a single usage record may be billed and invoiced across multiple accounts (such as in a parent-child account relationship). Each invoice item can be traced back to the processed usage records, which in turn are linked to the original usage records. Note that a single charge or invoice item is typically linked with multiple usage records.","category":"definitional","topic":"usage-to-invoice linkage and reconciliation"}
{"instruction":"What is the logic behind how Zuora splits up usage charge items in invoices for a usage charge with Drawdown + Credit Commitment charge function, and why might the quantity split not match the expected values?","response":"For usage charges with Drawdown + Credit Commitment, Zuora splits the invoice line items based on the amount percentage. The system uses the formula: (minimum commitment amount / total amount) * total quantity to determine the split. This can result in quantities that do not exactly match the expected values, especially when currency-based calculations are involved. For example, if the minimum commitment amount is 15,499,000 (from 22,000 units at $70.45 each), the displayed quantity might be slightly higher (e.g., 22,046) due to the way the amount percentage is used to split the quantity. This behavior is by design, but may lead to small discrepancies in the split quantities.","category":"definitional","topic":"usage charge quantity split logic with drawdown and credit commitment"}
{"instruction":"If a prepaid charge and a top-up are created on the same day, how does Zuora determine which balance to draw down from first? Is it always FIFO based on record creation?","response":"When a prepaid charge and a top-up are created on the same day, Zuora will draw down from the original prepaid charge first before beginning to draw down from the top-up, provided the unit of measure (UOM) is the same, it is not a rollover scenario, and the start date is the same. The system uses a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) approach based on which record was created earlier in the database.","category":"definitional","topic":"prepaid charge drawdown order"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora's usage object handle 2 million usage records per day across two accounts, and what are the performance or system limitations?","response":"Handling 2 million usage records per day (60 million per month) is at the very high end of Zuora's documented limits. Officially, Zuora expects no more than 25 million usage records per month, and exceeding this may require consultation with your account manager and could have licensing implications. For legacy rater, there is a hard limit of 200,000 usage records per charge due to memory constraints, and exceeding this can cause bill runs to fail. The advanced consumption rater is more capable and can handle higher volumes, but still needs to create processed usage records. Performance is also impacted by the number of usage charges. If you plan to exceed these limits, you should consult with Zuora for guidance and possible accommodations.","category":"definitional","topic":"usage object scalability and performance limits"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to use the InvoiceGroupNumber field for standalone invoices and credit memos, and what are the limitations or workarounds?","response":"The InvoiceGroupNumber field cannot be set for standalone invoices and standalone credit memos. This limitation means that while you can tag invoices generated from subscriptions or order line items (OLIs) with InvoiceGroupNumber, you cannot do so for standalone invoices. As a workaround, you can use a custom field (e.g., InvoiceGroupNumberAlt__c) when creating standalone invoices and implement custom logic to copy this field to credit memos if needed. However, this approach is less clean than being able to use the standard InvoiceGroupNumber field directly.","category":"definitional","topic":"InvoiceGroupNumber on standalone invoices and credit memos"}
{"instruction":"What are the current limitations and roadmap for supporting flexible billing attributes on credit memo templates, and is there a plan to address regressions after migrating to Invoice Settlement (IS)?","response":"Currently, flexible billing attributes are supported on most billing documents, but not on credit memo templates. This limitation has caused a regression for customers who previously used negative invoices with flexible billing attributes before migrating to Invoice Settlement (IS). The enhancement to support flexible billing attributes on credit memo templates is being tracked under the epic INV-15796, but there is no ETA as the team is focused on other priorities.

{"instruction":"What are the documented and practical limits for the number of subscriptions that can be included in a bill run using the advanced filter, and can this limit be increased?","response":"The advanced filter in bill runs allows a maximum of 10 subscription numbers per condition group, and you can create up to two layers of conditions or condition groups. While documentation may mention a limit of 50 subscriptions (if all belong to the same account), the practical limit for filtering by subscription number across different accounts is 10. This limit is enforced to manage system performance. Increasing the limit would require a business justification and is not currently supported.

{"instruction":"How does Zuora handle usage plan replacement when usage is loaded for a plan that is then removed and replaced with a new plan (same UOM) as of the same date? Does previously loaded usage draw from the new plan, and is there a way to trigger this?","response":"When a usage plan is replaced with a new plan (with the same unit of measure) as of the same date, previously loaded usage does not automatically draw from the new plan if the usage was only guided to the subscription and not to a specific charge. There is no standard way to trigger the usage to be re-associated with the new plan; all usage may need to be reloaded to ensure it is drawn from the correct plan. This is a limitation of the current system behavior.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"usage plan replacement and usage association"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected behavior and limitations when processing unit-based PPDD (Prepaid with Drawdown) usage through Mediation, and what are the current gaps for supporting this in the rating pipeline?","response":"The current rating pipeline only supports currency-based PPDD, not unit-based. When processing unit-based PPDD usage through Mediation, errors such as 'RatedAmount is null' may occur because the pipeline expects a rated amount from Mediation. For use cases like Upwork, where only usage consumption in units is tracked (with list price set to $0), the pipeline cannot process the data as required. Enabling the pipeline alone does not solve these use cases, and there are additional gaps such as the need for enhanced rollover period handling and GL string support from Mediation to the pipeline to ACB. The pipeline enablement also requires P&T review and approval, and may be disabled if not a fit for the use case.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"unit-based PPDD mediation and rating pipeline gaps"}

{"instruction":"What is the process for disabling charge level proration for a tenant, and are there any risks or concerns with disabling it?","response":"Charge level proration can be disabled for a tenant, but it should only be done with approval from a product manager. In one case, charge level proration was enabled during order enablement, but the order enablement failed. After enabling order handling (OH) for the tenant, charge level proration was disabled upon customer request. There were no concerns raised about disabling it in this scenario, but it is important to ensure that disabling the feature aligns with customer requirements and does not impact other processes.","category":"procedural","topic":"disabling charge level proration"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected behavior when regenerating an invoice with a new template at the subscription level, and why might the new template not be applied?","response":"When regenerating an invoice, if the invoice template is assigned at the account level and the setting 'Copy billing attributes from accounts to billing documents when no attributes are specified on subscriptions' is set to No, the regenerated invoice will use the new template. However, if the template ID is copied to the invoice (either from the account or subscription), you cannot change the template by simply updating the subscription. In this case, you need to update the Invoice.templateId directly via API for existing invoices. Placing an order to swap the template on the subscription only affects future invoices, not existing ones.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"invoice regeneration and template assignment"}
{"instruction":"What is the relationship between usage, processed usage, and invoice items in Zuora, and how does this help with reconciliation?","response":"In Zuora, the relationship is Usage > Processed Usage > Invoice Item. Each usage record is processed into a processed usage record, which is then linked to the corresponding invoice item. This linkage allows for effective reconciliation, as you can trace invoice items back to the original usage records, even in scenarios involving rollup usage across multiple accounts.","category":"definitional","topic":"usage, processed usage, and invoice item linkage"}
{"instruction":"How can I apply a discount to the delta value during a product upgrade, so that only the difference in price is discounted, rather than the full new product price?","response":"Currently, when upgrading a product (e.g., from Solo to Premium), Zuora credits the full amount of the original product and applies the discount to the full price of the new product, resulting in a larger discount than intended. The desired behavior is to apply the discount only to the price difference (delta) between the two products. There is no out-of-the-box configuration to apply a discount specifically to the delta value during a product upgrade. The system's default behavior is to credit the old product and apply the discount to the new product's full price. As a workaround, you may need to implement custom logic outside of Zuora or adjust the upgrade process to manually calculate and apply the correct discount amount to the invoice, ensuring only the delta is discounted. This is a known limitation and has been raised by other users as well.","category":"procedural","topic":"Product upgrade discount delta"}

{"instruction":"How can I cap usage overage charges and automatically pause billing and services once a customer reaches a predefined overage threshold?","response":"Zuora Billing does not natively support capping usage overage charges and automatically pausing billing or services once a threshold is reached. There is no out-of-the-box feature for partial billing on usage records or for enforcing a hard cap with automatic service suspension. To achieve this, you would need to implement a custom workflow that monitors overage amounts and, upon reaching the threshold, triggers a process to suspend the subscription or pause services. This approach requires using Zuora Workflow or an external automation tool to check usage and manage subscription status accordingly.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Capping usage overage and pausing services"}
{"instruction":"How can I track and report on customers nearing their usage or bandwidth limits in real time, and handle overage billing based on opt-in/opt-out preferences?","response":"To track customers nearing their usage or bandwidth limits in real time, usage should be uploaded and tracked continuously. For monthly billing, usage is evaluated each month; for annual billing, usage accumulates over the year. To notify management when a customer is nearing their limit, you can set up reporting or notifications based on usage thresholds. For handling overage billing based on opt-in/opt-out preferences, you would need to store overage usage in a custom object or hold it in Mediation until the customer's preference is received (e.g., from Salesforce). If the customer opts in, the overage is billed; if not, the service can be paused or the overage written off at the end of the term. This process typically requires custom workflows and integration between Zuora and external systems to manage the opt-in/opt-out logic and ensure accurate billing and service management.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Real-time usage tracking and overage opt-in management"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to support suspend/resume actions for prepaid (PPDD) subscriptions, especially as part of a dunning flow?","response":"Currently, suspend/resume actions are not supported for prepaid with drawdown (PPDD) charges. If you attempt to suspend or resume a subscription containing PPDD charges, you will encounter an error stating that this action is not allowed. This limitation is documented, and there is no immediate plan to add support for suspend/resume on PPDD charges. As a workaround, you can consider moving the customer to a non-billable batch to stop billing, but this does not prevent upgrades or downgrades. To fully block changes during dunning, you may need to implement custom logic or validations based on subscription and account status.","category":"definitional","topic":"Suspend/resume support for PPDD subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How can I monitor overage amounts and ratios for prepaid balance (PPDD) charges, especially for currency-based models with multiple drawdown charges and annual validity periods?","response":"For both unit-based and currency-based PPDD, you can monitor overage amounts by checking the unbilled usage section on the usage charge before billing. This section provides the overage amount for the period. After billing, overage can be seen directly on the invoice. You can also query the RatingResult object, which includes overage information both before and after billing. However, if there are multiple drawdown charges and annual validity periods, you will need to aggregate the data from the unbilled usage or RatingResult objects to calculate the total overage and overage ratio across all relevant charges and periods. This may require custom reporting or data processing to achieve the desired summary.","category":"procedural","topic":"Monitoring PPDD overage amounts and ratios"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to have a single prepaid charge that can be used across multiple subscriptions, and what is the current roadmap for this feature?","response":"Currently, Zuora does not support a single prepaid charge being used across multiple subscriptions out of the box. However, there is a roadmap item to add this capability, with work expected to begin in CY26 Q1, though there is no firm commitment yet. As a partial workaround, the \"Roll Up Child Usage\" feature can be used with Prepaid with Drawdown (PPDD), allowing usage from child accounts to be rolled up and drawn down from a single prepayment balance. This approach is already used by some customers, but true multi-subscription drawdown from a single prepayment is not yet available. Customers with this requirement should monitor the roadmap and consider interim solutions such as using rollup features or custom mediation logic.","category":"definitional","topic":"Account-level prepaid drawdown across subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How can I tie usage records to invoice items or charges generated from that usage, especially in scenarios involving rollup usage across parent-child accounts?","response":"The linkage between usage records and invoice items is established through the Processed Usage object. The typical relationship is Usage > Processed Usage > Invoice Item. This linkage works even in rollup usage scenarios, where a single usage record may be billed and invoiced across multiple accounts in a parent-child relationship. Each invoice item can be traced back to the processed usage records that contributed to its calculation. Note that a single charge or invoice item is typically linked with multiple usage records, not just one. To perform reconciliation or traceability, use the Processed Usage object as the connecting point between raw usage and invoiced charges.","category":"procedural","topic":"Usage-to-invoice item linkage and reconciliation"}
{"instruction":"What is the logic behind how Zuora splits up usage charge items in invoices for a usage charge with Drawdown + Credit Commitment, and why might the quantity split appear incorrect?","response":"For usage charges with Drawdown + Credit Commitment, Zuora splits the invoice line items based on the amount percentage. The system uses the formula: (amount for the period / total amount) * total quantity to determine the split quantity for each line item. This can result in quantities that do not exactly match the expected minimum commitment or overage quantities, especially when currency-based calculations are involved. The displayed quantity may include additional units due to the proportional split, even if the total amount is correct. This behavior is by design, but it can lead to confusion if the split quantities do not align precisely with the original commitment or usage records.","category":"definitional","topic":"Usage charge quantity split logic for Drawdown + Credit Commitment"}
{"instruction":"How does Zuora determine which prepaid charge or top-up to draw down from first when multiple are created on the same day? Is the drawdown always FIFO based on creation order?","response":"When multiple prepaid charges or top-ups are created on the same day with the same unit of measure (UOM) and no rollover, Zuora will draw down from the charge that was created earlier in the database. The system uses a FIFO (first-in, first-out) approach based on the creation timestamp of the records. This ensures that the original prepaid charge is depleted before the system begins to draw down from any subsequent top-ups created on the same day.","category":"definitional","topic":"PPDD drawdown order with multiple charges or top-ups"}
{"instruction":"What are the current limitations and roadmap plans for supporting recurring, one-time, and OLI charges as drawdown of prepaid balances?","response":"Currently, Prepaid with Drawdown (PPDD) primarily supports usage charges for drawdown. There is ongoing work to extend drawdown support to recurring charges (RC), one-time charges (OTC), and order line items (OLI). The main concern with supporting recurring charges as drawdown is the complexity of revenue recognition, since drawdown is 'in advance' but revenue recognition may need to be handled differently. The roadmap includes plans to add support for these additional charge types, with recurring charge drawdown being a more complex scenario due to revenue policy implications. Customers interested in these features should provide detailed use cases to help inform the design and prioritization of these enhancements.","category":"definitional","topic":"Drawdown support for recurring, one-time, and OLI charges"}
{"instruction":"How can I apply a discount to usage charges that are drawdown currency-based, and what are the current limitations?","response":"Discount charges can be used with currency-based Prepaid with Drawdown (PPDD) to discount usage charge amounts prior to drawdown. This functionality is supported and works end-to-end, including for order-to-revenue (OTR) scenarios. However, there may be limitations depending on the specific charge models and configurations in use. For example, applying a discount to a minimum commitment amount is not currently defined and can be a tricky scenario. If the discount is applied purely to the usage charge, it is supported. For more complex discounting scenarios, such as stacked discounts or discounts on minimum commitment, further clarification and potential enhancements may be needed.","category":"definitional","topic":"Discounting currency-based PPDD usage charges"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling delayed usage uploads in a prepaid usage-based billing model, especially when the bill run needs to occur after all usage is uploaded?","response":"Best practice is to ensure that the usage transaction date reflects the actual date of usage, not the upload date. When running the bill on a later date (e.g., the 3rd of the month), configure the bill run to pick up only usage records with transaction dates within the previous billing period. This ensures that delayed uploads are included in the correct billing cycle, and no usage from the new month is inadvertently billed in the prior month's invoice. Always verify that the transaction date is set correctly during the upload process.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Handling delayed usage uploads in prepaid billing"}
{"instruction":"How can I exclude certain usage records from billing, so that only selected usage is invoiced?","response":"Zuora does not provide a direct field or flag to mark individual usage records as 'no-bill' or to exclude them from billing. As a workaround, you can update the StartDate of the usage record to a future date (e.g., 2099), which will prevent it from being picked up in the current bill run. When you want to include the usage in billing, you can update the StartDate back to the original value. Note that this approach may have implications for re-rating and late usage scenarios, especially with Advanced Consumption Billing (ACB). The use case for loading data but not billing it should be carefully considered, as it may impact reporting and billing logic.","category":"procedural","topic":"Excluding usage records from billing"}
{"instruction":"What are the current limitations and plans for supporting negative usage (negative quantity usage) in Zuora, and how does it interact with other features like Unique Key?","response":"Negative Quantity Usage is currently in Beta and enabled on all sandboxes. However, it is not fully compatible with the Unique Key feature. When both are enabled, estimates for fund usage and unbilled usage, as well as threshold notifications, may be incorrect in sandboxes, though these are corrected upon billing. This issue has been confirmed by Engineering, and there is ongoing discussion about whether to disable the feature or fix the incompatibility. Users should be aware of these limitations when testing or using negative usage in conjunction with Unique Key.","category":"definitional","topic":"Negative usage and Unique Key compatibility"}
{"instruction":"How can I achieve non-blended breakdown of tiered rating charges on an invoice, so that the quantity per tier is shown for the billing period?","response":"By default, Zuora provides a single line with a blended rate for all tiers used in a tiered rating charge, rather than separate lines for each tier. There is no standard configuration to automatically break down the quantity per tier on the invoice. To achieve a non-blended breakdown, you may need to implement custom reporting or use data queries to extract and present the tiered quantities and rates for each billing period. This is a known limitation, and customers requiring detailed tier breakdowns should consider custom solutions.","category":"procedural","topic":"Non-blended tiered rating breakdown on invoices"}
{"instruction":"How does the Bill Run Advanced Filter work, and what are its current limitations regarding the number of subscriptions or conditions that can be included?","response":"The Bill Run Advanced Filter allows users to filter bill runs based on specific criteria, such as subscription numbers. Each condition group can include a maximum of 10 conditions, and you can create up to two layers of conditions or condition groups for each filter. If you use OR to select subscription numbers, the limit is 10. There is also a documented limitation that all subscriptions must belong to the same account if you want to include up to 50 subscriptions. If you need to bill more than 10 subscriptions across different accounts, you may need to create multiple bill runs or use account-level filters to improve performance. Increasing the limit beyond 10 for subscriptions belonging to different accounts is not currently supported, and any changes would require a business use case to be submitted for consideration.","category":"definitional","topic":"Bill Run Advanced Filter limitations"}

However, there is an enhancement that allows you to update the Invoice.templateId via API for existing invoices. To update the template, use the following API call: PUT /v1/invoices/{invoiceId} with the new templateId.

{"instruction":"How can I apply a discount to the delta value during a product upgrade, so that only the difference in price is discounted, rather than the full new product price?","response":"Currently, when upgrading a product (e.g., from Solo to Premium), Zuora credits the full amount of the original product and applies the discount to the full price of the new product, resulting in a larger discount than intended. The desired behavior is to apply the discount only to the price difference (delta) between the two products. There is no out-of-the-box configuration to apply a discount specifically to the delta value during a product upgrade. The system's default behavior is to credit the old product and apply the discount to the new product's full price.

{"instruction":"Is it possible to trigger custom logic only on creation or only on update of an object, and how does this work in functions versus decision tables/trees?","response":"Previously, there was an option in custom functions to trigger logic only on create or only on update, but this setting was removed because it did not work properly. Currently, custom logic (including functions, decision tables, and decision trees) is always triggered on both creation and update events. The system cannot distinguish between the two at this time, so the logic is hookpoint agnostic. If you need to ensure a function only runs on creation (for example, generating a UUID only once), you may need to add logic within your function to check if the field is already populated and only generate a value if it is empty.

{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling Custom Logic in production, and are there any requirements or steps to follow?","response":"To enable Custom Logic in production, you need to provide a business use case for the enablement request. The process typically involves posting the request (with use case) in the support channel or submitting a support ticket. After T9 permissions are enabled, an additional step is required for engineering to provision the feature, usually via a Jenkins job. For sandboxes, approval is generally not required, and the feature may be enabled by default. There is no additional licensing cost for enabling Custom Logic in production.","category":"procedural","topic":"custom logic production enablement"}
{"instruction":"How can I troubleshoot when a newly created custom field does not appear in the Custom Logic UI or in decision tables?","response":"If a newly created custom field does not appear in the Custom Logic UI or in decision tables, it may be due to a metadata refresh issue. Sometimes, the custom field is not present in the ruleset metadata, which can require a backend refresh. This issue has been observed and can often be resolved by refreshing the metadata from the backend. If the problem persists, you should log a support ticket (L3) for further investigation.

{"instruction":"Can custom logic be used to update the 'IsInvoiceSeparate' field on a subscription, and what are the requirements for mutating standard fields?","response":"Currently, custom logic does not allow mutations for the 'IsInvoiceSeparate' field on the subscription object. Mutability of standard fields is restricted and must be vetted by the application team before being allowed. If you have a customer use case that requires updating this field, you should confirm with the Invoice team that such updates will not impact pre-defined invoice logic or integrations. If approved, mutability support for the field can be added to the backlog.

{"instruction":"How can I update multiple account properties using custom logic, and what are common pitfalls when referencing fields?","response":"You can use custom logic functions to update multiple account properties based on other account properties. For example, you can use JavaScript to map and assign values to fields like PaymentTerm, BcdSettingOption, Batch, and TaxExemptStatus. A common pitfall is referencing fields using the wrong API names or case sensitivity. For instance, using 'paymentTerm' instead of 'PaymentTerm' may cause the update to fail. Always verify that the fields are referenced accurately and exist as standard or custom fields. Testing in a sandbox environment is recommended before deploying to production.

{"instruction":"How can I resolve issues where picklist values or custom fields are missing from the Custom Logic UI?","response":"If picklist values or custom fields are missing from the Custom Logic UI, it is often due to metadata not being refreshed. This can be resolved by refreshing the metadata from the backend. If the issue persists, file a support ticket (L3) for the custom logic team to investigate.

In the meantime, manual metadata refresh is the recommended workaround.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"missing picklist values or custom fields in custom logic"}
{"instruction":"Is there a delay before a newly created custom field appears in the Custom Logic UI?","response":"There is not an expected delay before a newly created custom field appears in the Custom Logic UI. However, in some cases, users have observed a delay of about 10 minutes, which may be due to the time taken for the custom field creation process itself to complete in the database. Once the custom field is created and the job status is 'Completed,' it should appear in the Custom Logic UI almost immediately. If a significant delay occurs after confirming the field is created, it may indicate an issue with the custom field table population.","category":"definitional","topic":"custom field appearance delay in custom logic UI"}
{"instruction":"Can I use custom logic to update an Account field based on a Subscription Rate Plan's ProductRatePlanId, and are there any issues with batch aliases in decision tables?","response":"Yes, you can use custom logic (such as a decision tree) to update an Account field based on the ProductRatePlanId of a Subscription Rate Plan. However, when setting the batch via a decision tree, the dropdown may show the Batch with its alias (e.g., 'Batch5 (B2C Ireland)'), which can cause the logic to fail if batch aliases are configured. The correct value to set is the underlying batch name or alias, not the display value. If the dropdown does not refresh after removing an alias, it may be due to caching in the UI or backend. As a workaround, you can update the rule by API with the proper value, and after some time, the dropdown should refresh correctly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"account field update via subscription rate plan and batch alias issues"}
{"instruction":"How does custom logic interact with notifications, specifically regarding the order of execution?","response":"Custom Logic is applied before standard notifications are sent out. For example, if you have a custom logic function that triggers on subscription creation and a standard notification (such as '1210 - Subscription Created'), the custom logic will execute and update fields before the notification is triggered. This ensures that any changes made by custom logic are reflected in the notification payload.","category":"definitional","topic":"custom logic and notification order of execution"}
{"instruction":"Can I use custom logic to copy a custom field from the invoice object to the payment object when there is a 1:1 relationship?","response":"Copying a custom field from the invoice object to the payment object using custom logic is only supported for nested objects with pre-defined relationships in the data model. In cases where the relationship is not nested (even if it is 1:1), this is not supported by custom logic. Workflow is recommended as a better alternative for this scenario.","category":"definitional","topic":"copying fields between objects with custom logic"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to set a date custom field to the current date ('today') dynamically in a decision tree?","response":"It is not possible to dynamically set a date custom field to the current date ('today') in a decision tree.

{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling Custom Logic for a tenant, and what are the steps if objects are not visible after enablement?","response":"Enabling Custom Logic for a tenant is a two-step process: first, the provision team enables the T9 permission, and then the engineering team runs a Jenkins job to provision the objects. Both steps are required after PM approval. If, after enablement, the object list is empty in the Custom Logic UI, it usually means the Jenkins job was not run. Triggering the job should resolve the issue and make the objects visible.","category":"procedural","topic":"custom logic enablement and object visibility"}
{"instruction":"Can custom logic be used to update fields on the Payment object using decision trees, and where can I find the list of supported fields?","response":"Not all fields on the Payment object are supported for updates via decision trees in custom logic. If you are unable to update certain Payment fields in the Result section, it may be due to current limitations.

{"instruction":"How can I update a custom field on one Rate Plan Charge based on another Rate Plan Charge within the same subscription using custom logic?","response":"Custom logic does not support referencing or updating the same custom field across different Rate Plan Charges within the same subscription. The logic is created at the field definition level and traverses all records, so it cannot reference the value of a custom field on another Rate Plan Charge. You can define different values for the field when building the logic, or use another dedicated field for reference, but direct cross-record updates are not supported.","category":"definitional","topic":"cross-rate plan charge field updates in custom logic"}
{"instruction":"Is there an audit trail for Custom Logic, and how can I identify when a user last made changes?","response":"There is an audit trail for Custom Logic, but it needs to be enabled under Manage Audit Trail Settings. It is not enabled by default. Once enabled, you can identify when a user last made changes and what those changes were. If the audit trail is not enabled, this information will not be available.","category":"definitional","topic":"custom logic audit trail"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected behavior when a customer loses access to Custom Logic after a CSBX refresh, and how can it be restored?","response":"After a CSBX (Central Sandbox) refresh, it is expected that a customer will lose access to Custom Logic, as the refresh removes the custom logic definitions. To restore access, ensure that T9 permissions are enabled, then raise a support ticket for the data team to re-enable Custom Logic via the pipeline. You do not need to specify the type of Custom Logic; previous enablements are not required for reference.","category":"procedural","topic":"custom logic access after CSBX refresh"}
{"instruction":"Can I use custom logic to update an Account field based on the value of a Subscription Rate Plan's ProductRatePlanId, and what issues might arise with batch aliases?","response":"Yes, you can use custom logic (such as a decision tree) to update an Account field based on the ProductRatePlanId of a Subscription Rate Plan. However, when setting the batch via a decision tree, the dropdown may show the Batch with its alias (e.g., 'Batch5 (B2C Ireland)'), which can cause the logic to fail if batch aliases are configured. The correct value to set is the underlying batch name or alias, not the display value. If the dropdown does not refresh after removing an alias, it may be due to caching in the UI or backend. As a workaround, you can update the rule by API with the proper value, and after some time, the dropdown should refresh correctly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"account field update via subscription rate plan and batch alias issues"}
{"instruction":"How can I update multiple account properties using custom logic, and what are common pitfalls when referencing fields?","response":"You can use custom logic functions to update multiple account properties based on other account properties. For example, you can use JavaScript to map and assign values to fields like PaymentTerm, BcdSettingOption, Batch, and TaxExemptStatus. A common pitfall is referencing fields using the wrong API names or case sensitivity. For instance, using 'paymentTerm' instead of 'PaymentTerm' may cause the update to fail. Always verify that the fields are referenced accurately and exist as standard or custom fields. Testing in a sandbox environment is recommended before deploying to production. Performance overhead is expected, but report any abnormally high latency or runtime issues.","category":"best_practice","topic":"updating multiple account properties with custom logic"}
{"instruction":"What should I do if custom logic is not triggering for a specific country or scenario, even though the rule works for others?","response":"If custom logic is not triggering for a specific country or scenario (e.g., 'South Korea'), but works for others, first verify that the rule is active, the country name is spelled correctly in Admin Settings, and there are no issues in the migration file. If all these are correct, the next step is to raise a Jira ticket so that logs can be checked for further troubleshooting. This approach helps identify if there is a system bug or a configuration issue specific to that scenario.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"custom logic not triggering for specific scenario"}
{"instruction":"How can I update a custom field on a Zuora object (e.g., Account, Subscription, Payment) using Custom Logic, and what are the limitations on which fields can be updated?","response":"To update a custom field on a Zuora object using Custom Logic, you can use Decision Tables, Decision Trees, or JS-based Custom Functions. The logic is triggered on object creation or update, and you can specify the field(s) to update in the result/output section of your logic. However, not all fields are updatable via Custom Logic. Only fields that are explicitly supported as mutable can be set in the result. For example, some standard fields like Account.Batch or Subscription.InvoiceGroupNumber may not be updatable directly and may require specific order actions or are restricted for data integrity reasons. The list of updatable fields is documented in the Knowledge Center, and if a field is not available in the result dropdown, it cannot be updated via Custom Logic. If you need to update a field that is not currently supported, you may need to request an enhancement or use an alternative approach such as Workflow.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"How do I enable Custom Logic for a tenant in production or sandbox environments?","response":"To enable Custom Logic for a tenant, the process depends on the environment. For API Sandboxes, Custom Logic is generally enabled by default. For Production or Central Sandbox environments, enablement requires Product Management (PM) approval. The typical process involves raising a support ticket (often referred to as an L3 or ZRE ticket) with details about the tenant and the use case. Once approved, the provisioning or engineering team will enable the feature, sometimes using a Jenkins job to ensure all necessary permissions and objects are provisioned. It's important not to enable only the T9 permission manually, as this may not fully provision the required objects for Custom Logic. Always follow the official enablement process to avoid configuration issues.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"What should I do if I cannot see standard or custom objects in the Decision Table or Decision Tree object dropdown when creating Custom Logic?","response":"If you cannot see standard or custom objects in the object dropdown for Decision Table or Decision Tree, it may be due to incomplete provisioning. This often happens if only the T9 permission was enabled without running the required Jenkins job that provisions the objects for Custom Logic. To resolve this, request that the provisioning or engineering team rerun the Jenkins job for your tenant. If the issue persists, collect a HAR file and raise a support ticket (L3) under the ZRE project for further investigation. Avoid enabling T9 directly without PM approval and the full provisioning process.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"Can Custom Logic in Zuora reference or update fields across different objects (e.g., update Subscription fields based on changes in Account or custom objects)?","response":"Custom Logic in Zuora is object-centric and triggers only on mutations (create or update) of the base object for which the logic is defined. While you can access some related objects' fields (e.g., from Subscription you can access Account fields), you cannot trigger logic on one object and update unrelated objects. For example, updating a Subscription field when an Account field changes is not supported; you would need to update the Subscription record itself to trigger the logic. Similarly, lookups or queries across unrelated custom objects are not supported. For more complex cross-object automation, consider using Workflow or asynchronous event triggers.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"How can I debug issues with Custom Logic not firing or not updating fields as expected?","response":"To debug issues with Custom Logic not firing or not updating fields, follow these steps: 1) Ensure the logic is active and correctly configured for the intended object and trigger (create/update). 2) Check that only one active logic of each type (Decision Table, Decision Tree, Function) exists per object, as multiple active logics are not supported. 3) Verify that the fields you are trying to update are supported for mutation in Custom Logic. 4) Use the test feature in the Custom Logic UI to simulate input and check outputs. 5) If the issue persists, collect logs (e.g., from Kibana for SBX/PROD) and a HAR file, and raise a support ticket with detailed reproduction steps. Sometimes, configuration issues in the environment may require engineering intervention or a system restart.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to compare old and new values of a field in Custom Logic to implement validations based on changes?","response":"No, Custom Logic does not currently support comparing old and new values of a field within its logic. There is no concept of 'old' and 'new' value comparison as found in event triggers or custom events. You can only validate the current value of a field, not whether it has changed from a previous value. For requirements that depend on detecting changes (e.g., preventing updates to a field unless certain conditions are met), you may need to use asynchronous triggers, audit trail, or Workflow for post-update validation and restoration.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"What are the performance considerations when using Custom Logic, especially for high-volume operations like payment runs?","response":"Custom Logic is executed synchronously as part of the pre-commit process for object creation or update. This means that for high-volume operations, such as payment runs that process hundreds of thousands of records, adding Custom Logic can impact performance. Each record's database operation will wait for the logic to execute before proceeding, potentially increasing the overall processing time. For example, a payment run that already takes many hours could be further slowed if Custom Logic is applied to each payment. It's important to test and evaluate the performance impact in your environment before deploying Custom Logic to high-volume processes.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"How are changes made by Custom Logic tracked in Zuora's audit trail?","response":"Field value changes made by Custom Logic are logged in the audit trail for all audit-enabled objects, such as Account. The audit trail will show the username of the user who performed the record update, even if the change was triggered by Custom Logic. However, the audit trail does not indicate that the update was specifically made by Custom Logic. There is a separate audit log for Custom Logic definitions themselves, but this does not include field-level changes. An enhancement to record the reason for field updates (e.g., 'updated via Custom Logic') is not currently on the roadmap, but requirements can be submitted for future consideration.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"Can I use Custom Logic to perform lookups or queries on unrelated objects or custom objects in Zuora?","response":"No, Custom Logic does not support performing lookups or queries on unrelated objects or custom objects. The logic can only access a limited set of related objects as defined by the object model (e.g., from Account you can access BillToContact, SoldToContact, etc.). Hard-coded lookups within the logic are possible for a small set of values, but dynamic querying of unrelated or custom objects is not supported. For scenarios requiring such lookups, consider using Workflow or other integration solutions.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit to the number of active Custom Logic rules per object, and can I have multiple active rules of the same type?","response":"Currently, only one active logic of each type (Decision Table, Decision Tree, Function) is allowed per object. Attempting to create multiple active rules of the same type for a single object will result in an error. This limitation is in place to avoid conflicts and undefined behavior regarding rule execution order. If you need to change logic, deactivate the existing rule before activating a new one.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"How can I update a date field in Custom Logic, and what format should I use?","response":"When updating a date field in Custom Logic, ensure that the value assigned is in the correct format expected by Zuora (typically 'YYYY-MM-DD'). If you use JavaScript's Date object, convert it to the appropriate string format before assigning it to the field. For example, use newrenewaldate.toISOString().split('T')[0] to get the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. Assigning a raw Date object may result in the field not being updated as expected.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"What should I do if a field I want to update is not available in the result dropdown of a Decision Table or Decision Tree?","response":"If a field is not available in the result dropdown, it means that field is not currently supported for updates via Custom Logic. Only fields explicitly allowed as mutable can be set in the result. If you have a business need to update such a field, provide feedback to Product Management or raise a support ticket to request an enhancement. In the meantime, consider alternative approaches such as using Workflow or manual updates.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"How do I enable or troubleshoot Custom Logic in Central Sandbox (CSBX) environments?","response":"Custom Logic is not always enabled by default in Central Sandbox (CSBX) environments. Enablement requires PM approval and may be subject to rollout schedules. If you need Custom Logic in CSBX, provide your use case and tenant ID to the product team for consideration. Do not attempt to enable it manually, as this may not provision all required components. If you encounter issues, such as missing objects in the dropdown, request that the provisioning team rerun the necessary jobs and raise a support ticket if the problem persists.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"Can I use Custom Logic to update fields in Japanese or other non-English languages?","response":"Currently, there are limitations in overwriting values in Japanese (and potentially other non-English languages) through Custom Logic. Support for non-English values may not be fully implemented, and there is no confirmed timeline for when this will be supported. If you encounter this limitation, raise a support ticket and monitor product updates for future enhancements.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"How can I update a custom field on the Invoice object with a value from a related Subscription or Order Line Item using Custom Logic?","response":"Custom Logic does not support cross-object updates where you update a field on the Invoice object with a value from a related Subscription or Order Line Item. The logic can only access fields on the base object and a limited set of directly related objects. For more complex scenarios, such as copying a value from a Subscription to an Invoice, use Workflow or event triggers that can handle cross-object data manipulation asynchronously.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to delete a Decision Table or Decision Tree in Custom Logic, or can I only activate/deactivate them?","response":"Currently, Decision Tables and Decision Trees in Custom Logic can only be activated or deactivated; there is no option to delete them. This is a known limitation and may be addressed in future product updates. For now, deactivate any logic you no longer wish to use.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"How do I handle errors or validation messages in Custom Logic, and can I define custom error codes for API responses?","response":"In Custom Logic, you can define the status and response fields for error handling. For example, you can set a custom error message in the result/output when a validation fails. The error message defined in your logic will be returned in the API response. However, there is currently no support for reserving custom error code ranges for tenant-specific validation rules. For more sophisticated error handling and operational troubleshooting, consider documenting your validation rules and error messages for support teams.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for raising a support or engineering ticket for issues with Custom Logic?","response":"If you encounter issues with Custom Logic, such as missing objects, logic not firing, or unexpected behavior, collect relevant information (e.g., HAR file, tenant ID, reproduction steps) and raise a support ticket, often referred to as an L3 or ZRE ticket. Provide as much detail as possible, including environment, object, and logic configuration. The support team may escalate to engineering if needed. For feature requests or enhancements, submit requirements to Product Management or log a CET ticket in Jira.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"Can I use Custom Logic to update the due date on Debit Memos, and why might this not be possible?","response":"Currently, the due date on Debit Memos is not mutable via Custom Logic because it flows from the Invoice and does not have a separate date. While the API may allow updating the due date, Custom Logic restricts this field for data integrity reasons. If there is no technical reason to prevent mutation and the field is mutable via API, a ticket can be raised to request support for this in Custom Logic.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"How do I update a custom field with the value of another field in Custom Logic, and are there any restrictions?","response":"In Custom Logic, you can update a custom field with the value of another field using a Function. However, in Decision Tables and Decision Trees, the 'Result' currently only supports constants, not dynamic field references. If you need to copy the value of one field to another, use a Function and reference the source field in your logic. This limitation may be addressed in future updates.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom-logic-support"}
{"instruction":"What should I do if Custom Logic is not available in my environment or tenant?","response":"If Custom Logic is not available in your environment (e.g., Central Sandbox, Production), it may be due to rollout schedules or the need for PM approval.

If no organizations have been created in the tenant, you can turn off the T9 switch, which will effectively disable MO. However, the Tenant Hub (THB) entitlement table will still show MO as enabled, which ideally should be cleaned up by the THB team to avoid issues if MO is provisioned again in the future. If you do not want to go through the full de-provisioning process, you can simply re-enable T9 when needed, and no further action is required from the THB team. If organizations have already been created, you may need to delete them from both the Tenant Hub and billing databases for a full reversal. Always confirm the customer's requirements and check for any existing orgs before proceeding. Note that disabling MO may have downstream impacts, and the process may require coordination with engineering if technical issues arise.","category":"procedural","topic":"disabling multi-org"}
{"instruction":"Can the Data Labeling API be used to update organization labels on existing records for all supported objects, and are there any limitations?","response":"The Data Labeling API can be used to update organization labels on existing records for supported objects. For Customer Accounts and Products, the API works as expected and updates are reflected in the UI. However, for the User object, while the API may return success, the change might not appear in the Zuora UI, indicating a possible limitation in UI support for this object. It is recommended to confirm the current support status for each object and be aware that UI reflection may not be consistent across all object types.","category":"definitional","topic":"data labeling API limitations"}
{"instruction":"Are there any limitations with using custom fields on accounting periods in Multi-Org, and what issues might arise?","response":"There is a known issue when a custom field is created on the Accounting Periods object and that field is either required or lacks a default value. In such cases, Multi-Org may not work properly. This issue is not exclusive to Multi-Org; it would impact the system regardless of MO status. The problem was logged as a bug, and it is unclear how the accounting period was allowed to be created under these conditions. Users should be cautious when configuring required custom fields without default values on accounting periods in a Multi-Org environment.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"custom field limitations on accounting periods"}
{"instruction":"In a Multi-Org setup with Zuora CPQ integration, is it possible to prevent product data from syncing to Salesforce for a business unit that does not use CPQ?","response":"No, in a Multi-Org setup, all organizations and all products will be synced to Salesforce. There is no out-of-the-box way to prevent product data from syncing for a specific business unit that does not use Zuora CPQ. To avoid users selecting the second org in a quote, you would need to implement additional logic or controls outside of the standard sync process.","category":"definitional","topic":"product data sync with Salesforce"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and escalation steps for restructuring a Multi-Org hierarchy when no data or users are tagged?","response":"If a customer needs to delete an existing Multi-Org hierarchy and set up a new one, and there are no transactions or users tagged to the current structure, the recommended best practice is to raise a support ticket and assign it to the Tenant Hub team. Internal and customer-facing documentation covers these steps. If the support ticket is not progressing, escalate it to the engineering team, especially if the customer is in a critical phase such as go-live. Timely escalation is important to avoid project delays.","category":"best_practice","topic":"multi-org hierarchy restructuring"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to enable both Multi-Entity (ME) and Multi-Org (MO) for the same tenant, and what are the constraints?","response":"ME and MO cannot be enabled together for the same tenant due to a validation in place that prevents this configuration. If a tenant already has ME enabled, MO cannot be enabled, and vice versa. If you need to test MO scenarios, use a tenant that does not have ME enabled. Additionally, CPQ does not support MO and ME as a combined solution. If both are required, further clarification of the use case is necessary, and a meeting with stakeholders may be needed to discuss alternatives.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi-entity and multi-org compatibility"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the SKU for products in a Multi-Org tenant, and what methods are supported?","response":"To update the SKU for products in a Multi-Org enabled Zuora Billing tenant, you can use the UI or the Data Loader with the Update Product template. The only requirement is that the tenant must have Multi-Org enabled. If you encounter errors when updating the SKU using Data Loader, Dev Tools, or API, ensure that the tenant configuration is correct and that you are following the supported process. If issues persist, replicate the scenario in a test tenant and escalate to support if necessary.","category":"procedural","topic":"updating product SKU in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for configuring separate payment GL accounts for each organization in Multi-Org, and are there any out-of-the-box solutions?","response":"Multi-Org does not provide out-of-the-box granularity for tenant configurations in Finance, Billing, Payments, or Commerce. To configure separate payment GL accounts for each organization, you would need to use a workflow to update the accounting code on each payment based on the org. Alternatively, you could implement logic in the summary GL connector (e.g., using liquid code) before sending data to external systems like NetSuite. There is no current feature to handle this requirement natively, but there is ongoing discussion about potential enhancements such as multi-dimensional GL segmentation. For now, customization is required.","category":"best_practice","topic":"separate GL accounts per org"}
{"instruction":"How does the Exchange Rate Set feature work in Multi-Org, and when should it be used?","response":"The Exchange Rate Set feature is used when you need different sets of FX rates for different organizations within your Multi-Org hierarchy. When implemented, it introduces a new field called 'ratesetname' in the fxcustomrate object. In the currency conversion settings, you can select a custom exchange rate provider and create or select a rate set for specific orgs. This allows, for example, Org 1 and 2 to use Rate Set A, while Org 3 uses Rate Set B. When uploading new rates, you must specify the rate set, and this becomes mandatory once rate sets are enabled. After setup, transaction-level exchange rates will reference the org-specific rates. This feature is especially useful when different orgs use different exchange rate providers.","category":"definitional","topic":"exchange rate set in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to delete organizations created by mistake in a sandbox tenant, or update their currency?","response":"It is not possible to delete organizations created by mistake in a sandbox tenant. However, you can update the currency of an organization using a private API. The API endpoint is '/tenant-registry/info/updateOrganization', and you need to provide the organization ID and the new currency in the request body. This allows you to correct the currency for an existing org, but deletion is not supported.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"deleting or updating orgs in sandbox"}
{"instruction":"Does Multi-Org support custom objects with org-level access or visibility, and is this on the roadmap?","response":"Currently, Multi-Org does not support custom objects (CO) with org-level access or visibility; custom objects are defined at the tenant level and can be seen by all orgs. There is no confirmed plan to add org-level support for custom objects in the near future, though the topic is under internal discussion. Customers requiring this feature should provide use cases to help prioritize future enhancements.","category":"definitional","topic":"custom object support in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"Can you unlabel accounts in Multi-Org, and what are the current limitations or workarounds?","response":"Currently, it is not supported to unlabel accounts in Multi-Org. Attempts to do so will result in an error. The only shareable account is an unlabeled one, so if you need to have accounts shared across orgs, they must remain unlabeled from the start. If you have a hierarchy where mid-level accounts need to be shared, those accounts must also be unlabeled. There is an identified gap in the product, and engineering involvement is required for any unlabeling requests. Customers facing this blocker should escalate through support channels.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"unlabeling accounts in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How does currency conversion and FX Gain/Loss reporting work in Multi-Org, and are there any limitations?","response":"Multi-Org supports currency conversion at a granular org level. FX Gain/Loss is supported in both Finance Journal Run and Trial Balance reporting features within Multi-Org. There was a previous limitation regarding FX Gain/Loss in reporting, but it is now confirmed to be supported in these key reporting areas. Users should specify which reporting feature they are referring to if they encounter issues.","category":"definitional","topic":"currency conversion and FX gain/loss in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How and when is an Exchange Rate Set configured in Multi-Org, and what changes once it is applied?","response":"An Exchange Rate Set is configured when you need to use custom FX rates for different orgs within your hierarchy. Once implemented, a new field 'ratesetname' is added to the fxcustomrate object. In the currency conversion settings, you can select a custom exchange rate provider and assign a rate set to specific orgs. This allows different orgs to use different sets of exchange rates. After rate sets are created and used, transaction-level exchange rates will reference the org-specific rates. When uploading new rates, you must specify the rate set, and this becomes mandatory once rate sets are enabled. There is no difference in how normal exchange rate uploads work versus uploads using a rate set, except for the requirement to specify the rate set.","category":"definitional","topic":"exchange rate set configuration"}
{"instruction":"Is there a public API to retrieve the list of all organizations configured in a Multi-Org tenant?","response":"There is currently no public API to retrieve the list of all organizations configured in a Multi-Org tenant. An internal/private API exists for this purpose, which is used by the org hierarchy management UI. If you have a requirement for a public API, it should be communicated to the product team for consideration.","category":"definitional","topic":"API for retrieving org list"}
{"instruction":"Can you bulk update the MO label for existing accounting periods, and what are the available methods?","response":"Currently, neither Data Loader nor the Action API supports bulk updating the MO label for existing accounting periods. The only available method is to update them individually via the UI. If you need to update more than 50 at once, there is no supported bulk update method at this time.","category":"procedural","topic":"bulk updating MO label on accounting periods"}
{"instruction":"Does the summary GL connector work with Multi-Org, and what does it send to create journal runs?","response":"The available information does not provide a definitive answer regarding the compatibility of the summary GL connector with Multi-Org or the specifics of what it sends to create journal runs. Further investigation or direct confirmation from the product or engineering team is recommended.","category":"definitional","topic":"summary GL connector with multi-org"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to have different SMTP server setups or email domains per org in Multi-Org, and what are the alternatives?","response":"Multi-Org generally does not allow for org-specific settings such as SMTP server setup or email domains, except for a few things like financial currency. Multi-Org is primarily a segment-based access control solution. If you need multiple domains within a single tenant, it is possible, but you must request support to coordinate with engineering. Differentiated emails and communication profiles would require custom logic and mapping. For more granular control, Multi-Entity (ME) may be more suitable, as it supports org-specific configurations.","category":"comparison","topic":"SMTP/email domain per org in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What are the possible scenarios and considerations for using a hybrid model of Multi-Entity (ME) and Multi-Org (MO), and what are the gotchas?","response":"A hybrid model, where you enable MO on a leaf ME entity, is potentially supported. MO was initially considered a successor to ME, but they can be complementary. ME is preferable when you need to separate API limits between entities, while MO is more about segment-based access control. When rolling out a hybrid model, consider that orgs in a single instance do not equate to separate revenue instances. You can phase in entities over time, but be aware of mapping complexities and any limitations in how orgs and entities interact, especially with downstream systems like Zuora Revenue. Adding more entities piecemeal is possible, but plan for gradual rollout and integration challenges.","category":"comparison","topic":"hybrid ME and MO model"}
{"instruction":"How do you configure settings such as SKU format and tax engine in Multi-Org, and at what level are these settings applied?","response":"SKU format and tax engine settings are available at the tenant level but can be configured at the org level in Multi-Org. The latest solution guide provides details on which configurations are supported at a granular level. If you need to define settings per org unit, refer to the updated documentation or solution guide for supported options.","category":"definitional","topic":"SKU format and tax engine configuration in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling Multi-Org for a tenant, and what are the prerequisites?","response":"To enable Multi-Org for a tenant, first confirm that the customer is entitled to the feature; there are no free trials for MO. If Data Access Control (DAC) is enabled, it may need to be disabled before enabling MO. After confirming entitlement and disabling DAC if necessary, proceed with the enablement process, which may involve coordination with the provisioning team and support. If issues arise or L3 support is required, escalate to the appropriate team. Ensure that the customer has a clear plan for configuring the org hierarchy and assigning users to orgs after enablement.","category":"procedural","topic":"enabling multi-org for tenant"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer restructure their Multi-Org hierarchy if they are at the initial setup stage with no data in the system?","response":"If the customer is at the initial stage of Multi-Org setup and has no data or users tagged, they can request to clean up the old structure and replace it with a new one. The recommended approach is to raise a support ticket and assign it to the Tenant Hub team. If further escalation is needed, route the ticket to engineering. Internal documentation provides guidance for both customers and support teams on this process.","category":"procedural","topic":"restructuring multi-org hierarchy at initial setup"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to provision an existing single-tenant customer under a new global entity in a Multi-Entity hierarchy, and what are the technical considerations?","response":"It is technically possible to form a flexible entity hierarchy in Multi-Entity (ME) as long as there is no data movement between entities. The customer can retain the existing Zuora Billing Tenant as a child entity and provision a new global or parent entity. However, this is managed by the BFD team, and technical feasibility should be confirmed for each specific scenario. No data movement between entities is a key requirement for this approach.","category":"procedural","topic":"multi-entity hierarchy for existing tenant"}
{"instruction":"Does Multi-Org support FX Gain/Loss at the reporting level, and are there any limitations?","response":"Multi-Org supports currency conversion at the org level, and FX Gain/Loss is supported in both Finance Journal Run and Trial Balance reporting features. There was a previous limitation in reporting, but it is now confirmed that these features are supported. If you encounter issues, specify which reporting feature you are using.","category":"definitional","topic":"FX gain/loss reporting in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How can I get started with Multi-Org for a customer who is exploring the feature?","response":"To get started with Multi-Org, review the available documentation and best practices for configuration and enablement.

Customers should escalate through support if they encounter this issue.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"parent-child account relationships in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How does Workflow interact with Multi-Org, and what should be done if a workflow acts on data from the wrong org?","response":"If a workflow created for a specific org acts on data belonging to a different org, it may be due to outbound API calls within the workflow not carrying the org ID. There is no dedicated team for Multi-Org workflow issues; such cases should be triaged and troubleshooted by the workflow team. Ensure that workflows are correctly configured to include org-specific context in API calls to prevent cross-org data actions.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"workflow and org-specific data in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"Is there a public API to get the org hierarchy in Multi-Org, and what is the current status?","response":"There is no public API to get the org hierarchy in Multi-Org.

{"instruction":"How do you upload Accounting Periods in a multi-org environment, and are there any differences from a standard tenant? Also, do you need to create accounting periods for the root org when upgrading an existing tenant to multi-org?","response":"To upload Accounting Periods in a multi-org environment, you can use the same template as in a standard (single-org) tenant, but you must include an additional OrganizationName field. The value for this field should be the actual org name as defined in your hierarchy. When upgrading an existing tenant to multi-org, the upgrade process typically creates a set of accounting periods (APs) per org to match those originally defined pre-upgrade, including for the root org. If you are upgrading and already have APs created, defining orgs in your hierarchy should automatically create APs for you. For new tenants, you should create accounting periods for each org, including the root org.","category":"procedural","topic":"accounting periods upload in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What are the current release statuses (Beta, EA, GA) for multi-org, multi-entity, and related features, and is there guidance on when to use Multi-Entity versus Multi-Org?","response":"As of June 2025, all multi-org, multi-entity, and related features are in Early Access (EA).

{"instruction":"Are Analytics cards and datasets (such as the maximum limit of 5 analytics dashboards) a tenant-level or org-level limitation in multi-org? Can analytics data be restricted per org?","response":"Analytics is not currently multi-org aware. The limits, such as the maximum number of analytics dashboards, are set at the tenant level, meaning all orgs combined can only have up to the tenant-wide maximum. Datasets contain all data from the tenant and cannot be restricted per org.","category":"definitional","topic":"analytics limits and org data segregation"}
{"instruction":"Which configurations or settings are defined at the organization (org) level versus the tenant level when enabling multi-org?","response":"Currently, only the FX currency conversion setting is defined at the org level. All other configurations and settings remain at the tenant level. There are no other org-level configurations apart from the currency conversion setting at this time.","category":"definitional","topic":"org-level vs tenant-level settings in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to enable Multi-Org for a tenant that already has existing data (such as products, subscriptions, and configurations), or does the data need to be cleaned up beforehand? What are the potential issues or impacts?","response":"It is generally acceptable to enable Multi-Org (MO) after some data already exists in the tenant. Once the org hierarchy is set up, you can tag existing accounts to orgs using the data labeling API, which will also assign related subscriptions and other data to the correct org. Products can be assigned to orgs using the same API, or left untagged for global access across all orgs. Tenant-level configuration is typically not MO-specific, with a few exceptions, so most configurations do not need to be updated. There are no major issues expected, but the exact impact depends on the specific configurations already in place.","category":"procedural","topic":"enabling multi-org with existing data"}
{"instruction":"For multi-org customers using Stripe as a payment gateway, do they need a separate Stripe instance for each org, or is one Stripe instance sufficient? How are payment gateways configured and associated with accounts in a multi-org setup?","response":"In a multi-org setup, payment gateways (including Stripe) are configured at the tenant level, not at the org level. One Stripe instance is sufficient for all orgs. When a new org is added, no additional payment gateway setup is required; accounts in the new org can be assigned the already-configured payment gateway. All payment methods configured at the tenant level are visible to all users in all orgs, as these settings are not user access controlled.","category":"definitional","topic":"payment gateway configuration in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for deleting a child org unit from the organization tree in a multi-org environment, especially if the org has no transactional data?","response":"To delete a child org unit from the organization tree, a Jira ticket must be created for the Tenant Hub (THB) team. If the org is in a sandbox (SBX) environment and contains no transactional data, the process involves validating the org details, getting engineering and peer review, and then submitting a Change Management (CM) ticket. The business use case must be documented, and approvals updated as needed. The process is collaborative and involves multiple teams to ensure accuracy and compliance.","category":"procedural","topic":"deleting child org units in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What is the best automated approach for handling account recreation in the appropriate currency when a customer's billing address changes to a different country or region, or during a geographic trial-to-paid conversion in a multi-org setup?","response":"There is no fully automated approach in Zuora for this scenario. The recommended solution is to create a new billing account with the correct currency and assign it to the appropriate org. Use scheduled orders to create new subscriptions effective from the new term in the new org, and schedule cancellation of the existing subscriptions at the end of the current term in the current org. This approach has been used successfully by other customers and is considered best practice for this use case.","category":"best_practice","topic":"account recreation for currency/org change"}
{"instruction":"How can workflows be migrated from one org to another within the same tenant in a multi-org environment?","response":"Migrating workflows from one org to another within the same tenant is not natively supported as an org-to-org migration. The recommended method is to use the standard export and import workflow process, as documented in Zuora's Knowledge Center. This involves exporting the workflow from the source org and importing it into the target org, even if both are within the same sandbox tenant.","category":"procedural","topic":"workflow migration between orgs in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for moving an existing org under another org in the hierarchy (reparenting), and what are the risks or limitations?","response":"Officially, moving an org under another (reparenting) is not supported and may impact downstream applications. There is a private update API (/tenant-registry/updateOrganization) that can be used to change the parentOrgId, but this method lacks proper validation and can introduce issues such as circular parent/child loops, potentially breaking the hierarchy. This process is not fully tested end-to-end, and there may be impacts on integrations and product labeling. Any such changes should be tested in a sandbox and discussed with relevant teams before attempting in production.","category":"procedural","topic":"org reparenting in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected behavior for reports in a multi-org environment regarding data visibility for users with access to all orgs versus specific orgs?","response":"In a multi-org environment, users with access to all orgs should see data for all orgs in report outputs, while users with access to specific orgs should only see data for those orgs. However, there have been reports of discrepancies where deselecting some orgs results in more rows than expected, which may indicate a defect. Roll-up reporting should aggregate data based on the orgs selected, but some objects (like BillingSchedule/InvoiceSchedule) may not yet be fully multi-org aware, and gaps or defects may exist.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"reporting data visibility in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How can you obtain a report showing all users and the corresponding orgs to which they have access in a multi-org tenant?","response":"This information is not available via Data Query (DQ) or standard user tables. Support can access it via Secure Query UI by joining zb_user_profile, zb_user_profile_org, and zb_hierarchy_tag tables. There is also an undocumented/private API (GET /v1/multi-organizations/object-labels?objectType=UserProfile&objectId=...) that can return org assignments for a user profile. Deployment Manager has user-level info but does not support org details.

{"instruction":"Is it possible to change an account's org after creation in a multi-org environment, and what are the limitations?","response":"Yes, you can change an account's org after creation using the data labeling API. This tool can relabel the account and all its transactions to a new org. However, it does not update aggregated data such as journal entries (JE). Customers need to rerun reports to generate new results reflecting the updated org assignment. This process is intended for data migration or data fixes.","category":"procedural","topic":"changing account org assignment in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"Can a single customer account be shared across different orgs in a multi-org setup, or is org assignment mandatory for accounts?","response":"Once multi-org is enabled and the org hierarchy is created, new accounts must be assigned an org label; unlabeled accounts cannot be created through the UI or API. Existing unlabeled accounts from before MO enablement continue to exist and are shared across all orgs (tenant-level accounts). During data migration, some accounts can be left unlabeled, but for new accounts, org assignment is mandatory. Unlabeled accounts are visible to all orgs, while accounts labeled to a specific org are only visible within that org.","category":"definitional","topic":"account sharing and org assignment in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for creating accounting periods at the org level in a multi-org environment, and why might you be unable to select an accounting period when creating a journal run for an org?","response":"In a multi-org environment, accounting periods (APs) must be created for each org. If you are unable to select an accounting period when creating a journal run for an org, it is likely because org-level accounting periods have not been created yet. You can manually create APs for each org, after which the AP options should become available for selection in the journal run process.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"org-level accounting periods and journal runs"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected behavior for product and product rate plan org labeling in multi-org, and can you specify org labels during product creation via API?","response":"Org labels can be assigned to products and product rate plans, allowing different orgs to have separate product rate plans (e.g., different list prices per org). However, as of now, the organizationLabels field is only available in the GET response body of the API, not in the create call. Therefore, you cannot specify org labels during product creation via API; labeling must be done after creation using the data labeling API or through the UI. Price overriding during subscription creation is supported as usual.","category":"definitional","topic":"product and rate plan org labeling in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for deleting or disabling orgs in a multi-org environment, and what are the considerations for associated data like accounting periods and transactions?","response":"Deleting or disabling orgs is not natively supported in the UI. The process involves creating tickets for the Tenant Hub (THB) team and may require manual database changes, which are increasingly restricted. Org deletion must consider associated data: accounting periods (APs) can only be deleted if no revenue is associated, and accounting codes must not have transactions before deletion. Disabling multi-org is not supported for Z-Finance customers, as it can leave org-level accounting periods as dirty data. There is no formal rollback process once multi-org is enabled, especially for tenants with financial data.","category":"procedural","topic":"org deletion and data considerations in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What is the maximum number of orgs supported per tenant in multi-org, and how does licensing work?","response":"A customer can configure up to 100 orgs per tenant as the standard maximum. The licensing model is now based on the number of active subscribers across all orgs, rather than the number of orgs. The maximum number of orgs may be tiered based on license level for some clients, but 100 is the general standard.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi-org maximum orgs and licensing"}
{"instruction":"How does the org context switcher and user org assignment work in multi-org, and what are common issues with new orgs not appearing in the UI?","response":"When new orgs are created, they should appear in the org context switcher and be available for user assignment within a minute. If new orgs do not appear, it may be due to a sync or latency issue between the tenant hub and billing database. Logging out and back in, or using a new incognito session, may help. If the issue persists for more than an hour, it may require a support ticket to trigger a manual sync. There have also been cases where cached org hierarchies cause delays in the UI, and the cache may need to be invalidated or refreshed.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"org context switcher and org sync issues"}
{"instruction":"How does the data labeling API work for relabeling accounts, products, or users in multi-org, and what are common pitfalls?","response":"The data labeling API can be used to relabel accounts, products, or users to different orgs. For accounts, all related transactions are relabeled, but aggregated data like journal entries are not updated. For products, you can assign org labels after creation, but not during creation via API. When using the API, ensure you use the correct parameters: 'orgIds' expects UUIDs, while 'orgs' expects org names. Passing an org name to 'orgIds' can result in data becoming inaccessible. There is a known bug where the API may accept invalid payloads without proper validation, so always verify assignments after running jobs. If you need to unlabel products (remove org assignments), enhancements to the API may be required, as passing an empty orgIds array may not work as expected.","category":"procedural","topic":"data labeling API usage and pitfalls in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What are the limitations and roadmap items for multi-org, such as support for CPQ, reporting, and custom objects?","response":"Current limitations include: (1) Analytics dashboards and datasets are not multi-org aware; data is tenant-wide and cannot be restricted per org. (2) CPQ is not yet fully supported with multi-org, though work is ongoing and planned for future releases. (3) Some objects, such as BillingSchedule/InvoiceSchedule and custom objects, are not yet multi-org aware, and reporting on these may not respect org assignments. (4) Product and product rate plan org labeling is not available during creation via API, only after creation. (5) There is a hierarchy depth limit of 10 levels. (6) Segregation of chart of accounts (CoA) by org is on the backlog, with no committed release date. (7) Deleting or reparenting orgs is not fully supported and may require manual intervention.

{"instruction":"How does the multi-org feature interact with Data Access Control (DAC) and Multi-Entity (ME), and can they be enabled together?","response":"Multi-Org (MO) and Data Access Control (DAC) cannot co-exist; enabling both is a provisioning error. DAC must be disabled before enabling MO. For Multi-Entity (ME), MO can only be enabled for leaf entities, not parent entities. If both DAC and MO are enabled, a data fix may be required to resolve conflicts. Disabling MO is not supported due to finance implications and potential for dirty data. Coexistence of ME and MO is supported only for leaf entities, where both the entity hierarchy picker and org switcher will be available in the UI.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi-org, DAC, and multi-entity interactions"}
{"instruction":"How does the organization hierarchy depth limit work in multi-org, and can it be increased?","response":"There is an internal hierarchy depth limit of 10 levels in multi-org.

It is not documented in the Knowledge Center, but can be increased on request if a customer has a valid use case for a deeper hierarchy.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi-org hierarchy depth limit"}
{"instruction":"How does the trial balance and accounting close process work in multi-org? Are these processes separate for each org or consolidated?","response":"In multi-org, each org operates as its own legal entity with separate books. This means there are separate trial balances and separate journal runs for each org. The accounting close process is performed individually for each org, not as a single consolidated process across all orgs.","category":"definitional","topic":"trial balance and accounting close in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling multi-org for an existing customer, and who is responsible for creating the org hierarchy and labeling data?","response":"For existing customers not using DAC, after enabling multi-org, the customer (or their GS team) is responsible for designing and creating the org hierarchy and labeling object records (accounts, products, users) using the data labeling API. Engineering may assist early adopter customers, but the process is intended to be customer-driven once tools and processes are stable. For DAC customers, the existing tag hierarchy can be reused as the org hierarchy, and engineering can assist with migration.","category":"procedural","topic":"multi-org enablement and data labeling responsibility"}
{"instruction":"How does the organization object and orgId field work in APIs and reporting, and what format should be used for orgId in headers?","response":"The orgId field in API headers should use the 36-character UUID format (xx-xx-xx-xx). There is no conversion between 32- and 36-character formats. In reporting, the organization object is available in Data Query (DQ) and can be referenced from the Invoice and Account objects. If the organization object is missing in templates or DQ, it may be a tenant registry issue and should be reported to support.","category":"definitional","topic":"organization object and orgId format in APIs"}
{"instruction":"How does the org context switcher and data visibility work for custom objects in multi-org?","response":"Custom objects are currently supported at the tenant level, meaning records are visible to all orgs. There have been issues where custom object records are only available to certain orgs, which is considered a defect. The intended behavior is that custom object records should be visible to all orgs unless and until multi-org support is explicitly added for custom objects.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"custom object data visibility in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling multi-org in a sandbox or trial tenant, and what are the requirements?","response":"To enable multi-org in a sandbox or trial tenant, an order form is required. The Deal Desk team must be contacted to provision the tenant, and the enablement process follows standard procedures. For evaluation purposes, a new sandbox can be created for a limited period (e.g., 8 weeks) if the customer's requirements and urgency justify it.","category":"procedural","topic":"enabling multi-org in sandbox or trial tenant"}
{"instruction":"How does the data labeling API handle queries using ZoQL versus Data Query syntax, and what are the limitations?","response":"The data labeling API supports queries using ZoQL, which is similar to Salesforce SOQL and supports join queries. However, it does not support standard SQL syntax. If you need to perform complex joins, it is recommended to use Data Query to extract the list of IDs and then use the data labeling API with the ById query type. The ZoQL syntax can be more concise for simple queries, such as 'select Account.Id from RatePlanCharge where Product.Name = ...'.","category":"procedural","topic":"data labeling API query syntax"}
{"instruction":"How does the multi-org feature affect integrations with CPQ and other external systems?","response":"CPQ is not yet fully supported with multi-org, and integrations may fail if the org is not specified in the API header. For integrations where CPQ is used for only one org, it is possible to map all connector activity to a single org by adding the appropriate API header. However, the sync from Zuora to SFDC does not currently carry over the org attribute of transaction objects, which may cause issues. The roadmap includes future support for CPQ and multi-org integration.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi-org and CPQ integration"}
{"instruction":"How does the multi-org feature interact with reporting and analytics, and what are the current limitations?","response":"Analytics dashboards and datasets are not multi-org aware; data is tenant-wide and cannot be restricted per org. Reporting is generally multi-org aware, allowing data to be filtered by org using the org context switcher. However, some objects (such as BillingSchedule/InvoiceSchedule) are not yet fully multi-org aware, and gaps or defects may exist. The ProductOrgLabel object is not yet exposed in Data Query, limiting the ability to report on product-org assignments. Workarounds include using the GET_Catalog API to examine organizationLabels in the response payload.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi-org reporting and analytics limitations"}
{"instruction":"How does the process of enabling multi-org affect existing scheduled bill runs, payment runs, and reports?","response":"After enabling multi-org, existing scheduled bill runs, payment runs, and reports may need to be rescheduled to add the appropriate org IDs. Leaving org fields blank may result in no data being returned, rather than all data. The Bill Run UI does not currently display the orgs for which a bill run is configured, making it difficult to determine execution scope. This is a known limitation and may require manual review and rescheduling.","category":"procedural","topic":"impact of multi-org on scheduled runs and reports"}
{"instruction":"How does the data labeling API handle relabeling of accounts, products, and users, and what are the best practices for using it?","response":"The data labeling API can relabel accounts, products, and users to different orgs. For accounts, all related transactions are relabeled, but aggregated data like journal entries are not updated. For products, org labels can be assigned after creation, but not during creation via API. For users, there is a known defect where the data labeling job updates billing but not the Genesis service, leading to inconsistencies. Best practices include verifying assignments after running jobs, using the correct parameters ('orgIds' for UUIDs, 'orgs' for names), and avoiding passing org names to 'orgIds'. If issues arise, check job status and details using the GET /data-labeling-job/{job-id} and /detail APIs.","category":"best_practice","topic":"data labeling API best practices in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How does the multi-org feature affect the use of payment gateways and payment methods, and can payment gateways be configured per org?","response":"Payment gateways are configured at the tenant level in multi-org and cannot be configured per org. All payment methods and gateways are visible to all users in all orgs, as these settings are not user access controlled. When creating a new org, no additional payment gateway setup is required; accounts in the new org can use the existing tenant-level payment gateway.","category":"definitional","topic":"payment gateway configuration in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How does the process of enabling multi-org affect the organization object and its visibility in Data Query and templates?","response":"The organization object should be available in Data Query and can be referenced from the Invoice and Account objects.

{"instruction":"How does the multi-org feature affect the use of the API for account creation, and what are the requirements for org assignment?","response":"When multi-org is enabled and the org hierarchy is defined, the account creation API requires the organizationLabel field to be specified in the payload, or the Zuora-Working-Org header to be set. If the user is assigned to only one org, the account will be created in that org by default, even if the organizationLabel field is not populated. If the user is assigned to multiple orgs or is unlabeled, the API call will fail unless the org is specified. This behavior is consistent with Multi-Entity headers.","category":"definitional","topic":"API account creation and org assignment in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How does the multi-org feature affect the use of the Bill Run and Payment Run processes, and how are unlabeled accounts handled?","response":"Labeling a bill run with organizations restricts it to generate invoices for the labeled accounts and unlabeled accounts. However, payment run behavior is different: an org-labeled payment run will not pick up unlabeled accounts. There is an ongoing effort to make bill run behavior consistent with payment run, so that unlabeled accounts are not included unless explicitly specified. Customers are advised to label all accounts to avoid inconsistencies.","category":"definitional","topic":"bill run and payment run behavior in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How does the multi-org feature affect the use of the Data Query and Workflow tasks, and what are common issues?","response":"Data Query is generally multi-org aware, allowing data to be filtered by org using the org context switcher. However, some objects (such as BillingSchedule/InvoiceSchedule) are not yet fully multi-org aware, and gaps or defects may exist. The Data Query task in Workflow may fail to return data for org-tagged records if the required Zuora-Org-Ids header is not set.

{"instruction":"How does the multi-org feature affect the use of the API for account owner transfer and subscription transfer between orgs?","response":"The owner transfer API does not support transferring subscriptions between different orgs. The data labeling API can be used to transfer an account and all its transactions to a different org, but there is no validation, and this may impact financial reporting. Transferring a subsection of an account or a subscription from one org to another is not supported; it is an all-or-nothing process.","category":"definitional","topic":"account and subscription transfer between orgs in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How does the multi-org feature affect the use of the API for organization hierarchy management, and what are the risks of using private APIs?","response":"There is a private update API (/tenant-registry/updateOrganization) that can be used to change the parentOrgId and move an org under another. However, this method lacks proper validation and can introduce issues such as circular parent/child loops, potentially breaking the hierarchy. This process is not fully tested end-to-end, and there may be impacts on integrations and product labeling. Any such changes should be tested in a sandbox and discussed with relevant teams before attempting in production.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"organization hierarchy management and private APIs in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How does the multi-org feature affect the use of the API for organization deletion, and what are the current limitations?","response":"Deleting or disabling orgs is not natively supported in the UI. The process involves creating tickets for the Tenant Hub (THB) team and may require manual database changes, which are increasingly restricted. Org deletion must consider associated data: accounting periods (APs) can only be deleted if no revenue is associated, and accounting codes must not have transactions before deletion. Disabling multi-org is not supported for Z-Finance customers, as it can leave org-level accounting periods as dirty data. There is no formal rollback process once multi-org is enabled, especially for tenants with financial data.","category":"procedural","topic":"organization deletion and limitations in multi-org"}
{"instruction":"How does the multi-org feature affect the use of the API for organization number assignment, and is there a way to set the OrgNumber field?","response":"The OrgNumber field appears in the organization schema in Data Query, but there is currently no way to set this field via the UI or a public API.

{"instruction":"Explain how TCB (Total Contracted Billing) rounding works in Zuora Orders, including where rounding is set, how it behaves in the UI and API, and any known issues or workarounds.","response":"TCB rounding in Zuora Orders is handled differently between the UI and the API. The UI rounds TCB values based on the currency's rounding mode, which it retrieves from an endpoint (e.g., for JPY, the default is HALF_UP). However, the API returns non-rounded values, and the server-side (OrderDeltaMetrics) never applies rounding, regardless of whether accessed via Data Query or API. There is a known issue where the currency rounding setting is not always considered in the UI, as the frontend's zcurrencyPipe may not use the currency setting in some cases. If you encounter discrepancies, it's recommended to generate a HAR file of the order UI page for further diagnosis. The rounding logic is implemented in the frontend (ModelConverter file), and any inconsistencies should be reported for engineering review.","category":"definitional","topic":"TCB rounding in orders"}
{"instruction":"Describe the process and limitations for correcting the currency on subscriptions created with the wrong currency in Zuora Orders, especially after migration or integration errors.","response":"Once a subscription is created in Zuora Orders, its currency cannot be changed, as the subscription-level currency impacts downstream data such as metrics and invoices. If subscriptions were created with the wrong currency (e.g., due to migration or integration errors), the only supported correction is to cancel the current subscription and create a new one with the correct currency. This is because many functionalities and data are tied to the original currency, and simply changing the currency would not update all dependent data. Customers with complex integrations referencing subscription numbers may face significant challenges, as new subscriptions will have new numbers, potentially impacting other systems. There is no backend workaround to change the currency without recreating the subscription.","category":"procedural","topic":"Correcting subscription currency"}

{"instruction":"Explain the options and limitations for bulk-deleting DiscountApplyDetail records for specific ProductRatePlanChargeIds across many subscriptions in Zuora Orders.","response":"Bulk-deleting DiscountApplyDetail records for specific ProductRatePlanChargeIds is not directly supported in Zuora Orders, especially since these records are read-only. The recommended workaround is to remove the affected product and add it again, which applies the correct Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) setup. However, this can be challenging for customers with thousands of subscriptions, particularly when dealing with time-limited discounts. The support team typically does not fix customer mistakes by default and will need to know the impacted volume before considering any exceptions or engineering involvement. Customers are advised to provide the exact number of affected subscriptions when seeking further assistance.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Bulk delete DiscountApplyDetail records"}
{"instruction":"What causes SubscriptionMetricsSummary to not be generated for new subscriptions, and what are the recommended troubleshooting steps or workarounds?","response":"SubscriptionMetricsSummary may not be generated for new subscriptions due to rare concurrent issues during subscription creation, especially if a new version is created and then directly updated in a short time. This pattern is not friendly to summary metrics generation. The recommended workaround is to increase the duration between creating an order and performing a direct update—waiting at least 3 minutes can help eliminate the issue. If the problem occurs, engineering can re-trigger the migration for the affected subscriptions to generate the missing metrics. However, the issue may persist until a code fix is implemented. Customers are advised to adjust their integration patterns and, if necessary, request support to re-run the migration for all affected subscriptions.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"SubscriptionMetricsSummary generation"}

{"instruction":"What is the best practice for polling the status of async order jobs in Zuora Orders?","response":"The optimal polling interval for checking the status of async order jobs in Zuora Orders depends on the expected job duration. If the job is expected to finish quickly, polling every 5 seconds is reasonable. For longer-running jobs (e.g., up to 10 minutes), polling every 30 seconds is more appropriate. Adjust the polling frequency based on the typical completion time to balance timely updates with system load.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Async order job status polling"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer update the end date of a subscription or renewal dates in bulk, and what are the current limitations of Data Loader and Developer Tools for this use case?","response":"Updating the end date or renewal dates of subscriptions in bulk is a valid use case in Zuora Orders. While the POST /Order API allows updating the Current Term End Date or Subscription End Date via a 'Change the Terms and Conditions of a Subscription' order action, neither Data Loader nor Developer Tools currently support bulk updating of end dates—only start dates can be updated.

{"instruction":"Is it possible to update the PriceChangeOption of a previous charge segment in Zuora Orders? What is the recommended workaround if not?","response":"It is not possible to update the PriceChangeOption of a previous charge segment in Zuora Orders. The PriceChangeOption is intended for renewal and is only applicable to the last segment. If a workflow or API request attempts to update this field for a previous segment, it will result in an error. The recommended approach is to ensure that only the last segment's PriceChangeOption is updated as needed, and to review the API request body in any workflow tasks to avoid referencing previous segments.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Updating PriceChangeOption on previous charge segment"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer identify which draft or scheduled orders are using a specific Product Rate Plan, especially when trying to delete products from the catalog?","response":"Product Rate Plans associated with draft or scheduled orders are not stored in the rate plan object until the order is executed. To identify which draft or scheduled orders are using a specific Product Rate Plan, customers must use the GET order API to retrieve the content of each draft or scheduled order. There is currently no direct way to query this information from the product catalog or rate plan objects.

{"instruction":"What is the logic behind the 'Action' column in the Subscription Change History in Zuora Orders, particularly the difference between 'New Product' and 'Add Product'?","response":"The 'Action' column in the Subscription Change History is determined by the number of Add Product order actions in a single order. If there is only one Add Product order action, the action is shown as 'New Product.' If there are multiple Add Product order actions, the action is displayed as 'Add Product.' 'New Product' is essentially equivalent to 'Add Product,' but the naming is a legacy artifact from the amendment type. This inconsistency is known, and while it may cause confusion, changing it could impact customers who have already adopted the current behavior.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Change History Action column logic"}

{"instruction":"How does the 'Allow Order preview in closed accounting period' setting affect order previews and billing documents in Zuora Orders?","response":"The 'Allow Order preview in closed accounting period' setting only applies to preview calls. When enabled, it allows order previews to bypass validation against closed accounting periods. However, it does not permit posting billing documents (such as invoices or credit memos) in a closed accounting period. The restriction on posting billing documents remains enforced regardless of this setting.","category":"definitional","topic":"Order preview in closed accounting period"}
{"instruction":"What is the current status and roadmap for supporting co-terming (co-termination) of active subscriptions on a single account in Zuora Orders?","response":"Co-terming active subscriptions (aligning multiple subscriptions to the same renewal date) is a frequently requested feature by customers such as Asana, SimpliSafe, and Philips. While there were plans to support co-terming in Q2/Q3, as of October 2025, it is not yet on the official roadmap.

{"instruction":"How does multi-org enablement impact orders or subscriptions objects in Zuora Orders, and what is required when creating orders via API?","response":"With multi-org enablement, when creating an order via API, you must specify the zuora-org-ids in the header parameters. This ensures that the order is associated with the correct organization. There is no mandatory organizationLabel field for orders or subscriptions objects themselves, but the correct org context must be set via the API header. If errors occur even when passing the correct header, it may be due to catalog code issues, which could be fixed in staging environments.","category":"definitional","topic":"Multi-org enablement impact on orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for extending the end date of a paid annual plan by a specific number of days without additional charge in Zuora Orders?","response":"To extend the end date of a paid annual plan by a specific number of days without additional charge, you need to create an order that amends the subscription's term. The specific order action and steps may depend on the system's configuration and available features. If further clarification is needed, consult with the support team for guidance on the appropriate order action to use.","category":"procedural","topic":"Extend annual plan end date"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer activate a pending charge through the REST API in Zuora Orders?","response":"Customers can activate a pending charge through the REST API by following the documented process in Zuora's Knowledge Center.

For more detailed information, customers should consult with the Audit Trail team or the relevant product manager.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription settings update source in Audit Trail"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for investigating a scenario where a cancel order appears to be created by Zuora Support in the UI, but the customer claims it was done by their user?","response":"If a cancel order is created via the UI but appears under the Zuora Support account, first check if the cancellation was performed via a workflow, as workflows can be defined by support accounts. It's possible that a custom workflow button on the UI page was used, which would execute the action as an internal workflow (WF-INT). Internal workflows may not be visible to customers, so involve the workflow team for further confirmation if needed.

{"instruction":"What is the reason for a discrepancy in Cancellation Effective Date between the UI and data query in Zuora Orders, especially when the cancellation policy is 'End of Last Invoice Period'?","response":"When the cancellation policy is set to 'End of Last Invoice Period,' the CancellationEffectiveDate field may be null in the database and data query, even though a valid date is displayed in the UI. This is because the code does not populate the CancellationEffectiveDate field for this policy. The UI may display a calculated or derived date, but the underlying data remains null. If this discrepancy is problematic, open an L3 ticket for further investigation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Cancellation Effective Date discrepancy"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer report on MRR when discounts are applied mid-term to additional licenses, and what issues might arise?","response":"When additional licenses are added mid-term with a discount (e.g., during a Black Friday promotion), the discount may be applied at the rate plan level, affecting the total subscription value. This can result in the MRR being reduced instead of increased, as the discount is applied to the entire subscription rather than just the new license. Customers may need to adjust their reporting logic or consult with support for alternative approaches to accurately reflect MRR in such scenarios.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"MRR reporting with mid-term discounts"}
{"instruction":"What could cause a delay between the updated_on timestamp and the actual commit timestamp for a subscription record in Snowflake Data Share, and how should this be investigated?","response":"A delay between the updated_on timestamp and the actual commit timestamp for a subscription record in Snowflake Data Share can occur due to the way timestamps are generated and handled during data ingestion. The updated_on field in the billing database uses the -0800 timezone, while the transaction commit time may be in UTC. The difference may also be due to how Debezium reads the MySQL binary log and processes events. To investigate, check the process that outputs the timestamp values and ensure that datetime handling is consistent when copying data from the billing database to Snowflake. Review the ingestion pipeline and timezone conversions for potential issues.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Subscription ID delay in Snowflake Data Share"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer create a credit memo related to usage charges in Zuora Orders?","response":"Credit memos for usage charges cannot be created from bill runs as with other charge models (e.g., Flat Fee). To create a credit memo for usage, customers may need to create the credit memo directly from the invoice. If this is not possible, alternative approaches include reversing the invoice and deleting the usage. For further guidance, consult with the invoicing team, as credit memo functionality is owned by them.","category":"procedural","topic":"Credit memo creation for usage"}
{"instruction":"Is there a dashboard or tool available to track inbound order calls at the order action level in Zuora Orders?","response":"A request was made for a Grafana dashboard or equivalent tool to track inbound order calls at the order action level (e.g., create subscription vs. update product). No direct answer or solution was provided in the discussion, so the availability of such a dashboard is unclear.","category":"definitional","topic":"Order call dashboard availability"}
{"instruction":"What does the error 'Duplicate segment number generated' mean when running a preview order API call, and how should it be resolved?","response":"The error 'Duplicate segment number generated' during a preview order API call indicates that the system has detected duplicate segment numbers in the order payload. To resolve this, review the order request for any repeated or conflicting segment numbers and correct them. If the issue persists, escalate to engineering (L3) for further investigation, providing full error messages and relevant logs.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Preview order API duplicate segment error"}
{"instruction":"What could cause a custom field value on a subscription rate plan to not be copied during an amendment in Zuora Orders, and what factors should be checked?","response":"If a custom field value on a subscription rate plan is not copied during an amendment (e.g., price change via workflow), check whether the field's legacy value is set to True or False, as this may affect copying behavior. Compare with other fields that are copied correctly. If the issue persists, escalate to engineering for further investigation, providing tenant ID, subscription number, and order number.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Custom field not copied during amendment"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for owner transfer orders with a future effective date, and what are the limitations for bulk processing in Zuora Orders?","response":"When creating an owner transfer order with a future effective date, the owner transfer takes effect immediately upon activation, regardless of the specified effective date. To schedule owner transfers for future dates, use scheduled orders, but note that each scheduled order can only be for one subscription. For bulk processing, customers must create multiple scheduled orders—one per subscription. If all subscriptions share the same effective date, consider controlling order creation in the integration code to manage timing and API usage.","category":"procedural","topic":"Owner transfer order with future date"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to always apply a fixed discount amount in Zuora Orders, and what alternatives exist if not?","response":"Applying a fixed discount amount is not directly supported by discount charge models in Zuora Orders, as discount amounts are always calculated based on proration periods. If the discount period is identical to the regular charge period but overlaps with the subscription term, the calculated discount may not match the intended fixed amount. As an alternative, use a flat fee model with negative amounts to achieve a fixed discount effect.","category":"definitional","topic":"Fixed discount amount implementation"}
{"instruction":"What are the current limitations and roadmap for the Flexible Billing Attributes feature in Zuora Orders, particularly for customers using Orders Harmonization?","response":"For customers on Orders Harmonization, subscription-level billing attributes can only be managed via Orders API operations; the Orders UI is not available for this purpose. If the bill-to contact or payment term at the subscription level has been updated, the corresponding invoice cannot be unposted. To change these attributes, unpost and delete the invoice before making updates. The product team is aware of these limitations, and customers are encouraged to follow the documented steps for managing billing attributes.","category":"definitional","topic":"Flexible Billing Attributes limitations"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for increasing the maximum number of amendments per subscription in Zuora Orders, and what are the recommended actions for large subscriptions?","response":"To increase the maximum number of amendments per subscription, use the MAX_AMEND_PER_SUBSCRIPTION setting. The limit can be increased incrementally (e.g., by 5 or 15) to unblock customers. However, for very large subscriptions that reach the amendment limit, it is recommended to cancel the large version subscription and recreate it to avoid performance issues. Customers should be advised to manage subscription size and amendment count proactively.","category":"procedural","topic":"Subscription amendment limit increase"}
{"instruction":"How does multi-attribute pricing preview API error manifest in Zuora Orders, and what troubleshooting steps should be taken?","response":"Multi-attribute pricing preview API errors may occur in staging environments, sometimes due to database schema issues or pricing API errors. If the error is specific to certain tenants or only occurs for OCM (Open Charge Model) changes, check logs for more details and provide a HAR file for engineering review. If the issue is resolved in another tenant, the priority may be lower, but persistent errors should be escalated with detailed request IDs and payloads.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Multi-attribute pricing preview API error"}
{"instruction":"What is the impact of enabling 'Allow Order preview in closed accounting period' in Zuora Orders?","response":"Enabling 'Allow Order preview in closed accounting period' allows order previews to bypass validation against closed accounting periods, but does not permit posting billing documents (invoices, credit memos) in closed periods. The setting is limited to preview operations only.","category":"definitional","topic":"Order preview in closed accounting period"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for querying whether a product rate plan is used by a draft or scheduled order in Zuora Orders?","response":"Product rate plans associated with draft or scheduled orders are not stored in the rate plan object until the order is executed. To determine if a product rate plan is used by a draft or scheduled order, use the GET order API to inspect the content of each draft or scheduled order. There is no direct query available in the product catalog or rate plan objects for this purpose.","category":"procedural","topic":"Querying product rate plan usage in draft/scheduled orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the current status of exposing the SubscriptionMetricsSummary table in Object Query, Data Source, and Reporting in Zuora Orders?","response":"The SubscriptionMetricsSummary table is currently only available in Data Query. There are no immediate plans to expose it in Object Query, Data Source, or Reporting. Customers seeking this functionality should provide a valid business case to help prioritize the feature for future development.","category":"definitional","topic":"SubscriptionMetricsSummary table availability"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling the CommitmentManagement feature for a tenant in Zuora Orders, and what are the current limitations?","response":"The CommitmentManagement feature is under development and is not generally available. It can be enabled for specific tenants via a hidden T9 URL or by using the /Subscription.do?method=turnOnPermission&tenantIds=xxxx&name=CommitmentManagement endpoint. The feature is still in progress, and documentation is not yet published. Customers should not enable it unless instructed by the product team, and support staff may not be fully familiar with its operation until general availability.","category":"procedural","topic":"Enabling CommitmentManagement feature"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer compare the quantity on existing subscriptions with what's planned in a scheduled order before renewal consolidation, and is there a way to report on scheduled order quantities before activation?","response":"Currently, charges in a scheduled order do not exist in the database until the effective date, so Data Query can only return the current quantity from RatePlanCharges, not the future counts from a scheduled order. There is no built-in way to report on scheduled order quantities prior to activation, and quantity does not exist on the order action object today. The recommended workaround is to use a workflow that queries for pending orders scheduled in the next X days, iterates through them, and uses the GET Order API to extract planned quantities from order actions. There are no current plans to make scheduled order contents available in reporting tables or Data Query before execution, and metrics like Order Delta Quantity are not generated until the order is executed. This requirement is on the backlog for future consideration.","category":"procedural","topic":"scheduled order quantity reporting"}
{"instruction":"Why does the OLI Owner Account field not show up for the assigned account, and can the OLI Owner Account be changed after order completion?","response":"The OLI (Order Line Item) Owner Account field allows you to assign the owner of the order line item, but nothing actually shows up for the assigned owner account in the UI. The OLI is not available on the account details page, regardless of whether the account is the invoice owner or OLI owner, which is a functional gap. The relationship between the student and OLI exists in the OLI table, so you could create a notification based on the OLI.ownerAccountId field. However, there is no way for the new owner to see the purchases assigned to them in the UI. You can change an OLI's owner account if it's still in 'Executing' status, but not after the order is completed.","category":"definitional","topic":"OLI owner account behavior"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to preview usage charges using the Order API's Preview an Order endpoint?","response":"No, the Preview an Order API does not support previewing usage charges. Usage charges are not supported in the order preview functionality.","category":"definitional","topic":"order preview usage charges"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected behavior of the Invoice Group Number field for return orders, and can return OLIs be consolidated into a single credit memo?","response":"Return orders do not currently support setting the invoice group number. When a return order is activated, the invoice group number is cleared from the OLIs, resulting in each line item generating a separate credit memo. This is expected behavior and not configurable. The Invoice Group Number feature is designed to consolidate invoices for subscriptions and OLIs (Sales), but does not apply to Return OLIs. There is no workaround to consolidate credit memos for return OLIs at this time; a product enhancement is needed to support this, and it is being tracked as a roadmap item.","category":"definitional","topic":"return order invoice group number"}
{"instruction":"How does Zuora handle subscription term end dates, and why does a 12-month term subscription show an end date that appears to be a year and a day?","response":"Zuora's system sets the end date of a subscription as the start date of the next period. This means that for a 12-month term starting on 6/1/2025, the end date will be 6/1/2026, which is exclusive. The invoice service period is displayed properly, but at the subscription level, the end date is exclusive, while on invoices it is inclusive. This is normal and expected behavior in Zuora.","category":"definitional","topic":"subscription term end date logic"}
{"instruction":"Why did a subscription cancellation trigger two events, and is it expected to see two INSERT actions for a single cancellation?","response":"In the cancellation operation, Zuora only inserts a single subscription status=cancelled record. If two insert CDC (Change Data Capture) events are triggered, it may require further investigation by the BFD team. Sometimes, the function needs to update the previous version and insert a new version of the subscription, which could result in multiple log entries. It is suggested to add a changeType=insert condition to filter events, and if the issue persists, try to reproduce it and involve the appropriate team for further analysis.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"subscription cancellation event duplication"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer update custom field values for non-latest charge segments, such as past rate plan charges, and is there an API to do this?","response":"The API endpoint PUT_UpdateSubscriptionCustomFieldsOfASpecifiedVersion can change custom fields for subscription, rate plan, and rate plan charge objects, including non-latest versions. If Orders is not enabled, the SOAP update can also update custom fields. This allows customers to correct custom field values for past billing data by specifying the appropriate version in the API call.","category":"procedural","topic":"update custom fields on non-latest charge segments"}
{"instruction":"What is the cause of internal errors on the v1/orders API related to custom fields, and how can the problematic custom field be identified?","response":"Internal errors on the v1/orders API can occur if the value of a custom field is invalid, such as containing unsupported characters like emojis. Zuora Billing supports only BMP encoding in the Unicode Standard, so characters outside BMP (e.g., emojis) are not supported. The specific custom field causing the error can sometimes be identified by reviewing the error details or logs; in one case, the field CustomerComments__c on the subscription model was identified as the source of the issue.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders API custom field encoding errors"}
{"instruction":"Why do some custom fields on the subscription object get wiped between subscription versions, and how can the cause be checked?","response":"If custom field values are wiped between subscription versions, there is currently no direct way to check the cause of these changes from the logs. The system does not provide detailed audit logs for custom field changes between subscription versions at this time.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"custom field changes between subscription versions"}
{"instruction":"What is the limitation when using specific characters in text custom fields on the Subscription object, and what causes internal errors with the Create Order API?","response":"Zuora Billing supports only BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane) encoding in the Unicode Standard. When submitting data through the Zuora UI or API, only characters supported in BMP are allowed. Using characters outside BMP, such as emojis, will cause internal errors with the Create Order API. Customers should avoid using unsupported characters in text custom fields.","category":"definitional","topic":"custom field character encoding limitations"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer fetch details related to subscription upliftment if the Revenue Schedule endpoint is not available, and what alternatives exist if Billing Revenue is not enabled?","response":"The Revenue Schedule endpoint is a billing revenue feature and requires Billing Revenue to be enabled. If the tenant does not have Billing Revenue enabled, customers should use object-query or data sources in Zuora Billing to extract subscription data. If they are using Zuora Revenue, they should consult the report or BI views of the Revenue API. The error 'You do not have permission to perform this operation' indicates a permissions or configuration issue related to the endpoint being used.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"subscription upliftment data extraction without billing revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer update the charge trigger date for a charge with a future trigger date after a quantity or price change order has already created a new segment, and what are the limitations?","response":"If a charge has a trigger date set in the future and a subsequent order changes the quantity or price, creating a new segment, the system will block moving the trigger date forward if there are multiple segments and no billing/trigger has occurred. The charge cannot be updated before its original start date. The recommended workaround is to remove the original charge and then add and activate it with the correct quantity and new start date. The SpecificUpdateDate field of the updateProduct order action may also be relevant, but direct updates before the original start date are not supported.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"charge trigger date update after segment creation"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to view data after an Order API rollback in Zuora, and can customers access rollback information?","response":"There is no direct way for customers to view data after an Order API rollback in Zuora. The system does not provide a built-in method to access rollback information or the number of rollback order calls. Customers may need to provide more context or clarify their use case for further assistance.","category":"definitional","topic":"order API rollback data visibility"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'BillToContactId' and 'BillToContact.Id' in the subscription object, and how should customers use these fields?","response":"'BillToContactId' comes directly from the Subscription object, while 'BillToContact.Id' is accessed through the associated BillToContact object. Both fields refer to the same underlying contact, and customers can use either field. In Data Query, 'BillToContactId' is available on the Subscription object. The filter 'BillToContactId is not null' is equivalent to 'BillToContact.Id is not null.' However, there may be a defect if filtering by 'BillToContactId is not null' still includes subscriptions without a BillToContactId.","category":"definitional","topic":"subscription BillToContactId fields"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer retrieve Sold To contact information for Order Line Items (OLIs) using Workflow Query tasks, and is there a limitation?","response":"Order Line Items (OLIs) directly link to Bill To and Ship To contacts but not the Sold To contact. To associate a Sold To contact with a non-subscription charge, it must be set at the individual OLI level. However, in Workflow Query tasks, there is a limitation: Sold To data cannot be retrieved for each OLI, even if it is assigned. This is a known limitation, especially when Flexible Billing is enabled for the tenant.","category":"definitional","topic":"OLI Sold To contact retrieval limitation"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice regarding Orders Harmonization (OH) versus moving to full Orders, and what guidance should be given to customers?","response":"Orders Harmonization (OH) allows customers to use all order functionalities and features, and moving to full Orders is not recommended unless there is a specific need. OH is considered the recommended long-term configuration for most customers. The documentation should be updated for better clarity, but the current guidance is to keep the tenant in Orders Harmonization mode and not re-enable Orders unless there is a compelling reason. OH should be treated as Orders, and customers should not expect to migrate to full Orders as a default next step.","category":"best_practice","topic":"orders harmonization guidance"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit on the number of subscription versions or orders that can be created per subscription, and what happens if the limit is reached?","response":"Performance degradation starts at 100 orders per subscription, and the system will throw an error at 1000 orders. Customers should be aware of these limits to avoid performance issues.","category":"definitional","topic":"subscription order limits"}

It cannot be updated directly without creating an order.","category":"definitional","topic":"subscription payment term update"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer enable the 'zuora retry mechanism' for async order creation, and what is the process?","response":"To enable the 'zuora retry mechanism' (order.create.async.lockCompetition.retryTimes), the customer should confirm the tenant ID and request enablement via a support ticket. The process involves tracking the request in a Jira ticket and confirming the tenant details before the feature is enabled.","category":"procedural","topic":"async order retry mechanism enablement"}
{"instruction":"What is the cause of the error 'You need to provide billToContactId or set clearingExistingBillToContact to true' during an Owner Transfer Order action, and how should it be resolved?","response":"The error occurs because the BillTo contact is associated with the invoice owner account. When transferring the invoice owner to another account, the specified BillTo may no longer be associated with the new invoice owner account. To resolve this, either clear the customized BillTo by setting clearingExistingBillToContact to true (in which case you do not need to provide billToContactId), or provide a billToContactId that belongs to the new invoice owner account without setting the clearingExistingBillToContact field.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"owner transfer order billToContactId error"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between the v1 Orders API and the PUT /v1/subscriptions/{subscription-key} endpoint, and when should each be used?","response":"The v1 Orders API is a complex endpoint that allows for multiple order actions in a single call, while the PUT /v1/subscriptions/{subscription-key} endpoint breaks up different subscription/order actions into separate endpoints, making it easier to use for simple use cases. The Orders API is recommended for more complex scenarios requiring multiple actions, while the subscription endpoint is suitable for straightforward updates. The choice depends on the complexity of the use case and the need for consolidated versus granular API calls.","category":"comparison","topic":"orders API vs subscription endpoint"}
{"instruction":"How does the chargeTypeToExclude field work in the Create Order API, and why are one-time charges still included in invoices when OLIs are present?","response":"The chargeTypeToExclude field in the Create Order API is intended to apply only to subscription charges. When the order contains both subscriptions and Order Line Items (OLIs), one-time charges are still included in the invoice, which is the expected behavior. The exclusion works as intended when only subscriptions are present. In v2 of the API, the chargeTypeToExclude option is not available. This behavior is by design and not a bug.","category":"definitional","topic":"chargeTypeToExclude behavior with OLIs"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer create a separate payment for each invoice using the Orders API, instead of one payment for all invoices?","response":"The Orders API currently creates one payment for all invoices by default.

Customers may need to use additional payment APIs or workflows to achieve this functionality.","category":"definitional","topic":"separate payments per invoice with Orders API"}
{"instruction":"What is the equivalent REST error code for the SOAP 'ZUORA_LOCK_COMPETITION' message, and how should customers handle lock contention errors in REST?","response":"The equivalent REST error code for the SOAP 'ZUORA_LOCK_COMPETITION' message is any error code ending in 50, such as 58560050, which indicates a locking contention. Customers should implement retry logic when encountering this error, as it occurs when multiple concurrent requests attempt to modify the same account. Retrying the request after a short delay is the recommended approach.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"REST lock contention error handling"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer reduce or disable preview API calls to Avalara when using Direct Avalara Integration, and what is the impact of disabling tax calculation in order preview?","response":"Customers can request to disable taxation calculation for order preview calls, which will result in the tax amount in the order preview response being 0. This reduces the number of API calls to Avalara and associated costs. Disabling this feature does not impact other tax calculations, but customers should confirm that they do not need tax values in order preview responses before proceeding.","category":"best_practice","topic":"reducing Avalara API calls in order preview"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to send payment profile information (Payment Method and Payment Gateway ID) during order creation, or must the Upsert Payment Profiles API be used after subscription creation?","response":"It is possible to send payment profile information during order creation. This has been supported since the 2024-Q4 release, although there was a documentation typo until early 2025. Customers can include payment method and payment gateway ID in the order creation payload without needing to use the Upsert Payment Profiles API after subscription creation.","category":"procedural","topic":"payment profile info in order creation"}
{"instruction":"What is the cause of the error 'date string can not be less than 19 characters' when executing the Amend API, and how can it be resolved?","response":"The error 'date string can not be less than 19 characters' is caused by an incorrect date format in the API payload. The date must be in the correct format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'). Additionally, the amendments section must be included in the payload. If the error persists after correcting the date format and including the amendments section, further investigation with the request ID may be necessary.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Amend API date format error"}
{"instruction":"What is the purpose of the 'Reset Rollover' field for Overage-smoothing Usage charges, and can it be updated via API?","response":"The 'Reset Rollover' field for Overage-smoothing Usage charges is enabled by default and is intended to control whether unused usage rolls over to the next period. However, this field does not appear to be updatable via the API, and attempts to change it through the Update Product Amendment do not take effect.

{"instruction":"How can a customer generate separate invoices for subscriptions and OLIs, and what is required to use the invoiceGroupNumber field for grouping?","response":"To generate separate invoices for subscriptions and OLIs, customers can set the same invoiceGroupNumber for the subscription and the corresponding order line item. This will group the invoice items together in a single invoice. The invoiceGroupNumber field must be enabled on both the subscription and OLI, which requires enabling Flexible Billing Attributes. If the field is not visible on the subscription, enabling Flexible Billing will resolve the issue.","category":"procedural","topic":"invoice grouping for subscriptions and OLIs"}
{"instruction":"What characters are supported in the invoiceGroupNumber field, is it case sensitive, and are multibyte characters allowed?","response":"The invoiceGroupNumber field supports alphanumeric characters as well as special characters '.', '-', '_', and '#'. The database search function is case-insensitive. While the field accepts a string of up to 255 characters, it is recommended to use standard alphanumeric characters. Multibyte characters are not explicitly supported, and customers should clarify their use case if they wish to use non-standard characters.","category":"definitional","topic":"invoiceGroupNumber character support"}
{"instruction":"How long are async order preview job responses kept in Zuora, and is there a way to reduce the time for async operations?","response":"Async order preview job responses are kept as long as the order is not deleted; Zuora does not delete these responses. To reduce the time for async operations, it is important to clarify whether the delay is in triggering the async API or in retrieving the job status. There is no direct way to reduce the time for async operations, and performance may vary depending on system load and complexity of the request.","category":"definitional","topic":"async order preview job retention and performance"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling Orders Harmonization versus full Orders, and should customers plan to move to full Orders?","response":"Orders Harmonization (OH) is sufficient for most customers and is considered the recommended long-term configuration. Moving to full Orders is not necessary unless there is a specific need for features only available in full Orders. The guidance is to keep the tenant in Orders Harmonization mode and not re-enable Orders unless required. Documentation should be updated for clarity, but OH should be treated as Orders for most purposes.","category":"best_practice","topic":"orders harmonization vs full orders"}

{"instruction":"What determines the order in which products are listed in a subscription on the Zuora Orders screen, and can this order be controlled for display purposes?","response":"The order in which products are listed in a subscription on the Zuora Orders screen appears to be system-driven and may seem random. There is no clear documentation or confirmation that the order is based on the selection order in quoting. If a specific display order is required, further testing or clarification from the product team may be necessary, as the current behavior does not guarantee control over the product listing sequence.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders product display order in subscription"}
{"instruction":"How can I resolve the error 'The Segment Value field must be less than 15 characters' when creating an order with two subscriptions in Zuora?","response":"This error is related to a custom field, SegmentValue__c, which has a defined length of 15 characters. The field should not be passed or should be left blank if not needed. If the error occurs even when the field is not explicitly passed, verify the payload and ensure that the field is not included or is within the character limit. Double-check the field definition and the data being sent in the order creation request.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders custom field length error"}
{"instruction":"Why does an order call fail with 'internal_server_error' and a message indicating 'Not enough balance' from the gateway, and how should this be handled?","response":"An order call may fail with 'internal_server_error' and a message such as '{\"gatewayResponse\":{\"code\":\"12\",\"message\":\"Not enough balance\"}}' when there is an issue with payment processing, such as insufficient funds. Although this seems like it should be a payment or gateway error, the error is surfaced as an internal server error due to the architecture of the V2 API, which is built on top of multiple V1 APIs. This layered approach makes troubleshooting difficult. The recommended action is to create a support ticket and involve the team responsible for the V2 API, as the root cause may not be easily identifiable otherwise. Additionally, it is advised not to use the V2 API for new integrations, as it is not recommended and is harder to support.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders payment gateway error handling"}
{"instruction":"What is the workaround for the UI issue where the order creation page collides with the preview tab, order action tab, and charges, as reported by some users but not reproducible in all tenants?","response":"The UI collision issue on the order creation page, where the page overlaps with the preview tab, order action tab, and charges, is a known bug addressed in UIA-4077. The fix is scheduled for release in Q2.2.0. The issue occurs when the user performs an order action with the Terms tab active. As a workaround, users should switch to another tab (such as Included Products or Order Actions) before performing the order action. If the issue persists, creating a UIA L3 ticket is recommended.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders UI tab collision workaround"}
{"instruction":"How can Vimeo track and bill usage in Zuora such that overage is recognized but not billed until customer confirmation, and can mediation be used for this scenario?","response":"Zuora does not natively support partial rating and billing of usage where overage is recognized but held without billing until customer confirmation. For example, if a customer exceeds their bandwidth limit, Zuora cannot automatically hold the excess usage for later billing or write-off based on customer input. Mediation may be able to support this kind of usage handling, but further consultation with the product manager for mediation is recommended to explore possible solutions.","category":"best_practice","topic":"orders usage overage handling and mediation"}
{"instruction":"How can I preview only the next billing cycle's invoice in Zuora Orders, excluding the current billing cycle, especially when a discount is added effective from the next cycle?","response":"To preview only the next billing cycle's invoice in Zuora Orders, use the order preview with the preview type set to 'number of periods' and specify the appropriate document date and target date. The order preview will return only un-invoiced periods. For example, if the current invoice has already been generated and a discount is added effective from the next billing cycle, setting the preview period to 1 and the target date to the start of the next cycle should return only the invoice for that period.

{"instruction":"What is the status of the pagination enhancement for the Order detail page in Zuora, and does it apply to the order creation page?","response":"The pagination enhancement for the Order detail page is marked as 'dev done' and is scheduled for release in Q3.0.0. The enhancement applies to the order creation page as well, following similar improvements made to the Subscription detail page.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders pagination enhancement status"}
{"instruction":"How should latency between order creation and the triggering of the 'Order Action Processed' callout be investigated, and what teams should be involved?","response":"If there is a significant delay between order creation and the triggering of the 'Order Action Processed' callout, compare the order timestamp with the notification history and check the Zuora Health Dashboard for latency spikes. If the delay is confirmed, consult the notification team for further investigation, as the issue may be related to notification processing rather than order processing itself.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders callout latency investigation"}
{"instruction":"Why does the total price show as 0 in the invoice preview for a usage per unit charge model in Zuora Orders, and how should usage be handled for accurate billing?","response":"In Zuora Orders, the total price in the invoice preview for a usage per unit charge model is always 0 unless usage records are uploaded. This is expected behavior, as the system cannot preview unbilled usage without a quantity. To generate a non-zero total, input the unbilled usage quantity when previewing the invoice. The process is: create the order and subscription, then upload usage records via the usage menu. The total billing amount will reflect the uploaded usage. The quantity cannot be set in the order payload; it is managed separately after subscription creation.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders usage per unit billing process"}
{"instruction":"How can I resolve overlapping columns (Charge Date and Charge Name) after customizing the Invoice details UI to add Sold to state and city at the invoice item level?","response":"Overlapping columns in the Invoice details UI after customization can be resolved by re-adding the fields, which may reset the table structure. If the issue persists, adjust the column width on the configuration UI page by dragging the columns in the table. If the problem recurs in other tenants, open a Level 3 (L3) ticket for the UIA team to investigate, as it may be a UI bug.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders invoice details UI column overlap"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to prevent overdue notifications from being sent to a supervisor when a subscription under an account has been cancelled, and can this be configured in Zuora's Events & Notifications system?","response":"To prevent overdue notifications from being sent to a supervisor when a subscription is cancelled, add a filter in the invoice overdue notification to check if the subscription has been cancelled. However, consider whether cancellation should exempt the account from owing past invoices, as the standard behavior is to continue sending overdue notifications for unpaid invoices regardless of subscription status.","category":"best_practice","topic":"orders overdue notification filtering for cancelled subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'lock competition' error occur when creating amendments in Zuora, and does the system wait or retry before returning this error?","response":"The 'lock competition' error occurs when another process is holding a lock on the subscription or account during amendment creation. The system may show 'waitForLock' messages in the logs, but only someone familiar with the code can confirm whether the system waits or retries before returning the error. In some cases, duplicate amendments may be created instead of a lock competition error if idempotency is not enabled. For further investigation, an L3 ticket should be created for the SUB team.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders lock competition error handling"}
{"instruction":"Why might a workflow callout task fail with an 'internal error' but still return a status code 200 (OK) when using the POST /v1/orders endpoint, and how should this be interpreted?","response":"A workflow callout task may fail with an 'internal error' message but still return a status code 200 (OK) due to the way the API handles errors internally. The response will indicate 'success': false and provide a processId and error message, even though the HTTP status is 200. This means the API call was received and processed, but the operation itself failed. Review the error message and processId for troubleshooting, and consult logs for more details.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders API error handling and status codes"}
{"instruction":"What are the pros and cons of using Orders API versus Subscribe/Amend API in Zuora, and is there a comparison available for customers considering migration?","response":"The Orders API uses newer code and supports all Zuora features, including recent attributes and advanced functionality. The Subscribe/Amend (S/A) API relies on legacy code, lacks support for new features, and may not work for certain scenarios (e.g., subscribing to plans with PPDD charges). For customers considering migration, Orders API is recommended for future-proofing and feature adoption, while S/A API remains in maintenance mode. A detailed cheat sheet or comparison may not be readily available, but the main differences are feature support and codebase modernization.","category":"comparison","topic":"orders vs subscribe/amend API"}
{"instruction":"How can I retrieve both the subscription owner's and invoice owner's account names in Zuora reporting, given current data source limitations?","response":"In Zuora reporting, the Account object can be joined with Subscription to get the subscription owner's name. However, to retrieve both the subscription owner's and invoice owner's account names, there is currently no direct relationship in the Subscription metadata for invoiceOwnerId to AccountId. To include the invoice owner name in a subscription-based report, an enhancement is required to add the Account reference for invoiceOwnerId. Until then, alternative objects or methods may be needed, such as custom queries or enhancements requested from the Subscription team.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders reporting subscription and invoice owner names"}
{"instruction":"Why is the Invoice Group Number field missing under the Subscription data source in Reporting, and can it be made available?","response":"The Invoice Group Number field is available in the Data Source but not directly accessible within the Reporting section under the Subscription data source. Making this field available in Reporting would require an enhancement to the reporting functionality. The Reporting team has recommended checking with the orders or subscription team for confirmation and potential inclusion as an enhancement.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders reporting invoice group number field"}
{"instruction":"Why might a customer on Orders Harmonization (OH) see a pop-up warning about S&A feature end of support from February 2026, and is this message accurate?","response":"There is no longer a deadline of February 2026 for the end of support for Subscribe and Amend (S/A) APIs. The message about S&A feature end of support from February 2026 has been removed from the Knowledge Center and is not accurate. Customers can continue using S/A integrations, and the objects will remain in maintenance mode indefinitely with no set end-of-support or end-of-life date. If the pop-up appears, it may be referencing outdated release notes or documentation.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders harmonization S&A end of support messaging"}
{"instruction":"Can a customer continue using the Subscribe and Amend API after enabling Orders Orchestration or Orders Harmonization, and is there a deadline for migration?","response":"There is no deadline for discontinuing the Subscribe and Amend (S/A) API, even after enabling Orders Orchestration or Orders Harmonization. Customers can continue using their existing S/A integrations and adopt Orders integration for new features as needed. The best practice is to follow the guidance in the FAQ about Orders Harmonization, and the S/A objects will remain in maintenance mode indefinitely.","category":"best_practice","topic":"orders harmonization S&A API usage"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to revert Orders Harmonization after enabling it, and is it safe to do so?","response":"It is not recommended to revert Orders Harmonization after enabling it. Most customers' sandboxes were batch enabled in the past, and reverting is generally not supported or advised. If a customer has a specific need to revert, further investigation is required, but the standard guidance is to keep Orders Harmonization enabled.","category":"best_practice","topic":"orders harmonization revert policy"}
{"instruction":"Why is the account number (existingAccountNumber) required when creating an order for an existing subscription in Zuora Orders API, even if the subscriptionNumber is specified?","response":"The existingAccountNumber is required when creating an order for an existing subscription because a subscription can have different invoice and subscription owners. The system cannot deduce the account number from the subscription number alone, so the account number must be explicitly specified to associate the order with the correct account. This is important for audit trail and reporting purposes.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders API account number requirement"}
{"instruction":"Can a new contact be created at the subscription level through the Orders API, similar to the UI, during order creation?","response":"No, the Orders API does not support creating a new contact at the subscription level during order creation. The UI achieves this by calling another API to create the contact on the fly, but this functionality is not part of the create order API itself. There are no current plans to support this in the create order API.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders API contact creation at subscription level"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to create an OLI order and generate the invoice and payment (with authorization) in a single API call in Zuora Orders, and what are the key payload requirements?","response":"Yes, it is possible to create an Order Line Item (OLI) order and generate the invoice and payment (with authorization) in a single API call using the appropriate processing options. The payload must include the existingAccountNumber, orderDate, orderLineItems with item details, and processingOptions with billingOptions (documentDate, targetDate, runBilling, collectPayment, and electronicPaymentOptions with paymentMethodId and authTransactionId). Ensure the correct billingRule is used (e.g., TriggerWithoutFulfillment) for successful processing.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders OLI invoice and payment in single call"}
{"instruction":"How does Zuora handle discounts applied mid-month for usage charges, and does the enhanced discount feature address proration?","response":"Out-of-the-box discounting in Zuora does not handle proration for usage charges. If a discount percentage is updated mid-month, the system applies the discount for the entire month based on the current setting, not prorated for the period before and after the change. The enhanced discount feature is applicable only for One Time and Recurring charges, not for usage charges. To achieve proration, explicitly set the end date on the previous discount charge, but editing the end date may not be possible after subscription creation.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders usage discount proration"}
{"instruction":"Is the RatePlanCharge.RolloverBalance field available for use in invoice templates, and are there plans to expose it in the RatePlanCharge object?","response":"The RatePlanCharge.RolloverBalance field is not currently exposed in the RatePlanCharge object for use in invoice templates, although it can be retrieved via the /v1/action/query API. There is ongoing discussion about whether to expose this field, as its value changes with each new usage upload and may not always match the invoice amount. The field is primarily used for ACB (Available Credit Balance) use cases, and documentation or behavior may need clarification before making it widely available.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders RatePlanCharge RolloverBalance field exposure"}
{"instruction":"Is the QuickStart API (also referred to as v2 API) recommended for new integrations in Zuora, and is it deprecated?","response":"The QuickStart API, sometimes erroneously called the v2 API, is not recommended for new integrations in Zuora. It is not deprecated, but no new features will be built for it. Customers are advised to use the v1 API for new integrations.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders QuickStart API recommendation"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between Orders Harmonization and full Orders in Zuora, and is Orders Harmonization the recommended long-term configuration?","response":"Orders Harmonization (OH) allows customers to use all order functionalities and features, and is considered sufficient for most use cases. Moving to full Orders is not generally recommended unless there are specific requirements. OH is the recommended long-term configuration, and customers should treat OH as equivalent to Orders for functional and new feature adoption. Documentation is being updated to clarify this guidance.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders harmonization vs full orders"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the notes field or custom fields on a subscription via API in Zuora Orders, given the deprecation of Subscribe and Amend features?","response":"Updating the notes field or custom fields on a subscription via API is a common use case. The current CRUD PUT Subscription update API is planned for deprecation along with Subscribe and Amend features, but a new REST API is being developed to replace this functionality. The new API will allow updating custom fields and notes without requiring an order call. The estimated availability for this new API was end of June, but the timeline may have shifted due to priority changes. Customers should monitor updates for the new API's release.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders API update subscription notes and custom fields"}
{"instruction":"How can I disable Avalara or all tax calculations during order preview in Zuora, and is this setting self-service?","response":"To disable Avalara or all tax calculations during order preview, enable the tenant property PREVIEW_INVOICE_SKIP_TAX. This setting causes the order preview to skip tax calls when previewTypes=BillingDocs. It is not a self-service setting and must be enabled by Zuora Support. It works for all tax integrations, not just Avalara.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders disable tax calculation in preview"}
{"instruction":"Why are discount and discountDelta fields in chargeMetrics null when using the v1/orders/preview API, even though a discount charge is present in the request? How can the discount amount be populated in these fields?","response":"When using the v1/orders/preview API, the discount and discountDelta fields in chargeMetrics may return null even if a discount charge is present in the request. This can occur if the discount is not applied to a regular recurring charge, as discounts on CMRR (Contracted Monthly Recurring Revenue) are not supported. To ensure these fields are populated, the discount must be applied to a regular recurring charge, not just to CMRR or other charge types. If the issue persists, especially in the case of evergreen subscriptions, it is recommended to submit an L3 support ticket for further investigation.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How is 'today's MRR' calculated in Zuora, and how can a customer replicate this calculation to send the value to Salesforce?","response":"'Today's MRR' (Monthly Recurring Revenue) in Zuora is determined by filtering the charges that are active on a given day and summing them. This is the same logic used in the Zuora UI. There is no direct API call to retrieve this value, nor is it stored as a field in the Zuora database. To replicate this calculation in Salesforce, customers should filter for all active charges on the desired day and sum their values. This approach can be implemented in Salesforce by syncing the relevant charge data and performing the aggregation there.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"Why does the chargeSegments array appear in the response payload when using the GET_SubscriptionsByKey API with charge-detail=all-segments, even though it is not documented?","response":"When using the GET_SubscriptionsByKey API with the charge-detail parameter set to all-segments, the response payload includes a chargeSegments array. This array is not currently documented in the official API documentation or the Swagger file. The presence of this field is due to recent changes or enhancements in the API that have not yet been reflected in the documentation. Customers have noticed this discrepancy and have requested that the documentation be updated to include information about the chargeSegments array.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling enhanced discount features in a Zuora staging tenant, and why might the feature not appear under Billing->manage features?","response":"To enable enhanced discount features in a Zuora staging tenant, the feature should typically be listed under Billing->manage features. If it does not appear there, it could be due to a T9 (tenant permission) setting issue or a misconfiguration. In some cases, the feature may be available in the UI but not accessible via API, particularly when trying to link a Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) to a discount of type 'subscription.' If the feature is missing or not functioning as expected, it is recommended to verify the tenant's T9 settings and consult with support to ensure the feature is properly enabled.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer update the custom field of a rate plan charge for a previous segment in the latest version of a subscription?","response":"A customer can update the custom field of a rate plan charge for a previous segment in the latest version of a subscription by using the appropriate API endpoint published in the subscriptions folder. Specifically, the PUT_UpdateSubscriptionCustomFieldsOfASpecifiedVersion API allows updating custom fields for a specified version and segment of a subscription's rate plan charge.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to increase the limit of 100 features per subscription product rate plan in Zuora?","response":"The limit of 100 features per subscription product rate plan in Zuora cannot be increased. This is a system-enforced limit, and attempts to add more than 100 features will result in an error. If a customer needs to add more features, they must consider removing existing features or restructuring their product offerings, as the system does not support increasing this limit.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected behavior of the 'Redistribute Zuora Tax rounding differences' billing rule setting in Subscription Preview UI and API?","response":"The 'Redistribute Zuora Tax rounding differences' billing rule setting is not applied to tax calculations in the Subscription Preview UI, particularly in the new UI. Testing has shown that the total tax amount remains the same in both the old and new UIs, indicating that this setting does not affect the preview calculation. The setting is also not a T9 permission and is not used for tax calculation in the preview UI. However, there may be differences in behavior between sandbox and production environments, so if discrepancies are observed, it is advisable to reach out to the tax team or submit a support ticket for further clarification.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer enable the ability to preview orders in closed accounting periods in Zuora?","response":"To enable the ability to preview orders in closed accounting periods, set the tenant-level property 'allow.order.preview.in.closed.ap' to TRUE. This can be done by using a specific URL to set the tenant property, replacing the property name, URL, and tenantId as appropriate. Once enabled, this allows order previews even when the accounting period is closed.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for updating the amendment number prefix in Zuora, and what issues might prevent this update?","response":"Updating the amendment number prefix in Zuora can be done through the billing settings. However, if a tenant has a large number of amendments, attempting to update the prefix may result in a 504 Gateway Timeout error due to the volume of data being processed. In such cases, the backend logic may still be processing the event even if the request times out, so it is important to double-check if the change was eventually applied. If the update fails consistently, it is recommended to create an L3 support ticket for further assistance.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer clear a picklist-type custom field value (set it to null) via the Orders API?","response":"The Orders REST API does not support clearing a picklist-type custom field by setting its value to null. As a workaround, customers can define a new option in the custom field to represent 'not selected.' Alternatively, they can use the Action_POSTupdate API, which proxies to the SOAP API and supports the 'fieldsToNull' parameter to clear custom field values. This method allows clearing the value of a custom field by specifying it in the 'fieldsToNull' array.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the maximum number of charges or rate plans allowed under a single subscription in Zuora, and is this a hard or performance limit?","response":"The maximum number of charges under a single subscription in Zuora is 200. This is considered a performance limit rather than a hard system limit. The system can technically support more than 200 charges or rate plans per subscription, but it is not recommended due to potential performance issues. Each case should be evaluated individually based on the actual order payload and usage patterns.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer update custom fields on a scheduled order in Zuora?","response":"Currently, updating custom fields on a scheduled order is only supported via the API; the UI does not support this functionality yet. This is a known limitation due to resource constraints in Orders UI engineering. As a workaround, customers can use the API or implement a workflow action to update custom fields. This limitation should be documented in the Knowledge Center, and any updates to UI support will be communicated in the future.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the retry behavior for failed scheduled orders in Zuora?","response":"There is no limit on the number of retries for a failed scheduled order in Zuora. The system will continuously retry the scheduled order until the end of the execution day, and retries will stop at 0:00 am on the next day of the tenant's local time zone. This ensures that the order has multiple chances to succeed within the same execution day.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer process multiple payments or refunds per order using the Orders API?","response":"Currently, the Orders API supports only one payment method per call. Even if 'invoiceSeparately' is set to true and multiple invoices are generated per order, only one payment can be processed per order if 'collectPayment' is true. Similarly, only one refund per order can be generated. This limitation applies regardless of the number of invoices or memos associated with the order.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling the AddOnQuantity permission for modeling ramps as add products rather than update product actions?","response":"To enable the ability to model ramps as add products rather than update product actions, the support or provisioning team needs to turn on the AddOnQuantity permission for the tenant. This is typically done in response to a customer request and may require coordination with the support team to ensure the correct permissions are enabled.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer troubleshoot why a subscription is being picked up in a Workflow export task based on a custom field value?","response":"To troubleshoot why a subscription is being picked up in a Workflow export task based on a custom field value, check all versions and segments of the subscription, including deleted versions. The query may return subscriptions where the custom field value matches in any segment, not just the latest one. If the query does not include a filter for 'isLastSegment=true,' it may return results for previous segments. Support can confirm the custom field values from the UI, and it is important to clarify the query logic with the customer to ensure it matches their expectations.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer enable the breakdown_by_order tenant property for their tenant?","response":"To enable the 'breakdown_by_order' tenant property, the customer should provide a support ticket referencing their request. The support or engineering team can then activate the setting for the specified tenant. If the request is related to invoice notifications or other features, it may be necessary to coordinate with the appropriate product team to ensure the setting is applied correctly.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for handling duplicate subscriptions created within the same order in Zuora? Can they be deleted individually?","response":"Duplicate subscriptions created within the same order cannot be deleted individually from the backend. The best practice is to delete the entire order and recreate it with the correct subscriptions. If canceled subscriptions are visible to end-users and cannot be filtered out, this approach ensures only the intended subscriptions are present. There is no supported method to delete individual duplicate subscriptions from the backend.","category":"best_practice","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer enable or verify Orders Harmonization and Orders features in their tenant if the UI is misleading?","response":"If the UI is misleading regarding the status of Orders Harmonization and Orders features, verify whether the customer can use the Orders API. If the API is accessible and functional, the features are enabled, even if the UI suggests otherwise. This is a known UI issue, and the actual enablement should be confirmed by API access rather than UI indicators.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer update the custom field of a rate plan charge for a previous segment in the latest version of a subscription?","response":"A customer can update the custom field of a rate plan charge for a previous segment in the latest version of a subscription by using the appropriate API endpoint published in the subscriptions folder. Specifically, the PUT_UpdateSubscriptionCustomFieldsOfASpecifiedVersion API allows updating custom fields for a specified version and segment of a subscription's rate plan charge.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}

{"instruction":"What is the difference between the 'Order Date' and the 'Subscription Price Update Effective Policy' in Zuora's Batch Price Update, and how do they affect the creation of new subscription versions when renewal dates differ?","response":"The 'Order Date' in Zuora is the date used for revenue booking, essentially marking when the order is recorded for financial purposes. The 'Subscription Price Update Effective Policy' determines when the new price becomes effective for the subscription. These two dates can be set to the same value or to different values, depending on business needs. For example, if one order renewal date is January 10 and another is January 15, the program will create the new version with the effective date corresponding to the specific renewal date (e.g., January 10 for the first renewal). This allows flexibility in aligning financial recognition with operational changes in pricing.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer check if the Auto Renewal Batch job is still disabled in their Zuora tenant, and is there a way for support to verify this or query it in the database?","response":"To check if the Auto Renewal Batch job is still disabled in a Zuora tenant, support can verify the status either through internal system settings or by running a query in the database using the Query UI. There is no explicit step-by-step process detailed, but it is implied that support has the tools or queries available to confirm the job's status for a given tenant.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected behavior when using the Order API to create multiple subscriptions in a single call, and how does it differ from the legacy SOAP Subscribe API in terms of transaction handling?","response":"When using the Order API to create multiple subscriptions in a single call, all operations within the order are processed as a single transaction. This means that if any operation within the order fails, the entire call is rolled back and none of the subscriptions are created. In contrast, the legacy SOAP Subscribe API (and its REST proxy) processes each record in a separate database transaction, so if one subscription creation fails, the others can still succeed. This difference is important for error handling and designing integration logic.","category":"comparison","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer enable the Order Feature in a Zuora sandbox tenant, and what are the steps or resources for self-enablement?","response":"A customer can enable the Order Feature in their Zuora sandbox tenant by using the Feature Manager page in the Zuora UI. This self-enablement process is documented in the Zuora Knowledge Center, specifically under the section for enabling billing features by yourself. The customer should navigate to the Feature Manager, locate the Order Feature, and enable it as needed. If further guidance is required, the Knowledge Center provides step-by-step instructions.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the cause and resolution for the error 'Please provide one identifier among chargeNumber, uniqueToken, productRatePlanChargeNumber, productRatePlanChargeId' when updating a scheduled order via the API, and what should be checked in the payload?","response":"This error occurs when updating a scheduled order via the API and the payload does not specify an identifier for the charge to be updated. The required identifiers include chargeNumber, uniqueToken, productRatePlanChargeNumber, or productRatePlanChargeId. To resolve the error, ensure that the chargeUpdate section of the payload includes one of these identifiers. If the identifier is provided but a locking contention error occurs, further investigation is needed, such as checking processId or request_id, and confirming the environment and timing of the requests. If the error persists every time, it is likely due to an incorrect payload, such as missing the charge number in the chargeUpdate section. Clarify with the customer which charge they intend to update and ensure the payload is constructed accordingly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the current status and future plan for supporting preview capabilities for scheduled orders in Zuora, including before and after creation, and is there any support for this in CPQ?","response":"Currently, Zuora does not support previewing scheduled orders after they have been created. The order preview API only supports previewing an order before it is created. There are plans to support previewing individual scheduled orders before creation via the Orders API in Q2 2025, but this timeline is subject to change. For requirements such as previewing billing including all scheduled orders within a target date, Zuora is collecting more requirements and may consider this for future development. For CPQ, support for scheduled orders during quote creation is not currently available, and customers are advised to contact the product manager for updates on this feature.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer test auto-renewals with scheduled orders in Zuora without waiting for the scheduled execution date, and what are the current limitations or workarounds?","response":"Currently, there is no way to execute a scheduled order on the same day in Zuora. All scheduled orders across tenants are placed into a single queue starting at midnight, and are executed one by one, so there is no guarantee when a specific tenant's scheduled orders will be processed. For testing purposes, customers can use dates in the past to trigger the renewal immediately. Another suggestion is to orchestrate scheduled orders with bill runs, similar to how auto-renewals can be triggered in a bill run, but this is not yet available. Allowing arbitrary execution of scheduled orders could cause data integrity issues, so any such testing feature would likely be limited to sandbox environments.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer export the owner transfer history of a subscription, including previous and current owners, using Zuora reporting?","response":"To export the owner transfer history of a subscription, including previous and current owners, customers should use the 'subscription Creator Account ID' and 'Creator Invoice Owner ID' fields in their report. These fields represent the owner for each version of the subscription, allowing tracking of ownership changes over time.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended Zuora Orders API version for new integrations, and why?","response":"The recommended Zuora Orders API version for new integrations is v1. The v1 API is actively updated with the newest features and functionalities, while the v2 API is no longer recommended for newly integrated customers. Therefore, customers should continue to use and recommend the v1 API for all new integrations.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling the 'ScheduledOrder' feature in Zuora, and is any special permission required?","response":"The 'ScheduledOrder' feature in Zuora is now generally available (GA) and does not require any special permission or hidden URL to enable. Customers can use this feature directly without additional enablement steps.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer check if the 'cancelReason' for a scheduled order cancellation is stored and retrievable, and what is the current or planned support for accessing this field via data query or API?","response":"The 'cancelReason' entered when cancelling a scheduled order is stored on the order model. However, as of the latest updates, this field is not yet exposed in the data source or data query for orders, though it is available for the subscription object. There are plans to expose 'cancelReason' for orders in data source and data query in an upcoming Q1 release. The UI fix to display the cancel reason is scheduled to be deployed soon, and the field will be available in the API response for orders.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the system limit for the number of subscriptions that can be created in a single Order API call (synchronous and asynchronous), and what are the recommended approaches for large orders?","response":"The system limit for creating subscriptions in a single synchronous Order API call is 50 subscriptions. For asynchronous calls, the limit is 300 subscriptions. These are hard system limits and cannot be changed for individual customers. For large orders, it is recommended to split the order into multiple asynchronous calls, each with up to 250 subscriptions, to stay within the limits and optimize performance. Additionally, enabling the reseller account feature can help address lock contention issues when making concurrent API calls to the same customer account, but it does not increase the per-call subscription limit.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer enable the 'Adding a subset of charges' feature for early adopters, and what permissions or settings are required?","response":"To enable the 'Adding a subset of charges' feature for early adopters, the 'EnableAddingSubsetCharges' permission must be enabled via a hidden URL. This is not controlled by a T9 setting but by permission control. It is important not to enable the 'singleVersion subscription' feature for existing customers without product management approval, as this can cause conflicts. Only the 'EnableAddingSubsetCharges' permission should be enabled for this feature.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer check if the 'OrderActionRatePlan' object is available in AQuA, and what alternatives exist for accessing this data?","response":"The 'OrderActionRatePlan' object is not exposed in AQuA. However, it is available in Data Query, so customers should use Data Query to access information from the 'OrderActionRatePlan' object.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for troubleshooting discrepancies in included units between the RatePlanCharge data source and the subscription UI, and which data source should be used for accurate reporting?","response":"Discrepancies in included units between the RatePlanCharge data source and the subscription UI can occur because the 'Included Units' value is not on the RatePlanCharge model but on the RatePlanChargeTier. For accurate reporting of included units, customers should use the RatePlanChargeTier data source instead of RatePlanCharge. This ensures that the reported values match what is displayed in the subscription UI.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer check if the 'Auto Renewal Batch' job is disabled in their tenant, and what tools or queries are available for support to verify this?","response":"Support can check if the 'Auto Renewal Batch' job is disabled in a tenant by using internal system settings or by running a query in the database through the Query UI. There is no detailed step-by-step process provided, but support has the necessary tools or queries to confirm the job's status for a specific tenant.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling or disabling Order Harmonization (OH) or Orders in a Zuora tenant, and what considerations should be taken into account?","response":"Enabling or disabling Order Harmonization (OH) or Orders in a Zuora tenant depends on the tenant's current status and customer requirements. For new tenants, Orders is enabled by default. For existing tenants, OH is typically enabled first, especially if the customer is transitioning from Subscribe & Amend (S/A). Full Orders should not be enabled directly unless the customer has no S/A integrations and has tested the functionality in a sandbox environment. Disabling OH or reverting to pure Orders may require support intervention and is generally only done if there are no pending amendments or S/A traffic. Coordination with product management and support is recommended to avoid data integrity issues.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer retrieve the request payload for a specific order in Zuora if the original API request is not logged?","response":"If the original API request for an order is not logged, customers can use the 'get order' API to retrieve the order's response, which includes the creation order payload information. By removing the order metrics section from the response, the remaining data represents the payload used to create the order. This approach allows customers to reconstruct the original request for reference or troubleshooting.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for updating the term type of a subscription from TERM to EVERGREEN using the create order API, and what fields should be used?","response":"To update the term type of a subscription from TERM to EVERGREEN using the create order API, the correct field to use is 'termType' set to 'EVERGREEN'. The 'lastTerm' field is not appropriate for this operation. The update can also be performed using the PUT /subscriptions/{subscriptionId} API call with 'termType' set to 'EVERGREEN'.","category":"procedural","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer check if the 'Invoice Group Number' field has character limitations, and what characters are allowed?","response":"The 'Invoice Group Number' field in Zuora should use normal characters such as numbers (1-9), uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), hyphens (-), and plus signs (+). Special characters like slashes (/) and backslashes (\\) should be avoided. There is no explicit character limit mentioned, but using only the allowed characters ensures compatibility.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer retrieve the net quantity change for an order item in Zuora, and what fields or metrics should be used in the latest order delta metrics?","response":"The deprecated 'Order Item' table had a 'quantity' field that provided the net change associated with order actions. In the latest order delta metrics, customers should use the 'order quantity metrics' value field to track net changes. This field provides the net quantity changes when any order action is made on rate plan charges' quantity. Order MRR was already recommended, but for cases where MRR is zero (such as auto-renewed termed subscriptions with end-of-term changes), the order quantity metrics field is valuable for tracking net quantity changes.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for troubleshooting missing subscription versions in the Net MRR by account report, and what factors should be checked?","response":"If subscription versions are missing in the Net MRR by account report, first verify that all filters have been removed from the report. If the issue persists, compare the results in the UI with the report to identify which versions are missing. Check if the missing versions carry MRR for recurring charges. If the report still does not display all versions, further investigation may be needed, such as checking the report configuration or consulting with senior support. Access to the customer's tenant may be required to build and verify the report directly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer check if the 'Order Item' data object is deprecated and what alternatives exist for tracking net quantity changes in order actions?","response":"The 'Order Item' data object is deprecated in Zuora. For tracking net quantity changes in order actions, customers should use the 'order quantity metrics' value field in the latest order delta metrics. This field provides the net changes associated with order actions on rate plan charges' quantity, serving as a replacement for the deprecated 'Order Item' quantity field.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for troubleshooting a report that does not display all subscription versions or statuses as expected, and what steps should be taken?","response":"To troubleshoot a report that does not display all subscription versions or statuses as expected, first remove any filters from the report and verify the results. If versions are still missing, compare the report output with the UI to identify discrepancies. Check if the missing versions have relevant data such as MRR for recurring charges. If the issue persists, consult with senior support or build the same report directly in the customer's tenant to investigate further.

{"instruction":"What is the process for troubleshooting a workflow export task that takes significantly longer than usual to complete, and what steps should be taken?","response":"If a workflow export task takes significantly longer than usual to complete, first check if there have been any recent changes to the workflow. Review the workflow run history and identify any failed query request IDs. Compare the execution times of recent runs to identify anomalies. If the issue persists and is not related to workflow changes, check for any related incidents or errors in the logs. If necessary, create an L3 ticket for further investigation by engineering.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer check if the 'Order Date' and 'Subscription Price Update Effective Policy' can be set to different values, and what is the impact of doing so?","response":"In Zuora, the 'Order Date' (used for revenue booking) and the 'Subscription Price Update Effective Policy' (which determines when the new price is effective) can be set to the same or different values. Setting them to different values allows flexibility in aligning financial recognition with operational changes in pricing. For example, if renewal dates differ, the program will create the new version with the effective date matching the specific renewal date, allowing for precise control over when pricing changes take effect.","category":"definitional","topic":"orders"}

{"instruction":"How can I find the audit trail for the setting 'Enable Orders UI'?","response":"There is no direct answer or detailed procedure provided for finding the audit trail for the 'Enable Orders UI' setting. However, a related discussion suggests that enabling the Orders UI can be done via a hidden URL or through the UI, and issues with enablement may be logged in Kibana. If you need to track changes to this setting, you may need to check system logs or consult with support for audit capabilities.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders"}
{"instruction":"What value should be passed in the relatedSubscriptionNumber field to link order line items to a subscription that is yet to be created, and what is the current workaround?","response":"Currently, you cannot link an Order Line Item (OLI) to a subscription that is yet to be created using the standard approach. The documentation may suggest passing the same value in relatedSubscriptionNumber and subscriptionNumber, but this does not work unless you use a customized subscription number. As a workaround, you can specify a customized subscription number in the createSubscription order action and use that same value in relatedSubscriptionNumber. This works both in the UI and via API. If you need a sample payload, you can specify a customized subscription number like 'A-S001' in both fields. This solution is available now, but an enhancement to support auto-generated subscription numbers is planned for Q4.","category":"procedural","topic":"linking order line items to new subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How is the display order of custom fields in the subscription UI determined?","response":"The display order of custom fields in the subscription UI is determined alphabetically and numerically. This means that custom fields are shown in order based on their names, following both alphabetical and numerical sorting.","category":"definitional","topic":"custom field display order"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer extract Subscription, Rate Plan, Rate Plan Charge, and Rate Plan Charge Tier details for a Scheduled Order if the subscriptionId is not available?","response":"If the subscriptionId is not available on the scheduled order, it is not possible to use the standard APIs to filter and extract Subscription, Rate Plan, Rate Plan Charge, and Rate Plan Charge Tier details, as these APIs require subscriptionId or other filterable fields. There is no documented alternate method provided for extracting these details for scheduled orders without the subscriptionId.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"extracting details for scheduled orders"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limitation or required change when creating a scheduled order using v2/orders API with an updated price amount, if the order does not reflect the specified amount?","response":"If a scheduled order created using the v2/orders API does not reflect the updated price amount, it may be due to a limitation or bug in the v2 API. Switching to the v1 API resolves the issue, but this may not be a viable option for all customers due to the need for re-implementation and re-testing. The issue appears to have started at a specific time and is blocking pre-production testing. The v2 API may not set the new price in the payload, and it relies on v1. This is likely a v2 API bug, and reproducing the issue in a test tenant or involving the SDK team is recommended for further troubleshooting.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"scheduled order price update via v2/orders API"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to exclude usage charges from an order preview or to pull the invoice-level amount for an upcoming invoice without line-level amounts?","response":"Currently, the Order Preview API cannot exclude usage charges or filter out charges by charge type or model. There is an existing roadmap item to enhance this functionality, but there is no exact ETA. If this performance issue is blocking production operations, engineering can be involved for short-term analysis, but otherwise, the enhancement will be productized in the future.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"order preview usage charge exclusion"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to 'turn off' Order Harmonization (OH) for customers who have migrated all integrations to Orders, and what is the process?","response":"Yes, it is possible to disable OH and move customers to a pure Orders tenant. The process involves confirming that the customer has fully tested the migration and determining if they are OTR customers. There is a suggestion to develop a process to automatically convert tenants to full Orders if no subscribe/amend calls have been made in the last 60 or 90 days. Internal tracking is needed to ensure customers are no longer just on OH, and the customer should not need to request this change.","category":"procedural","topic":"disabling Order Harmonization after Orders migration"}
{"instruction":"Why do Orders APIs accept only account number (not account ID) as the identifier, and what are the implications for customers migrating from subscribe/amend integrations?","response":"Orders APIs are designed to use account number as the identifier because it is a natural key that can be set and edited according to customer requirements, and it carries more business meaning than a UUID account ID. This design choice makes the account number easier to remember and more meaningful for business processes. For customers migrating from subscribe/amend integrations that use account ID, this means they may need to add an extra API call to retrieve the account number before creating a subscription via the Orders API. This can add complexity to integrations, especially if multiple external systems rely on the account ID.","category":"definitional","topic":"Orders API account identifier design"}
{"instruction":"Why can't customers define a custom prefix for Orders, while they can for amendments and invoices?","response":"Currently, the system order prefix is 'O-' and it is not allowed to modify this prefix. The reason for this restriction is not explicitly stated, but it is noted that customers can set their own prefixes for amendments and invoices, which is why they are asking for similar functionality for Orders. There is no current support for custom order prefixes.","category":"definitional","topic":"order prefix customization"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer find the linked subscription number with a scheduled order number (not through the UI)?","response":"To find the subscription number linked to a scheduled order number, the subscription number is included in the retrieve order response. Customers can use the retrieve order API to obtain this information, as the subscription number will be present in the response for the scheduled order.","category":"procedural","topic":"finding subscription number from scheduled order"}
{"instruction":"What is the amendment quote limitation for Orders, and how does it compare to Subscribe/Amend (S/A)?","response":"For Orders, the limit is on the number of order actions in an amendment quote, which is 50. In Subscribe/Amend (S/A), the limit was 10 but could be changed to 30. The limitation for Orders is higher, allowing more actions per quote.","category":"definitional","topic":"amendment quote limits in Orders vs S/A"}
{"instruction":"What is the status of UI performance improvements for subscriptions with more than 500 Rate Plan Charges (RPC), and is there a limitation on the number of amendments allowed on a subscription?","response":"UI performance improvements for subscriptions with more than 500 RPC are still on the back burner and not yet addressed. There is a limitation that only 1000 amendments are allowed on a subscription. There is no current enhancement to ease this limitation, and further details about the customer's use case are needed to consider changes.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"UI performance and amendment limits for large subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"What is the relationship between Subscription and Order objects in Zuora, and why is there a discrepancy between AQUA and Data Query APIs regarding the OrderID field?","response":"The relationship between Subscription and Order objects is one-to-many, as multiple orders can update a subscription. In Data Query APIs, the Subscription object includes an OrderID field, which links the two, but in AQUA APIs, there is no direct link provided. This discrepancy exists because AQuA is designed for large extractions and skips intermediate tables, and it was live before the Orders module was released. The OrderID field in Data Query may act as a shortcut or metadata, but it is not always present for all order actions. The correct way to link is through Order Actions, where OrderAction.SubscriptionId = Subscription.Id.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription and Order object relationship"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to enable Payment Terms at the Order Line Item (OLI) level when using the Flexible Billing feature?","response":"With the support of the Flexible Billing feature, the OLI functionality has been enhanced to allow Payment Terms to be set at the Order Line Item level. This enhancement is available via API only at the current stage and is already deployed to production and SBX environments. The API documentation and release notes have been updated to reflect this change.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Flexible Billing and OLI payment terms"}
{"instruction":"How does the Scheduled Orders feature work in terms of API usage, and can scheduled orders be amended before execution?","response":"When a customer creates a scheduled order, the order payload is essentially put 'in queue' to be executed through the standard Orders API at a specific time. There is not a separate set of calls or workflow for scheduled orders; the same APIs are used as for non-scheduled orders. Scheduled orders cannot be edited in the UI currently, but they can be edited through the API using the PUT /order endpoint.","category":"definitional","topic":"Scheduled Orders API behavior and editing"}
{"instruction":"How can I enable the 'Support different invoice owner accounts for subscriptions in same order' feature in a sandbox tenant?","response":"This feature is controlled by a tenant property called ORDER_MULTI_INVOICE_OWNER_ENABLED.

{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling or disabling Orders and related settings in a tenant, and what are the implications for new tenants?","response":"For new tenants, Orders is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. The visibility of order settings is controlled by specific permissions, such as BasicOrderFunction. For existing tenants, enabling or disabling Orders or related features (like Order Harmonization) may require support or provisioning team intervention. If a tenant is a pure Orders tenant, Orders UI cannot be disabled. For tenants that need to match production settings, enabling Order Harmonization may be necessary.","category":"procedural","topic":"enabling/disabling Orders and settings in tenants"}
{"instruction":"How can I define the start and end date and have Zuora derive the term length using these fields?","response":"There is a question about whether Zuora can derive the term length from the start and end date fields, but no explicit answer is provided. This may require further investigation or confirmation from product documentation.","category":"definitional","topic":"term length derivation from start/end dates"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'Prepayment' option work in Zuora, and is it related to the Prepaid With Drawdown charge?","response":"The 'Prepayment' option is used for the Prepaid Cash feature and is not related to the Prepaid With Drawdown permission. These are separate features.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepayment option vs Prepaid With Drawdown"}

{"instruction":"How does the 'Auto-Renew By Order' setting affect the order date used in auto renewals done by bill runs, and what is the intended behavior?","response":"The 'Auto-Renew By Order' setting dictates the order date used in auto renewals performed by bill runs. When set to 'No', the order date equals the bill run execution date. This setting impacts revenue booking date, and customers should configure it according to their expectations. The default logic for order date in automated or API-initiated orders can cause issues if not set as intended, especially when amendments are made after a period is closed. The original order date may not be suitable for all scenarios, and the default behavior should be reviewed for each use case.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Auto-Renew By Order setting and order date logic"}
{"instruction":"How can I enable 'Single Version Subscription' for a tenant, and what are the requirements?","response":"'Single Version Subscription' is not enabled for existing tenants by default. To enable it, ensure the tenant is a full Orders tenant (not Order Harmonization), and then enable the SingleVersion permission. This is typically done for new subscriptions only, and support or provisioning may need to assist with the enablement process.","category":"procedural","topic":"enabling Single Version Subscription"}
{"instruction":"Why does the billing preview not show after editing the subscription name in an order, and is this expected behavior?","response":"If you create an order to create a subscription, then edit the subscription name before clicking Billing Preview, the preview may not show. However, if you do not edit the name, the preview works. To see the billing preview after editing the name, you may need to cancel the order and start over. The reason for this behavior is not explicitly stated, but it may be a limitation or bug in the current implementation.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"billing preview after editing subscription name"}
{"instruction":"Does Fulfillment support notifications, and what are the requirements for triggering fulfillment notifications?","response":"Fulfillment supports notifications via custom events, but there must be a correlation between the account and fulfillment for the event to trigger. The notification must be enabled on the communication profile, and the default profile is used if no others are defined. If the event does not trigger, check that the fulfillment notification is enabled on the correct communication profile and confirm with the notification team if issues persist.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"fulfillment notifications"}
{"instruction":"Can I set different invoice owner accounts for subscriptions in the same order via API or UI, and what is the current behavior for Order Line Items (OLI)?","response":"You cannot set a different invoice owner account on an OLI via API; only the OLI owner account can be set. In the UI, the invoice owner account is read-only, and the OLI owner account is editable. The invoice owner is the same as the subscription/order owner, and you only need to set the owner account for the OLI.","category":"definitional","topic":"invoice owner vs OLI owner in orders"}
{"instruction":"Can we create PPDD (Prepaid with Drawdown) charges with standalone orders?","response":"Currently, creating PPDD charges with standalone orders is not fully supported.

{"instruction":"Can the 'contractRecognizedRevenueAccountingCode' of a charge be overridden when instantiating it from the catalogue, or only during standalone order creation?","response":"It appears that the 'contractRecognizedRevenueAccountingCode' can only be overridden during standalone order creation, not when instantiating a charge from the catalogue. The documentation suggests this limitation.","category":"definitional","topic":"overriding contractRecognizedRevenueAccountingCode"}
{"instruction":"How can I enable Order Delta Metrics for a tenant, and is data migration required?","response":"If a tenant has been on Orders from the beginning and neither Order Metrics nor Order Delta Metrics is enabled, you can enable Order Delta Metrics directly. If historical data is needed, a migration process can be performed after enabling the feature. For tenants that recently switched to Order Harmonization, migration may be necessary to generate metrics for historical data.","category":"procedural","topic":"enabling Order Delta Metrics and data migration"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for troubleshooting slow page loads or timeouts when accessing a subscription in the UI?","response":"If a subscription page loads slowly or times out, check if the issue is reproducible and whether it affects only one subscription. Performance issues may be caused by features like Lifecycle. Providing a HAR file for both successful and failed cases can help diagnose the problem. UI-side performance fixes may be required, and further investigation by engineering may be needed.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"UI performance troubleshooting for subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"What is the warning message when deleting an amendment of type 'Renew', and is it safe to proceed?","response":"A warning message may be displayed when trying to delete an amendment of type 'Renew' if the 'Note' field for the latest subscription version is not empty and matches the base subscription. This is due to a bug in the code. However, it is safe to delete the amendment without any impact. A ticket has been created to address the bug.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"deleting renew amendments and warning messages"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'split_segment_by_term' tenant property affect subscription renewals and TCV calculation, and how can it be enabled or disabled?","response":"When 'split_segment_by_term' is set to true, renewing a subscription splits the charge segment, which is required by Zuora Revenue. If the customer does not use Zuora Revenue, this setting may have been enabled by mistake. Only support can enable or disable this property. The TCV value in Subscription Product & Charge may behave differently depending on this setting.

{"instruction":"How can customers check their Revenue volume usage in Zuora, similar to how they check Billing volume usage?","response":"There is no direct customer-facing method or UI in Zuora Revenue that allows customers to check their Revenue volume usage in the same way as Billing volume usage. While instructions and reference materials exist for Billing volume usage, there is currently no equivalent for Revenue. Customers experiencing discrepancies between Billing and Revenue amounts should consult with their Zuora contacts for alternative approaches or documentation, as no standard UI or process is available for Revenue volume usage verification.","category":"definitional","topic":"Revenue volume usage verification"}
{"instruction":"What is the data retention period for Grafana dashboards connected to Zuora's Pinot database, and does data purge after a certain number of days?","response":"Grafana dashboards that use Zuora's Pinot database typically retain data for about 90 to 100 days. Attempts to retrieve data older than this period will result in no data being returned. This aligns with observed behavior and internal confirmation that the Pinot database, which underlies Grafana, purges data after approximately 90 or 99 days.","category":"definitional","topic":"Grafana data retention"}
{"instruction":"Is there an upper limit to the number of records in the Dynamic Pricing Decision Table in Zuora, and what are the practical considerations?","response":"There is no strict upper limit to the number of records in the Dynamic Pricing (DP) Decision Table. Successful tests have been conducted with up to 1,000 rows and 10 attributes. However, errors have been encountered when exceeding this number, particularly from ZRules when saving data. Additionally, if the table exceeds 10,000 cells, it is recommended to reevaluate the use case and consider simplifying the pricing structure, as managing such a large number of price points may not be practical.","category":"definitional","topic":"Dynamic Pricing Decision Table limits"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between MO (Billing) and MO (Revenue) entitlements in Zuora, and does purchasing one require the other?","response":"MO (Billing) and MO (Revenue) are distinct entitlements in Zuora. Purchasing MO (Billing) does not necessitate purchasing MO (Revenue), and vice versa. Each serves a different purpose and outcome. Unlike older products where both components were required, these entitlements are independent. A Revenue Advisor can help determine if MO (Revenue) is needed for a specific use case.","category":"definitional","topic":"MO Billing vs MO Revenue entitlements"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer implement a price increase in Zuora for existing subscribers, and what are some troubleshooting tips if the new pricing does not apply after renewal?","response":"To implement a price increase for existing subscribers in Zuora, update the price settings before the renewal date. If, after renewing a subscription, the old pricing still applies, ensure that the price update was made effective before the renewal action. Batch price updates can be performed on the desired date. The option to update prices is available from the main Zuora Billing view or via the subscription menu. If the new pricing is not reflected, double-check the timing and method of the update. In some cases, a batch update after the renewal date may be simpler. If issues persist, reviewing the steps taken and consulting Zuora support or documentation is recommended.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Price increase implementation for existing subscribers"}
{"instruction":"What documentation or slide decks about the new Zuora catalog can be shared with customers, and what should remain internal?","response":"Public documentation about the new Zuora catalog is approved for sharing with customers. The long user guide should remain internal. Slides 8-13 from the enablement deck are suitable for external sharing, with slide 9 requiring safe harbor language. A demo on Terra's landing page is also appropriate to share. Dedicated external-approved slides are being prepared for broader customer use. For the most up-to-date and externally approved materials, check the landing page or coordinate with the enablement team.","category":"procedural","topic":"Customer-facing catalog documentation"}
{"instruction":"What is the maximum number of payment gateways that can be configured in a single Zuora tenant, and how does this apply in a multi-org setup?","response":"There is no hard limit on the number of payment gateways that can be configured in a single Zuora tenant; customers have configured over 150 gateways, including more than 150 Adyen merchant IDs, without issue. In a multi-org (MO) setup, gateways are shared among orgs, and the limit is the same as in non-MO environments. The restriction is based on the number of unique gateway types, not instances. For example, multiple Adyen gateways with different merchant IDs count as one gateway type. The actual number allowed may depend on the customer's contract and modules, but having hundreds or even thousands of gateway instances is not unprecedented.","category":"definitional","topic":"Zuora payment gateway limits"}
{"instruction":"How can Zuora Mediation be used as a single platform for usage that is billed out of multiple billing systems, and are there additional costs based on the target system?","response":"Zuora Mediation can be set up with separate external targets (such as Amazon S3, Snowflake, or Kafka) to send usage data to other billing systems. Any target that exports data out of Zuora's systems incurs additional data transfer costs for Zuora, but customers are not charged based on the complexity of the meter or the specific sources/targets used. Charges are based solely on the number of events ingested. Engineering involvement is required to configure and secure external targets. Additionally, a new HTTP processor is being developed (currently in EA) to allow sending rated or mediated events to external systems, with general availability expected next quarter.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Mediation for multi-billing system usage"}
{"instruction":"What are the performance benchmarks and best practices for using Performance Booster Elite (PBE) in Zuora to process large invoice volumes?","response":"Performance Booster Elite (PBE) has been benchmarked to process approximately 2 million invoices in 5 hours under optimal conditions (simple subscriptions with one rate plan). For more complex subscriptions, performance may be lower. Processing 20 million invoices could take about 50 hours. It is recommended to distribute invoice generation over 2-3 days rather than attempting to process all at once. Anniversary subscriptions help distribute load spikes. PBE is intended for production environments, but customers wishing to test in sandbox (SBX) must purchase an additional license or conduct performance tests in production.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Performance Booster Elite (PBE) benchmarks"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer determine if they are on Invoice Settlement (IS) in Zuora, and why might they not see 'Credit Memo' as a data source when creating a report?","response":"To determine if a customer is on Invoice Settlement (IS), check the left side of the Overview screen in the Production tenant box in Cerebro. If they are not on IS, 'Credit Memo' will not be available as a data source when creating a new report, regardless of permissions. Only customers with IS enabled can access credit memo fields in reporting.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Invoice Settlement and Credit Memo reporting"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'maintenance mode' and 'end of life' (EOL) for Zuora features like Subscribe and Amend, and what should customers do if they receive a maintenance mode notice?","response":"When a Zuora feature enters 'maintenance mode,' it remains available but will only receive fixes for critical, revenue-impacting defects with no workarounds, at Zuora's discretion. No new enhancements will be made. 'End of life' (EOL) means Zuora will actively move customers off the feature, typically providing 12-18 months' notice and possibly a replacement feature. Customers receiving a maintenance mode notice for Subscribe and Amend (S&A) are advised to transition to Orders Harmonization and related APIs as they see value in adopting new features. There is no immediate risk if the customer is not ready to adopt, but future enhancements will only be available in the new feature set.","category":"definitional","topic":"Maintenance mode vs EOL for Zuora features"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer export a list of tables, fields, and field types from Snowflake that are pushed from Zuora, and what is the best way to demonstrate field parity for fit-gap analysis?","response":"To export a list of tables, fields, and field types from Snowflake that are pushed from Zuora, use the demo or OTR Snowflake instance to display the data and perform an export on the same object shown in Zuora. This allows for a direct comparison to demonstrate that fields and types are consistent between systems. For fit-gap analysis, showing the full field definition within Snowflake helps customers understand the effort required to migrate reporting from their current ETL solution to using secure share.","category":"procedural","topic":"Snowflake field export and fit-gap analysis"}
{"instruction":"What are the current capabilities and limitations of Zuora's Workday (WDAY) integration, specifically regarding detailed transaction-level data versus summary journal entries?","response":"Currently, Zuora's Workday integration primarily supports exporting summary journal entries (JE) from both billing and revenue. The connector does not support detailed transaction-level integration (such as account or invoice data) as of the last release. Transactional data integration to Prism or Accounting Center is still in the design phase. Some customers are building detailed integrations using their own frameworks, but this is not natively supported by the connector at this time.","category":"definitional","topic":"Zuora Workday integration capabilities"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for obtaining the latest SOC 1 report and bridge letter from Zuora, and what are the limitations regarding timing and coverage?","response":"To obtain the latest SOC 1 report, submit a request through the appropriate internal channels (such as Zoe with the IT team or rfp-team@zuora.com). Bridge letters are published 1-2 weeks after the end of each quarter and cannot be created for future periods. All SOC reports and bridge letters cover past periods only, and audit periods are fixed (e.g., a full year). If a customer requires a new SOC report in April, Zuora can provide a signed Letter of Engagement from the external auditor in mid-April, but cannot provide a draft report. Management statements can also be provided. The process and timing cannot be adjusted to cover partial or future periods.","category":"procedural","topic":"SOC 1 report and bridge letter process"}
{"instruction":"What are the differences between Payment Links, Payment Forms, and Payment Pages in Zuora, and can they be used together?","response":"Payment Links, Payment Forms, and Payment Pages are all PCI-compliant and secure options for capturing payments in Zuora. They are not mutually exclusive and can be used in parallel for different use cases or customer segments. Payment Links are a newer option, while Payment Forms and Payment Pages are more traditional methods for card capture during sign-up flows. Customers may implement multiple options simultaneously to address various business needs.","category":"comparison","topic":"Payment Links vs Forms vs Pages"}
{"instruction":"How can Zuora Mediation send rated or mediated events to external systems, and what is the status of the HTTP processor feature?","response":"Zuora Mediation can send rated or mediated events to external systems using external targets such as Amazon S3, Snowflake, or Kafka. A new HTTP processor feature is in early access (EA) and will allow sending events to external systems via HTTP. This feature is currently under development and is expected to become generally available in the next quarter.","category":"procedural","topic":"Mediation external targets and HTTP processor"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer set up an Amex PMU in Zuora, and are there known customers or contacts who have done this?","response":"To set up an Amex PMU (Payment Method Updater) in Zuora, it is recommended to reach out to internal contacts who have experience with this setup. Docusign is known to use Amex PMU, and contacts such as Ben Winterroth and Melissa McDonald may be able to provide guidance or a point of contact at Amex. Checking with these individuals can help facilitate the setup process for other customers.","category":"procedural","topic":"Amex PMU setup and contacts"}
{"instruction":"What are the considerations and best practices for handling auto-renewal jobs in Zuora to avoid a window where subscriptions appear expired and allow unintended new purchases?","response":"When auto-renewal jobs run at a set time (e.g., 2am ET), there may be a window where subscriptions are technically expired in Zuora, allowing customers to submit new subscriptions that conflict with business logic. This scenario is best handled on the application side by maintaining a temporary 'active' status for customers during the pending auto-renewal window. Zuora does not provide built-in logic to address this timing issue, so custom application logic is recommended to prevent unintended new purchases during this period.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Auto-renewal timing and subscription status"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and automation options for handling dunning, suspend/resume, and cancel processes in Zuora, and how can these be implemented for customers struggling with custom workflows?","response":"Best practices for handling dunning, suspend/resume, and cancel processes in Zuora involve leveraging batch jobs and workflow automation. A typical approach is to use a batch job to pull all open, unprocessed invoices and sort them into aging buckets. Appropriate actions—such as suspending, canceling, or resuming subscriptions—are then taken based on the aging status. Zuora provides many pre-built workflows (WFs) for these purposes, and there are Functional Design Documents (FDD) and Technical Design Documents (TDD) available for reference (e.g., Staples Dunning WF). Another key aspect is to automate the cleanup of invoices that were in dunning but have since been paid. Customers are encouraged to use these workflows to ensure their processes are both efficient and aligned with Zuora's platform capabilities.","category":"best_practice","topic":"dunning and automation in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer migrate a subscription mid-billing period into Zuora without causing duplicate charges or incorrect revenue recognition, and what are the key considerations for this process?","response":"To migrate a subscription mid-billing period into Zuora without causing duplicate charges or incorrect revenue recognition, use the 'Import Subscription' order action and the 'Catch up bill run' approach. Load the subscription with the original start date or the start date of the last term/annual invoice, then use a catch up bill run to set the billed-through date to the next planned billing date. This ensures Zuora does not generate a prorated invoice for the period already billed outside Zuora. For revenue recognition, if using billing-based revenue, revenue before and including the migration day is not recognized in Zuora, while revenue after the migration day is. If a subscription is retroactively cancelled before the first Zuora billing day, no credit memo is created; otherwise, a manual credit memo may be needed. Avoiding prorated invoices is key, and manual intervention may be required for edge cases.","category":"procedural","topic":"mid-term subscription migration"}
{"instruction":"What are the limitations and alternatives for using payment schedules with multi-currency accounts in Zuora, and how should customers approach payment plans in this context?","response":"Payment schedules in Zuora are not compatible with the 'multiple currencies' feature, which allows multiple currencies on the same customer account. If a customer only needs a single currency per account, payment schedules can be used. However, if multiple currencies are required on the same account, payment schedules must be disabled. Customers can still use different currencies by creating separate accounts for each currency. The limitation exists primarily due to prioritization of other features, not technical impossibility. Customers should carefully assess whether they truly need multiple currencies on a single account or if single-currency accounts suffice for their payment plan needs.","category":"definitional","topic":"payment schedules and multi-currency"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for migrating Zuora CPQ configurations, metadata, and customizations to a new Salesforce org during a divestiture, and what are the key challenges?","response":"Migrating Zuora CPQ configurations, metadata, and customizations to a new Salesforce org during a divestiture generally follows Salesforce's standard process for moving managed packages and data. Settings and configurations are typically moved from a sandbox to production, but moving from one production Salesforce org to another is not directly supported. Customers must also determine which Salesforce accounts and related data will stay with each company. Tools like Copado can help move data and configuration between Salesforce tenants, but there is no 'clone and purge' approach across orgs. The migration of Zuora Quotes must follow the Salesforce motion as a managed package, and all data tagging for migrating accounts, contacts, etc., must be handled as part of the broader Salesforce migration strategy.","category":"procedural","topic":"Zuora CPQ migration during divestiture"}
{"instruction":"What are the key differences between Zuora CPQ and Salesforce CPQ, and is there a customer-facing slide or resource that highlights these distinctions?","response":"There is a customer-facing slide (Slide 14 in a referenced deck from Dec 2023) that provides a high-level comparison between Zuora CPQ and Salesforce CPQ. The key differences include how each handles complex subscription management, contract modifications, and integration with billing and revenue processes. Zuora CPQ is designed for dynamic, recurring revenue models and offers native integration with Zuora Billing and Revenue, while Salesforce CPQ may require more customization for similar use cases. Customers are encouraged to review the latest enablement content for detailed, up-to-date comparisons.","category":"comparison","topic":"Zuora CPQ vs Salesforce CPQ"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer determine if payment methods are stored in Zuora or if tokenization is used, and what tools or indicators are available for this assessment?","response":"To determine if a customer is storing payment methods in Zuora or using tokenization, check for Hosted Payment Method (HPM) usage, which is a straightforward indicator. Additionally, reviewing Grafana dashboards for execution of the RSA signature API (POST /v1/rsa-signatures) can indicate HPM usage; absence of this API call may suggest Hosted Payment Form (HPF) or other methods. For HPF, look for its specific API calls. If you have access to the tenant, you can directly inspect how payment data is stored. These methods help distinguish between payment methods stored in Zuora and those managed via tokenization or external vaults.","category":"procedural","topic":"payment method storage assessment"}
{"instruction":"What is the process and best practice for upgrading a customer from the legacy Zuora 360 connector to the new Salesforce Connector, and what considerations should be taken into account?","response":"The recommended process for upgrading from the legacy Zuora 360 connector to the new Salesforce Connector involves several steps: (1) Always test the upgrade in a sandbox environment first. (2) If the customer has never been enabled before, request support to enable the Object Enablement page. (3) Navigate to Settings > Commerce > Sync Object Enablement and select only the objects needed for the business use case, as syncing more objects increases API load on Salesforce. (4) Submit a support ticket to finalize the cutover, as some backend settings may need to be toggled. The new sync is optimized for latency but increases API usage on Salesforce; if the customer is sensitive to API consumption and needs to sync large amounts of data, consider delaying migration until bulk API actions and scheduled syncs are available in a future release. Support has a run book for this process, and the latest enablement PDF can be requested from the product team.","category":"procedural","topic":"Zuora 360 to Salesforce Connector upgrade"}
{"instruction":"What are the options and considerations for integrating Zuora with SAP ByDesign, and are there any known customer implementations or points to be aware of?","response":"There is an inquiry about cases where SAP ByDesign has been integrated with Zuora, but no detailed implementation information or best practices are provided in the available discussions. Customers interested in this integration should seek further guidance or case studies from the product or consulting teams, as the topic has been raised but not fully addressed in the shared resources.","category":"definitional","topic":"Zuora and SAP ByDesign integration"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer use multiple currencies and flexible billing/payment schedules in Zuora, and what are the limitations or best practices to consider?","response":"In Zuora, an account can only have one currency assigned, and this cannot be changed after setup. Multiple currencies can be used at the subscription level, but not at the account level. When enabling multi-currency, careful planning is required regarding catalog setup, account and subscription structure, billing and payment processes, and reporting (including FX rates and home vs transactional currency). Flexible billing/payment schedules are not currently compatible with the multiple currencies feature, so customers must decide which functionality is more critical for their use case. Best practice is to thoroughly assess business requirements before enabling multi-currency or flexible schedules.","category":"best_practice","topic":"multi-currency and billing schedules"}
{"instruction":"What is the current status and process for obtaining a trial tenant in Zuora, and who is responsible for handling these requests?","response":"The Center of Excellence (CoE) team does not handle trial tenant requests. If a trial tenant has not been created after application, follow up with the designated contact (e.g., Kevin, as referenced in past communications). If there is no response in the #trial_support_internal channel, escalate directly to the responsible individual or team. The process may require direct outreach rather than relying solely on internal support channels.","category":"procedural","topic":"Zuora trial tenant requests"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for integrating Zuora with external tax solutions for VAT tax return reporting, and what are the typical limitations?","response":"VAT tax return reports are typically generated out of the ERP or tax vendor system (such as Avalara or Vertex), as these solutions provide out-of-the-box tax return modules. While Zuora can provide the necessary data (e.g., invoice IDs, total invoice amounts, VAT paid), it does not generate tax return reports in the required format. Customers expecting Zuora to serve as the full AR subledger with tax return reporting should be aware of this limitation and plan to use their ERP or tax vendor for compliance reporting.","category":"definitional","topic":"VAT tax reporting integration"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling and using the Zuora to Informatica connector for moving data to Oracle ADW, and is there an official connector available?","response":"Zuora has not built an official Informatica connector. Customers seeking to move data from Zuora to Oracle ADW via Informatica will need to explore custom integration options or third-party solutions, as there is no out-of-the-box connector provided by Zuora.","category":"definitional","topic":"Zuora to Informatica/Oracle ADW integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the options and best practices for handling professional services billing in Zuora: usage/mediation vs one-time/OLI charges, and what are the revenue implications?","response":"The best approach for professional services (PS) billing in Zuora depends on the PS model. For time-and-materials (T&M), usage-based billing is preferred: set pricing per hour and feed in usage, which avoids amendments and aligns with consumption billing. Milestone billing may be better handled with one-time/OLI charges or invoice schedules. Usage-based billing is easier for loading usage, tracking burn-down, and reporting against caps. Mediation is only necessary for high-volume, complex T&M scenarios. Revenue implications differ: with usage, booking metrics may require custom fields to estimate project value, while invoice schedules book revenue upfront. Prepaid drawdown and minimum commit models also impact revenue recognition and subscription metrics. Customers should consider both operational and revenue impacts when choosing a billing model.","category":"best_practice","topic":"professional services billing models"}
{"instruction":"What is the process and timeline for enabling single-version subscriptions for customers with existing versioned subscriptions in Zuora, and can this be tested in a sandbox?","response":"Currently, a single-version subscription cannot be activated for customers who already have a versioned subscription live in the same tenant. General Availability (GA) for supporting this scenario is targeted for Q2-Q3 2026, but the quarter is not yet locked. Customers can test this functionality in a clean sandbox environment by submitting a support ticket to enable it. The sandbox must not have existing versioned subscriptions, or the feature can be enabled in a new, clean sandbox.","category":"procedural","topic":"single-version subscription enablement"}
{"instruction":"What are the key arguments and resources for positioning Zuora as a superior solution to Oracle ERP for quoting, billing, payments, and revenue management?","response":"Zuora is purpose-built for complex monetization models, offering a unified platform from quote to revenue, while Oracle ERPs are designed for hard goods and one-time transactions, making them less flexible for modern business models. Key arguments include: (1) ERPs are rigid and require extensive custom coding for changes; (2) Zuora enables dynamic pricing, multi-attribute bundles, and rapid go-to-market experimentation; (3) Zuora natively handles complex contract changes and revenue recognition, including bundling and SSP allocations; (4) Data silos and manual reconciliation are common in ERPs, but Zuora provides integrated, audit-proof processes. Recommended resources include the 'Candescent_QTR Considerations' deck and the 'UKG Workshop 25 June 2025' (Slide 222), which highlight these points and provide competitive positioning against Oracle.","category":"comparison","topic":"Zuora vs Oracle ERP"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for integrating Zuora with Salesforce Communities, and are there any live customer implementations?","response":"Zuora can be integrated with Salesforce Communities using available templates, including a blank/custom template suitable for integrating Zuora CPQ. While this integration has been proposed several times, there is uncertainty about whether any customers are currently live with a fully integrated solution. Customers interested in this integration should be prepared for a custom implementation and may need to consult with Zuora or Salesforce experts for guidance.","category":"procedural","topic":"Zuora and Salesforce Communities integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and considerations for using the Zuora API, and how does it compare to competitors like Stripe?","response":"Zuora's API is comprehensive, with over 500 endpoints, similar to Stripe. The key is to guide users to the right endpoints for their use case. Zuora provides resources such as a Dev Center with tutorials, FAQs, and videos (e.g., using Postman to perform common API tasks). The platform is working to address API confusion by offering decision trees and targeted enablement. While Stripe is often perceived as simpler, its API complexity is now comparable to Zuora's. Best practice is to leverage Zuora's enablement resources and upcoming Table Talks for managing the subscription lifecycle via API.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Zuora API usage and enablement"}
{"instruction":"What are the options and best practices for integrating Zuora with external eCommerce platforms, and what partner solutions are available?","response":"For customers seeking to enable subscriptions and eCommerce, several partner solutions are available. Limio has successful Zuora deployments, though experiences vary. Keylight was previously an option but has since developed its own billing platform. The Shopify connector is live with some customers, though it is still maturing. Subscription Factory has supported Philips with checkout and eCommerce capabilities. Experience Builder is Zuora's own offering, which is evolving. Customers should evaluate these options based on their specific use cases and consult with Zuora or partners for the latest capabilities and references.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Zuora eCommerce integrations"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for troubleshooting a mediation API call that returns a 500 error, and what permissions are required?","response":"When troubleshooting a mediation API call that returns a 500 error, first confirm that the necessary platform permissions (such as 'View' and 'Run Meters') are enabled. If permissions are correct and the error persists, further investigation is needed, potentially involving support. Ensure that the API call is correctly formatted and that the file being uploaded meets all requirements. If issues continue, escalate to Zuora support for deeper troubleshooting.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"mediation API troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for managing business processes through Revenue sync in Zuora, and what should customers consider during migration to real-time processing?","response":"Zuora is transitioning OTR (Order-to-Revenue) customers from legacy, file-based Revenue Sync to Real-Time Processing, which streamlines operations and provides near real-time visibility between Billing and Revenue. Customers must select a migration schedule and coordinate with Zuora for the transition. It is important to address any items stuck in Revenue sync before migration, as unresolved issues can impact renewals and customer satisfaction. Some customers with complex implementations will follow a separate process. Communication and coordination with engineering and support are critical to ensure a smooth migration.","category":"procedural","topic":"Revenue sync migration"}

Customers are encouraged to start using it and can obtain the SDK from the Zuora Dev Center. Any issues encountered should be reported via support tickets. The product owner for the SDK is Sheetal Prakash.","category":"procedural","topic":"Zuora C# SDK enablement"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling hardware and software ordering flows in Zuora, especially when fulfillment destinations differ?","response":"For customers selling hardware and software together, best practice is to use Order Line Items (OLIs) to bifurcate the ordering flow. For example, a physical device and warranty may be purchased together, but only the warranty is processed in Zuora. An upstream system (such as a POS) typically handles the bifurcation and feeds the appropriate data to Zuora. This approach has been successfully implemented for customers like Staples. Workflow naming conventions and quality are important for maintainability.","category":"best_practice","topic":"hardware/software order bifurcation"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for managing communication profiles via notifications and API in Zuora, and what recent changes should customers be aware of?","response":"Customers using API users to access notifications and events in Zuora must ensure those users have the appropriate platform admin role, as recent updates have restricted certain API calls to this role for compliance and security. The change was deployed in August 2025, and customers cannot assign the new permissions prior to the update. It is important to review user roles and permissions to avoid disruptions. Notifications triggered from other notifications are not impacted. Customers should monitor release notes and community posts for updates.","category":"best_practice","topic":"notifications and permissions management"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for managing multi-entity and multi-currency setups in Zuora, and what should customers consider before enabling these features?","response":"Multi-entity and multi-currency setups in Zuora require careful planning. Only one currency can be assigned per billing account, and this cannot be changed after setup. Multiple currencies can be used at the subscription level, but not at the account level. Enabling multi-currency impacts catalog design, account and subscription structure, billing/payment processes, and reporting (including FX rates and home vs transactional currency). Customers should thoroughly assess their business requirements and consult with Zuora experts before enabling these features to avoid complications with billing, payment schedules, and reporting.","category":"best_practice","topic":"multi-entity and multi-currency management"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for registering for Z Collections certification, and what are the access restrictions?","response":"Z Collections certification is restricted to Highspot users, but the training content is available in Google Drive.

{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling contract modifications and upsells in environments with Salesforce CPQ and NetSuite ARM, and what are the limitations of NetSuite ARM?","response":"For customers using Salesforce CPQ and NetSuite ARM, contract modifications (such as upsells) are typically handled by creating a new subscription for the upsell period and aligning it with the prior bill cycle day. NetSuite SuiteBilling supports this use case with renewal change orders, and NS ARM automatically creates new revenue arrangements. Without SuiteBilling, modifications can be synced from Zuora Billing to NetSuite as sales orders or invoices. However, NS ARM does not automatically merge new and existing revenue arrangements for fair value allocations; this must be done manually or via custom scripts. This limitation often drives customers to seek alternative solutions. Customers should consult with experts familiar with both platforms to ensure proper handling of contract modifications and revenue recognition.","category":"best_practice","topic":"contract modifications with Salesforce CPQ and NetSuite ARM"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for using the Zuora Recommendation Repository and gathering customer north star examples during workshops?","response":"When gathering customer north star examples during workshops, it is helpful to reference the Recommendation Repository, which contains documented examples from past workshops. These examples can inform recommendations and planning for new customers.

{"instruction":"How can a customer add a new product to an existing subscription using Data Loader, and what are the current limitations or options if they do not want to use Orders API or Dev Tools?","response":"To add a new product to an existing subscription, customers can use Data Loader. The process is supported, and customers do not need Dev Tools for this action. They should use the appropriate Data Loader template for Orders, which supports adding products to existing subscriptions. If the customer wants to perform multiple actions or use charge overrides, there is a specific template for this that can be enabled upon request through Zendesk. While amendments are also supported in Data Loader, the amendment data dictionary (DD) is currently missing, but a rough version can be provided. If the customer is still on the older Order Harmonization (OH) model and does not want to use the Orders API (since Orders are not visible in the UI), they can still proceed with Data Loader using the available templates, but should be aware that the template format differs from the legacy Mass Order Entry. For more advanced scenarios, the Orders - Chargeoverrides template in Data Loader is in Early Access and can be enabled for testing tenants upon request.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Loader amendments and product add to subscription"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between the % spend (percentage of spend) and flexible commitment revenue models, and what are their typical use cases?","response":"The % spend (also known as % Charge Model) is a pricing model where the charge amount is calculated as a percentage of another billed amount, typically tied to a customer's usage or overall spend. For example, if a customer is billed $100K/month for usage, a 10% support fee would automatically add $10K. This model is commonly used for support fees or similar add-ons. The flexible commitment (Commitment Spend Model) is a contractual model where the customer commits to spend a minimum amount over a period (monthly, annual, etc.), and actual usage or charges are tracked against this commitment. If the customer does not meet the committed spend (e.g., commits to $2M/year but only uses $1.85M), a true-up is invoiced at year-end to ensure the minimum spend is met. This model is often used for enterprise contracts with minimum commitments and true-up mechanisms.","category":"definitional","topic":"% spend vs flexible commitment revenue models"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer monitor their own utilization and volume metrics in Zuora, and what tools or dashboards are available to them?","response":"Customers can monitor their own utilization and volume metrics using the Command Center available in OneID. Admins can access a dashboard in OneID under management tools, which displays volume and subscriber counts. This dashboard is called Command Center, and more details can be found in Zuora University.

{"instruction":"What are best practices for B2C companies in Canada sending invoices in both English and French?","response":"Best practice is to capture the desired language from the customer upfront and assign localized communication profiles and invoice templates accordingly. This allows the system to send invoices in the customer's preferred language. While some customers consider creating a single template with both languages, it is more efficient to use custom logic to select the appropriate template based on the customer's language preference. This approach saves effort and reduces complexity downstream. The ability to implement custom logic may depend on whether it is available in the production environment.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Bilingual invoicing for Canadian B2C companies"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer display unbilled usage data on a customer portal, and what data sources or APIs are available for this purpose?","response":"Unbilled usage data can be displayed on a customer portal by querying the Rating Result table, which is accessible via API and Data Source Export. This table includes both billed and unbilled usage, and the 'status' field can be used to differentiate between them (e.g., 'rated' vs 'billed'). Notifications and workflows can also be built off this data to push information to the portal. The Rating Result data source supports the display of this information in the UI as well.","category":"procedural","topic":"Displaying unbilled usage data on customer portal"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for handling remaining invoice items in an invoice schedule if a subscription is cancelled before the end of the schedule?","response":"If a subscription is cancelled before the end of its invoice schedule, the system does not automatically cancel the invoice schedule. Options include pausing the invoice schedule indefinitely or deleting it. There is no automatic linkage between subscription cancellation and invoice schedule termination, so manual intervention is required to manage the remaining invoice items.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoice schedule management after subscription cancellation"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and available resources for integrating Zuora with e-commerce platforms such as Adobe Commerce, Shopify, and Salesforce Commerce?","response":"Best practices for integrating Zuora with e-commerce platforms include leveraging solution guides and resources from the TC group, which has experience with both standard and custom integrations. Commerce Tools is often recommended as a preferred platform for integration. There are also tutorials available on the Zuora developer site that, while not specific to any one e-commerce solution, cover the general use cases required for e-commerce flows. For customer references and more detailed best practices, it is suggested to contact the TC group or individuals with experience in custom integrations. Additionally, there are resources showcasing best practices for homegrown e-commerce tools.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Zuora integration with e-commerce platforms"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer associate a single payment schedule with multiple invoices in Zuora?","response":"Associating a single payment schedule with multiple invoices is supported via API but not through the UI. According to the Zuora Knowledge Center, this functionality is available, but customers must use the API to link a payment schedule to more than one billing document.","category":"procedural","topic":"Payment schedule association with multiple invoices"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for updating Zuora managed packages in Salesforce for Quotes and 360, and what precautions should be taken?","response":"To update Zuora managed packages in Salesforce for Quotes and 360, customers should obtain the latest installation links from Zuora Support or relevant internal channels. The installation process involves appending the environment URL with the installation URL, which initiates the update. It is recommended to perform the upgrade in a sandbox environment first to ensure that customizations are not adversely affected. If the customer is already on version 10.x for Quotes, the upgrade should be straightforward unless they are moving from CPQ9 screens to Quote Studio, which is a more significant change. Support typically provides the necessary links as part of the support ticket process.","category":"procedural","topic":"Updating Zuora managed packages in Salesforce"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to handle payments made outside of Zuora and record the payment method used in Zuora?","response":"When payments are processed outside of Zuora (e.g., in SAP), and there is a need to record the payment method in Zuora, a custom field can be used to capture identifying information such as the last four digits or a payment ID from the external system. Alternatively, an existing field like 'second_reference_id' can be repurposed, but using a dedicated custom field is generally cleaner. Some customers, like Twilio, use the payment ID/number from the external system. The 'number' field in the create payment API can be used to send a custom payment number, and this feature can be enabled in Payment Settings > Payment Rules. The 'source' field in the Query Payments API can help filter payments created via API.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Recording external payment method in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer see how many records they have in their Zuora sandbox environment?","response":"Customers can check the number of records in their sandbox by referring to a Google Sheet that contains this information. This sheet is maintained internally and can be shared with those who need to verify if they are approaching or exceeding sandbox limits.","category":"procedural","topic":"Checking record count in Zuora sandbox"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling Custom Logic or Payment Gateway Routing in a lower environment, and is any authorization required?","response":"Custom Logic is available in all customer sandboxes, but occasionally it may be missing in newly provisioned tenants. In such cases, working with the appropriate internal team (e.g., Zeenie Louis and team) is recommended to get it enabled. Payment Gateway Routing can be activated by the customer and does not require a feature toggle or special authorization.","category":"procedural","topic":"Enabling Custom Logic and Payment Gateway Routing in lower environments"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer mask credit card numbers as they are entered in the Zuora Iframe, and are there any out-of-the-box options?","response":"There is no out-of-the-box option to mask credit card numbers as they are entered in the Zuora Iframe (e.g., with dots or asterisks). This request has been logged as an AOC (Ask Our Community), and others have encountered similar requirements. The current workaround is to log a request and check for any custom solutions, but no standard feature exists for this masking at the point of entry.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Masking credit card numbers in Zuora Iframe"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for scheduling Bill Runs (BR) and Payment Runs (PR) as a customer grows and bill run times increase?","response":"As customers grow and bill run times increase, it is best practice to either batch customers as much as possible or use Workflow as an alternative to trigger the Payment Run once the Bill Run is complete. This helps avoid missing Payment Runs due to extended Bill Run durations.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Scheduling Bill Runs and Payment Runs as customer grows"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer update the PO number on a subscription each year for multi-year contracts with annual billing, and what is the recommended architecture?","response":"To dynamically update the PO number on a subscription each year, the recommended approach is to have Zuora notify the client as the annual billing anniversary approaches, prompting them to update their PO number in the e-Store (hosted in Salesforce or another system). The e-Store should then push the updated PO number to the Zuora subscription. This does not require an Order Action; the subscription object can be updated directly via API. The process should be managed by the e-Store team, and there are no native Zuora capabilities to automate this without some development work on the e-Store side.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Updating PO number on subscription for annual billing"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling the Business Automation Dashboard in Zuora, and is it still supported?","response":"The Business Automation Dashboard can still be enabled in Zuora. Although the Knowledge Center article supporting it has been taken down, the functionality remains available. Product has confirmed that only the documentation was removed, not the feature itself. For assistance, the #homepage-rollout-questions channel is recommended for finding support.","category":"procedural","topic":"Enabling Business Automation Dashboard in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer handle a scenario where a parent account is invoiced for pre-payment and a child account is responsible for overages, particularly with PPDD (prepaid drawdown) models?","response":"One approach is to set the parent as the invoice owner and the child as the subscription owner. Overages can be handled by creating a standalone invoice for the child and writing off the parent invoice, or by using the invoice owner transfer feature, though this can become complex with frequent transfers. Another method is to put an overage charge on a subscription under the child account that mirrors the terms of the parent's subscription. Mediation workflows can be used to route usage as a quantity against a ratable overage charge once the PPDD total is met or exceeded, with the overage charge living under the child's subscription. If a single usage event needs to be split (e.g., part of it is covered by the prepaid and part is overage), the event must be split into two records, one for each account. The complexity increases if the validity period and usage billing period differ (e.g., annual validity, monthly billing).","category":"best_practice","topic":"Parent-child account overage handling with PPDD"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling Orders Harmonization (Orders Harm) in production, and does it require a support ticket?","response":"Customers can now enable Orders Harmonization in production themselves from the Feature Management settings. A support ticket is no longer required for this action.","category":"procedural","topic":"Enabling Orders Harmonization in production"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for setting up scheduled bill runs, payment runs, and workflows in Zuora, especially regarding user accounts?","response":"It is best practice to use a non-human user account for scheduled bill runs, payment runs, and workflows. If a user who created a recurring bill run is deactivated, the schedule may start failing and need to be recreated. Using a dedicated system user helps with tracking and avoids disruptions if personnel changes occur.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Best practice for scheduled runs and user accounts in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer integrate Zuora with a contract management (CLM) system to store contract PDFs, and what is the recommended process for migrating existing attachments?","response":"For integrating Zuora with a contract management (CLM) system, the preferred approach is for the web application to store the contract PDF directly in the new CLM platform and create the subscription in Zuora. Existing PDFs attached to subscriptions in Zuora will need to be migrated to the CLM. The actual paper contract typically resides outside Zuora, and attachments in Zuora are not ideal for large volumes. The migration process involves extracting the PDFs from Zuora and importing them into the CLM platform.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integrating Zuora with contract management systems"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling and using the Zuora Command Center, and what can it be used for?","response":"The Zuora Command Center is available as a course and can be used to monitor system health, track tenant status, and view key metrics such as product entitlements, trust status, and support trends. It is accessible to OneID admins and provides a dashboard for monitoring utilization and other metrics. The data is refreshed every 24 hours. The Command Center is referenced in both enablement sessions and the Knowledge Center.","category":"procedural","topic":"Zuora Command Center usage and enablement"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer use Power BI with Zuora data, and what are the recommended integration methods?","response":"Power BI is a visualization tool that typically connects to a database or data warehouse. The recommended approach is for the customer to have a data warehouse ingesting Zuora data, with Power BI connected to it. Supported databases include SQL Server, MySQL, and Postgres. For small teams, local files or CSVs exported from Zuora can be used. Zuora offers pre-built connectors for various data warehouses (BYOW - Bring Your Own Warehouse), which can automatically push data to the warehouse for Power BI to consume. If the customer does not have a data warehouse, they can use Zoql exports or Data Source Exports loaded into their own database via middleware.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Power BI integration with Zuora data"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling Custom Logic in production for a customer, and who should be contacted?","response":"If Custom Logic is still in Early Access (EA), requests to enable it in production should be directed to the relevant product managers, such as Errol, Taylor M., or Kiuran. They can assist with enabling the feature for the customer.","category":"procedural","topic":"Enabling Custom Logic in production"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer mask credit card numbers while collecting payment details using Zuora's Iframe, and what are the current solutions or workarounds?","response":"There is no standard out-of-the-box solution to mask credit card numbers as they are entered in Zuora's Iframe. This requirement has been logged as an AOC, and others have encountered similar requests. The current approach is to log the request and check for any custom solutions, but no standard feature exists for masking at the point of entry.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Masking credit card numbers in Zuora Iframe"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer monitor their own TAR (Transaction Activity Reporting) usage in Snowflake, and what tables are available for this purpose?","response":"Customers can monitor their own TAR usage in Snowflake by querying the TAR_USAGE_HISTORY and DATA_QUALITY_LOG tables, which are generated by Zuora for data monitoring purposes. These tables provide insights into usage and data quality for customers using Zuora Secure Data Share for Snowflake.","category":"procedural","topic":"Monitoring TAR usage in Snowflake"}

{"instruction":"How can a customer handle taxable and nontaxable drawdown products under one prepaid in Zuora?","response":"It is possible to have both taxable and nontaxable drawdown products under one prepaid. The tax treatment depends on how the charges are set up in the product catalog. For example, in a test scenario, both the prepaid and the usage overage were taxed when set as taxable. The setup in the product catalog determines whether each component is taxed.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Taxable and nontaxable drawdown products under one prepaid"}

{"instruction":"How can a customer get a list of all potential IP addresses that could be used to send emails from their Zuora production tenant, and is there a better way to set up SMTP relays than using IP addresses?","response":"Customers can find a list of all possible IP addresses that could be used to send emails from their Zuora production tenant in the Zuora Knowledge Center, specifically on the page about inbound and outbound IP addresses. However, Zuora strongly discourages implementing outbound whitelisting based on IP address restrictions because the service environments are deployed on public cloud infrastructure, and IP addresses are subject to change without advance notice. Instead, DNS-based whitelisting is recommended, as the registered service name will remain consistent even if the underlying IPs change. This approach is more reliable for enabling SMTP relays, as it avoids issues caused by dynamic IP allocation in the cloud environment.","category":"best_practice","topic":"SMTP relay and Zuora outbound email IP addresses"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between invoice settlement and invoice item settlement in Zuora, and are they always enabled together? Is invoice item settlement compatible with Zuora Revenue?","response":"Invoice settlement allows payments or credit memos to be applied at the invoice (header) level, while invoice item settlement enables applying payments or credits to specific lines on the invoice. Invoice item settlement is not always enabled when invoice settlement is enabled; it has commercial implications and may require additional enablement in some catalogs. There is no impact to Zuora Revenue from enabling invoice item settlement, and it was a prerequisite for enabling certain features like PPD with Cash.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice settlement vs. invoice item settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer correct service dates on subscriptions in Zuora so that only the difference is debited or credited, rather than crediting the full amount and debiting the new total? Can this be automated or done in mass?","response":"To correct service dates and only debit or credit the difference (rather than crediting the full amount and debiting the new total), customers can use the Debit Memo functionality associated with the invoice. For large subsets of customers, this can be automated via a workflow built for this use case, provided all associated accounts, invoices, and amounts to be debited are available in a CSV file. Alternatively, after making the amendment and running a bill run, the system will generate a credit and a new invoice, and the credit can be applied to the invoice, resulting in a net balance. There is also a tenant-level setting that can configure the bill run to generate just the difference as an invoice.","category":"procedural","topic":"Correcting service dates and partial debits/credits"}
{"instruction":"What are the options and best practices for writing off bad debt in Zuora Billing, and how can customers ensure the write-off hits an expense account instead of backing out revenue?","response":"The common approach for writing off bad debt in Zuora Billing is to use a credit memo (CM) to write off the balance. Billing does not have a mechanism for creating manual entries, so the CM is used for this purpose. In the write-off process, users can enable or disable the 'Revenue Impacting' option. If disabled, users can select an expense accounting code (such as bad-debt expense) so the write-off hits an expense account rather than backing out revenue. This can be automated using Workflow, which can query for invoices past due and call the API to write off the invoice, overriding the CMI account to use a bad debt account. This ensures the write-off is treated as an expense. For more complex scenarios, such as splitting between bad debt and concession, customers may need to adjust the workflow to allocate amounts appropriately without affecting recognized revenue to date.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Bad debt write-off in Zuora Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer bulk distribute revenue from all accounts with undistributed revenue due to missing accounting periods in Zuora Billing?","response":"In Zuora Billing, customers can use the mass updater tool to bulk distribute revenue from all accounts with undistributed revenue caused by missing accounting periods. By filling out the provided template and uploading it to the mass updater, they can perform this as a bulk operation. The template allows updating revenue schedules in mass, streamlining the process for multiple accounts at once.","category":"procedural","topic":"Bulk revenue distribution for missing accounting periods"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to separate workflows (WF) based on orgs in a Multi-org environment in Zuora?","response":"A customer asked if it's possible to separate workflows based on orgs in a Multi-org environment, but there is no direct answer or solution provided in the discussion. The question was raised to product experts, but no procedural steps or confirmation of support for this feature is present.","category":"definitional","topic":"Workflow separation in Multi-org environment"}
{"instruction":"What is the proper way to restore a previously cancelled subscription in Zuora, especially for B2C scenarios like Peloton?","response":"The cleanest way to restore a previously cancelled subscription is to create a new subscription. This approach avoids complications arising from different scenarios, such as the time elapsed since cancellation or whether a credit memo was created or refunded. There are often too many conditional cases to reliably 'undo' a cancellation, so starting a new subscription is generally best practice.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Restoring cancelled subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and implications of suspending versus cancelling subscriptions in Zuora, and how do customers track the reason for suspension?","response":"Some customers, like iRobot, use suspension instead of cancellation to preserve user history in case the customer returns. If a customer comes back, the subscription can be resumed. Suspension can also be used for nonpayment, with a custom field to track the reason for suspension. This approach allows for better customer retention and operational flexibility, but may have implications for reporting and requires tracking the suspension reason.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Suspending vs. cancelling subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer see if their API concurrency limits have been increased by support, and where is this information displayed?","response":"Customers can check if their API concurrency limits have been increased by support by viewing the API Concurrency dashboard in Grafana. This dashboard provides real-time visibility into concurrency limits and usage. The dashboard was also discussed in a Performance Tech Talk session.","category":"procedural","topic":"API concurrency limits dashboard"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer validate which revenue product (Advanced Revenue or Central Revenue) they have, and what is the definitive source of truth?","response":"To validate which revenue product a customer has (Advanced Revenue or Central Revenue), the most definitive source is the order form, which can be pulled by the Account Executive (AE) or found in Salesforce on the opportunity's files. Cerebro may display the product, but the order form is the authoritative document. Support may provide information, but the order form should be used for confirmation.","category":"procedural","topic":"Validating revenue product entitlement"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer see how many workflow definitions they are using, and where is this information found?","response":"Customers can see how many workflow definitions they are using by checking the 'utilized' section in Cerebro, specifically in the trends area rather than the utilization tab. This section provides information on the number of active workflow definitions in use.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow definition utilization"}
{"instruction":"Can the Prepaid Drawdown feature in Zuora Billing be used with multiple units of measure (UOMs) drawing down from the same prepaid product, and can unused amounts roll over from month to month if paid for a full year?","response":"Yes, multiple drawdown charges can be configured against the same prepaid charge, and using currency drawdown is often simpler. For example, a bucket of hours can be drawn down at different rates depending on the service. Additionally, it is possible to roll over unused amounts from month to month if a customer paid for a full year, as the validity period for the prepaid charge can be defined to allow this behavior.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepaid Drawdown with multiple UOMs and rollover"}
{"instruction":"What APIs are available for customers to pull the status of Drawdown (e.g., how much has been used), and what is the difference between the available APIs?","response":"Customers can use the GET PrepaidBalanceFundByKey API to get the current state of the pool of funds for Drawdown. The GET SubscriptionsByKey API provides information about the starting conditions but not the current balance. To see transactions impacting the fund, the queryPrepaidBalanceTransactions API can be used. Data Query also supports getting balances. The main difference is that PrepaidBalanceFundByKey gives the current balance, SubscriptionsByKey gives initial conditions, and PrepaidBalanceTransactions provides transaction history.","category":"definitional","topic":"APIs for Drawdown status and balances"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling API user credential refreshes in Zuora, both for sandbox and production environments?","response":"Best practice is to follow the corporate standard for credential refreshes. For example, Zuora's Okta resets quarterly. API user credentials, however, should rarely be updated unless there is a specific reason, such as a security incident. Additionally, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for UI users is recommended.","category":"best_practice","topic":"API user credential refresh best practices"}

{"instruction":"What are the options for integrating Adobe Commerce with Zuora without a pre-built connector, and are there any customer examples or high-level designs available?","response":"Integration between Adobe Commerce and Zuora can be achieved using APIs. There is a lightweight playbook and demo available, which serve as a blueprint rather than a pre-built connection. Some customers have implemented this approach, and there are decks available that outline high-level designs. For more details, internal resources or product experts may have additional customer examples.","category":"definitional","topic":"Adobe Commerce integration with Zuora via APIs"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for using the same Salesforce API user and connected app for both 360 sync and Zuora Workflow that calls the Salesforce API?","response":"While it is technically possible to use the same Salesforce API user and connected app for both 360 sync and Workflow, it is not recommended. Sharing credentials between different processes blends audit trails, making it harder to identify which service is making changes and complicating debugging. Additionally, permissions may need to be extended, which may not be desirable. The best practice is to use a separate API credential set with narrow permissions for each integration. There is no official documentation for this scenario, as it is considered a customer-specific customization.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Salesforce API user and connected app sharing for 360 sync and Workflow"}
{"instruction":"What is the process and level of effort (LOE) for moving test data from an API sandbox to a Central Sandbox (CSBX) in Zuora, and what are the considerations?","response":"There is no easy way to export all versions of all (or even a subset of) subscriptions and import them so they have the same version in another sandbox. Moving data to CSBX won't help after the next refresh either, as the data would need to be reloaded each time. The best test data is production copy data, which is what CSBX provides. Customers should consider whether preserving test data is worth the effort, as it can be complex and not sustainable long-term.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Moving test data from API sandbox to CSBX"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for generating invoices in Zuora that exclude $0 items, and how can operational efficiency be improved when there are many $0 invoice items?","response":"Customers can hide $0 items on the PDF invoice or filter usage charges out on Bill Run if they only want to bill recurring items. However, this does not reduce the number of $0 items in the system, which can impact processing time for Trial Balance, Journal Run, and reporting. To improve operational efficiency, customers may need to review their billing strategy, batch processing, and journal entry handling. There is no direct solution to exclude $0 items from the system entirely, but operational improvements can be made by optimizing batch runs and export processes.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Excluding $0 items from invoices and improving efficiency"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling notification of job completion when using Dev Tools for bulk operations in Zuora?","response":"Dev Tools do not send notifications to the user email when a job finishes. There is no out-of-the-box solution for this, but users can self-monitor job status using dashboards like Command Center or System Health once OneID is enabled. Creative solutions may involve building custom notifications or monitoring tools outside of Zuora.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Job completion notifications for Dev Tools bulk operations"}
{"instruction":"What are the key reasons Central Sandbox (CSBX) is more expensive than Revenue Sandbox (RSBX) in Zuora?","response":"CSBX is typically more expensive than RSBX because it handles more data (number of objects in Zuora Billing vs. Zuora Revenue) and is a much bigger platform. CSBX is also optimized for higher performance and load testing, whereas RSBX is not designed for such use cases.","category":"definitional","topic":"CSBX vs. RSBX cost differences"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer bulk update the OrderLine Item State field in Zuora, and what are the available options for end-user-friendly mass updates?","response":"There is no easy way to bulk update the OrderLine Item State field outside of using the API. Dev Tools do not support this field for mass updates. The recommended approach is to use Workflow, potentially triggered by a UI button, to perform the updates in a more end-user-friendly way.","category":"procedural","topic":"Bulk updating OrderLine Item State"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for restoring a previously cancelled subscription in Zuora, and what are the implications of suspending versus cancelling subscriptions?","response":"The best practice for restoring a previously cancelled subscription is to create a new subscription, as this approach handles most scenarios cleanly and avoids complications with amendments or credit memos.

{"instruction":"How can a customer configure pre-auth amounts for card validation in Zuora, specifically for the Adyen gateway, and what should they check if the pre-auth amount is not working as expected?","response":"Pre-auth amounts can be configured in the payment gateway setup. For Adyen, the documentation states that pre-auth should be supported. If the customer is still seeing full amount pre-auths, they should check if they are on the 2.0 integration and consult with a CSA or support to determine if there is a bug or misconfiguration.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Configuring pre-auth amounts for Adyen gateway"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling slowness in the Zuora UI, and what steps should be taken to diagnose the issue?","response":"If a customer is experiencing slowness in the Zuora UI, the first step is to determine which environment is affected (e.g., production). System health dashboards in the tenant can provide insights, but if access is not available, customers should be asked for a video and network logs from the browser's inspect console. This information can help diagnose whether the issue is with the UI, APIs, or both.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Diagnosing Zuora UI slowness"}
{"instruction":"What are the requirements and steps for enabling multi-attribute pricing (MAP) on usage charges in Zuora, and what should be checked if the option is missing?","response":"To enable multi-attribute pricing (MAP) on usage charges, the charge model must be enabled in Billing Settings. If the option is missing, check that the Advanced Billing Package is enabled, as MAP is a paid feature and feature-controlled. Even on Enterprise, the feature may need to be explicitly enabled by support after verifying the license. A support ticket may be required to enable the necessary permissions.","category":"procedural","topic":"Enabling multi-attribute pricing on usage charges"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for customers who want to send detailed journal entries (JEs) to their ERP system from Zuora, and are there connectors available for different ERPs?","response":"Some customers require detailed journal entries to be delivered to their ERP system for regulatory or operational reasons. This can be achieved through custom workflows or integrations, such as using Data Query in Workflow to merge data into CSV files. There are connectors available for SAP, Workday, and NetSuite, with detailed JEs planned for the SAP Connector. For other ERPs like Microsoft Dynamics 365, custom integrations may be needed, though there is a Zuora Revenue Connector for Dynamics.

{"instruction":"What are the options for reactivating a subscription or updating the cancellation date in Zuora Orders if a cancellation was processed incorrectly, especially for revenue customers?","response":"There is no easy answer for reactivating a subscription or updating the cancellation date if a cancellation was processed incorrectly. For non-revenue customers, the order can be deleted. For revenue customers, the current process is to delete the order in Billing and file a support ticket to delete the corresponding record in Revenue. This can cause versioning issues, but the data fix in Revenue should handle it. A new feature is coming for single version subscriptions to revert an order, which will simplify this process in the future. In the meantime, customers should investigate why incorrect cancellations are occurring and consider using scheduled or pending orders to prevent mistakes.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Reactivating subscriptions and correcting cancellations in Orders"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for customers who want to export all data out of Zuora, and is there a bulk approach available?","response":"Currently, data exports in Zuora are performed one object at a time. There is no built-in bulk export option for all data across objects. Customers seeking a bulk approach may need to use custom scripts or tools to automate the export process for each object individually.","category":"definitional","topic":"Bulk data export options in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for integrating Salesforce B2B Commerce with Zuora, and are there any customer-facing or internal resources available?","response":"There is an old integration document for Salesforce B2B Commerce (formerly CloudCraze) that depicts integration with Zuora, based on a successful implementation at Symantec. The document is customer-facing but may contain outdated information (e.g., Subscribe/Amend model) and should be updated for current best practices. Internal experts who worked on the integration may be available for consultation, and GS has built custom integrations for various customers.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Salesforce B2B Commerce integration with Zuora"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for customers who want to incentivize adding ACH as a payment method via payment links in Zuora, and what are the limitations?","response":"Payment Links in Zuora support Credit Card, ACH, and SEPA, and storing the payment method on file is the default behavior (with an option to make storage optional in the future). However, payment links will display all available payment methods in the tenant, not just ACH. Additionally, customers should verify that their payment gateway supports ACH payments via payment links. There is a separate feature for one-time links (not storing the payment method) planned for the future.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Incentivizing ACH adoption via payment links"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for customers who want to use Zuora Fraud Protection (ZFP) for transactions outside of Zuora, and can ZFP be sold as a standalone product?","response":"ZFP is only integrated through the Zuora Hosted Payment Method (HPM) page and cannot be used to screen transactions outside of Zuora. It cannot be sold as a standalone product; it is only available for payments processed through Zuora.","category":"definitional","topic":"Zuora Fraud Protection (ZFP) usage limitations"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for using promo codes in Zuora to mimic gift card behavior, and what alternatives are recommended?","response":"Promo codes in Zuora primarily support code management, but managing downstream effects (like balances) requires additional solutions. Workflow or Custom Objects are better suited for mimicking gift card behavior, as they allow for more flexible management of balances and restrictions. Prepaid Cash can also be used to manage balances and apply them to new subscriptions. Considerations include whether the gift card can be used for any product, managing open gift cards, and handling financial aspects like cash on account or liability accounts.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Alternatives to promo codes for gift card behavior"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for customers who want to update the API version for the Zuora to Salesforce integration, and who can assist with this process?","response":"Updating the API version for the Zuora to Salesforce integration may require assistance from product experts or support. In one case, a team member named Kishore was identified as a resource to help with this process. Customers should reach out to their support contacts or internal experts for guidance.","category":"procedural","topic":"Updating API version for Zuora-Salesforce integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for customers who want to use the same Salesforce API user and connected app for both 360 sync and Workflow, and what are the implications?","response":"While it is possible to use the same Salesforce API user and connected app for both 360 sync and Workflow, it is not recommended due to audit and permission management concerns. Sharing credentials makes it harder to track changes and may require extending permissions beyond what is desired. The best practice is to use separate API credentials with narrow permissions for each integration. There is no official documentation for this scenario, as it is considered a customer-specific customization.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Salesforce API user and connected app sharing for 360 sync and Workflow"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for customers who want to see a dashboard of their concurrency limits and usage in Zuora?","response":"Customers can view their API concurrency limits and usage in the API Concurrency dashboard available in Grafana. This dashboard provides real-time visibility into concurrency limits and was discussed in a Performance Tech Talk session.","category":"procedural","topic":"API concurrency limits dashboard"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for customers who want to validate which revenue product (Advanced Revenue or Central Revenue) they have, and what is the definitive source of truth?","response":"The most definitive source for validating which revenue product a customer has is the order form, which can be pulled by the Account Executive or found in Salesforce on the opportunity's files. Cerebro may display the product, but the order form is the authoritative document. Support may provide information, but the order form should be used for confirmation.","category":"procedural","topic":"Validating revenue product entitlement"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for customers who want to see how many workflow definitions they are using, and where is this information found?","response":"Customers can see how many workflow definitions they are using by checking the 'utilized' section in Cerebro, specifically in the trends area rather than the utilization tab. This section provides information on the number of active workflow definitions in use.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow definition utilization"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for customers who want to use the Prepaid Drawdown feature in Zuora Billing with multiple units of measure (UOMs) and allow unused amounts to roll over from month to month?","response":"Multiple drawdown charges can be configured against the same prepaid charge, and using currency drawdown is often simpler. For example, a bucket of hours can be drawn down at different rates depending on the service. It is also possible to roll over unused amounts from month to month if a customer paid for a full year, as the validity period for the prepaid charge can be defined to allow this behavior.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepaid Drawdown with multiple UOMs and rollover"}
{"instruction":"What APIs are available for customers to pull the status of Drawdown in Zuora, and what is the difference between the available APIs?","response":"Customers can use the GET PrepaidBalanceFundByKey API to get the current state of the pool of funds for Drawdown. The GET SubscriptionsByKey API provides information about the starting conditions but not the current balance. To see transactions impacting the fund, the queryPrepaidBalanceTransactions API can be used. Data Query also supports getting balances. The main difference is that PrepaidBalanceFundByKey gives the current balance, SubscriptionsByKey gives initial conditions, and PrepaidBalanceTransactions provides transaction history.","category":"definitional","topic":"APIs for Drawdown status and balances"}
{"instruction":"Explain how to resolve inconsistent invoice amounts when using Delivery-Based Pricing in Zuora, especially when the number of delivery days appears the same but invoice totals fluctuate. Include best practices for configuring the billing period and any available resources for further learning.","response":"To achieve consistent invoice amounts with Delivery-Based Pricing in Zuora, ensure that the charge's billing period matches the delivery schedule. For example, if deliveries occur Monday to Saturday (6 days per week), set the billing period to 'week' rather than 'month.' This alignment ensures that each invoice covers a consistent number of delivery days, preventing fluctuations in invoice totals even when the number of working days appears the same across periods. If the billing period is set to 'month' while the delivery schedule is weekly, the number of delivery days per invoice can vary due to how weeks overlap with months, leading to inconsistent amounts. For more details and a demo video, refer to Zuora's knowledge center on Delivery Pricing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Delivery-Based Pricing in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"What is the most efficient way to implement mid-term subscription-level price increases across a large customer base in Zuora, and what are the limitations of current tools?","response":"The Data Loader tool can be used to implement mid-term subscription-level price increases, but it requires preparing and uploading a large CSV file. The Batch Price Update widget on the homepage allows for updating prices based on criteria such as 'charge name' and 'billing batch,' and generates a series of Orders. However, this tool currently only updates one rate plan charge at a time, making it inefficient for bulk updates across hundreds of charges. There is interest in a more streamlined approach that would allow selecting subscriptions rather than individual charges, but this is not yet available. For now, large-scale price updates require either manual processing or CSV uploads, and product feedback has been provided to improve automation for this use case.","category":"procedural","topic":"Bulk Subscription Price Increases"}
{"instruction":"Describe the process and best practices for applying promo codes in Zuora, including API steps and UI limitations. Can the process be streamlined or automated?","response":"Applying promo codes in Zuora involves three main API steps: (1) Validate the promo code using the /api/v1/tools/promos/{code}/validate endpoint; (2) Burn (consume) the code with /api/v1/tools/promos/{code}/consume; and (3) Create the subscription or order, adding the discount rate plan charge as appropriate. There is currently no way to apply a promo code directly via the UI; the process must be handled through API calls. The first two steps interact with the Promo Codes application, which is separate from Zuora Billing. To streamline the process, a workflow can be created that automates validation, burning, and then submitting the order payload. Future product enhancements may further simplify this process, potentially reducing it to a single step, but as of now, three API calls are required and UI support is not available.","category":"procedural","topic":"Promo Code Application in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can you configure some charges in the Zuora product catalog to be prorated and others to be non-proratable? Is there a feature that needs to be enabled?","response":"Proration can be set at the charge level in Zuora. To configure some charges as proratable and others as non-proratable, enable the 'Charge Level Proration' feature in Billing Settings under Manage Features. Once enabled, you can specify proration settings individually for each charge in the product catalog.","category":"procedural","topic":"Charge-Level Proration Settings"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and considerations for integrating Zuora Billing and Revenue with PeopleSoft Finance (Billing & GL, AR & GL)? Is there a prebuilt connector, and what is the recommended integration approach?","response":"There is no prebuilt connector for integrating Zuora Billing or Revenue with PeopleSoft Finance. The recommended approach is to use a summary-level Journal Entry (JE) interface, exporting summary JEs from both Billing and Revenue and importing them into PeopleSoft. For Billing, the Configurable Summary GL Connector can be used to generate summary JEs in batch. For Revenue, ETL/ESB/WebService methods are recommended to sync JEs. If detailed, transactional-level integration is required, a custom flow must be designed to extract all relevant transaction data (invoices, payments, memos, etc.) with attention to FX rates and timing. However, detailed entries can significantly increase file size and complexity, and most customers find summary-level integration sufficient. If detailed entries are required, further discussion is recommended to ensure the GL is not being used as a subledger, and to explore native reporting options in Zuora.","category":"best_practice","topic":"PeopleSoft Finance Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling overpayments in Zuora when using Invoice Settlement, especially if the unapplied amount should not remain at fiscal year-end?","response":"With Invoice Settlement enabled, overpayments can be left unapplied and later applied to future invoices, effectively acting as a prepaid balance. If the business does not want to carry the unapplied amount into the next fiscal year, options include generating future invoices early and applying the payment, or creating a debit memo to consume the payment and later using a credit memo to offset it. However, creating debit memos for this purpose may not be ideal from an accounting perspective. The best practice is to leave the overpayment as a liability unless the contract allows for expiration or write-off, or to apply it to legitimate future charges. Businesses often carry cash forward into future periods, but any action should be aligned with accounting policies and contractual terms.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Overpayment Handling with Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer set up a staging environment using CSBX (Customer Sandbox) when their external system and Zuora both store linked IDs, and what are the challenges and solutions for keeping data consistent after a CSBX refresh?","response":"When both the external system and Zuora store linked IDs, refreshing CSBX can break the mapping between the two systems, as the refreshed CSBX may have different IDs. If the external system cannot be refreshed to match CSBX, the recommended approach is to define processes to update either the external system or CSBX to re-establish consistency. This may involve using developer tools to update fields in Zuora to match the external system, or updating the external system to match the refreshed CSBX. If the external system is Salesforce, a full copy sandbox can be created to mirror CSBX. However, if the external system cannot be refreshed, manual or automated processes must be established to synchronize data post-refresh. This scenario is not unique, but there are no out-of-the-box solutions; customers must plan for data reconciliation as part of their staging environment management.","category":"best_practice","topic":"CSBX Staging Environment Data Consistency"}
{"instruction":"What are the differences between MRR forecast in Zuora Billing and booking-based revenue recognition in Zuora Revenue, especially regarding future revenue visibility?","response":"MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) forecast in Zuora Billing provides a non-GAAP/IFRS view of future recurring revenue and is typically based on sales prices, excluding one-time and usage revenue. It does not account for accounting rules, one-time discounts, or SSP carves. In contrast, booking-based revenue recognition in Zuora Revenue follows GAAP/IFRS rules, includes all revenue types (recurring, one-time, usage), and considers accounting treatments such as revenue allocations and performance obligations. MRR/ARR metrics are flexible and can be calculated differently by each company, while revenue recognition is rules-driven and standardized. Therefore, MRR forecast is useful for operational forecasting, but Zuora Revenue provides a more accurate and compliant view of future revenue, especially when accounting complexities are involved.","category":"comparison","topic":"MRR Forecast vs. Revenue Recognition"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling reseller/distributor use cases in Zuora, and what general guidance is available for account hierarchy and ownership?","response":"Best practices for reseller/distributor scenarios in Zuora typically involve using the invoice owner and subscription owner features to manage billing relationships. The specific solution depends on the reseller's use case details, but account hierarchy can also play a role in structuring relationships between resellers, distributors, and end customers. CDW is a premier example of a customer using these features. General guidance is to clarify the reseller's business process and then design the account and ownership structure in Zuora to match, leveraging invoice and subscription ownership and, where appropriate, account hierarchies.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Reseller/Distributor Use Cases"}
{"instruction":"How can you mass activate all currencies for new products in Zuora, and what is an efficient way to do this for customers with many supported currencies?","response":"A simple workflow can be used to mass activate all currencies for new products in Zuora. This involves querying product rate plan IDs and sending a list of desired currencies to the /v2/plans/ API. The workflow can be set up to activate as many currencies as needed, provided they are enabled in the tenant. This approach is efficient for customers who support a large number of currencies and need to bulk update their product catalog.","category":"procedural","topic":"Mass Currency Activation for Products"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for integrating with Hyperscaler marketplaces (AWS, Azure, Google) from Zuora, and what is the recommended approach?","response":"The best practice for integrating with Hyperscaler marketplaces is to use out-of-the-box (OOTB) warehouse connectors provided by Zuora. These connectors are designed to replicate data efficiently and are cost-effective compared to building custom integrations using APIs. If an OOTB connector is not suitable, a custom solution using AQuA APIs is possible, but it is generally less efficient and more expensive. The recommended approach is to use the available connectors whenever possible, as they are maintained and updated by Zuora to support evolving data models and integration needs.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Hyperscaler Marketplace Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the options and best practices for automating the GL-file flow from Zuora to Microsoft Business Central, and is there a connector available?","response":"There is no out-of-the-box connector for Microsoft Business Central. To automate the GL-file flow, customers can use Zuora's summary GL connector to generate journal entries and place them in an FTP folder. From there, a workflow or custom integration can be built to transfer the files into Microsoft Business Central. The process typically involves exporting summary-level journal entries and using ETL or integration tools to import them into the ERP system.","category":"procedural","topic":"GL-File Automation to Microsoft Business Central"}
{"instruction":"How can you simulate payment failures in Zuora demo tenants, and what are the methods for different gateways?","response":"To simulate payment failures in Zuora demo tenants, use the test gateway's 'magic words'—specific credit card numbers or dollar amounts that trigger errors. Each gateway has its own method: for example, Chase uses specific dollar amounts, Adyen has test card numbers that always generate failures, and others provide similar test data. The sample test gateway in Zuora supports these magic words, and documentation is available for reference. For other gateways, consult the provider's knowledge center for test card numbers and error triggers.","category":"procedural","topic":"Simulating Payment Failures in Demo Tenants"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for writing off bad debt in Zuora Billing, and is there an official workflow or recommended approach?","response":"There is no single official or product-approved workflow for writing off bad debt in Zuora Billing, and customers use a variety of approaches. Some use custom workflows, while others use credit memos or bad-debt-specific rate plan charges. The choice of method can have different downstream implications in Zuora Revenue. The key is to ensure that the operations align with the company's accounting policies and reporting needs. There is interest in establishing an official best practice, but as of now, the approach varies by customer and industry.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Bad Debt Write-Off in Zuora Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can you determine if a customer is using Lockbox with Enterprise Collections in Zuora?","response":"There is no direct method mentioned for validating Lockbox usage with Enterprise Collections in Zuora. It is recommended to ask in the #collections Slack channel for more information or guidance.","category":"procedural","topic":"Lockbox Usage Validation"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for integrating Zuora with Shopify, and is there a partnership or adapter available?","response":"Historically, integrating Zuora with Shopify was not possible due to Shopify being a closed platform requiring a paid adapter and revenue share arrangement. However, there are ongoing efforts to sign a partnership agreement with Shopify, which may change the integration landscape. For the latest status, consult with the product manager or relevant stakeholders, as the situation is evolving.","category":"definitional","topic":"Zuora-Shopify Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can you handle a requirement to add an option plan for a percentage of the basic plan amount in Zuora, especially when not using Zuora CPQ and with two different plans?","response":"The simplest solution is for the ordering system (such as HubSpot or another CRM) to calculate the percentage (e.g., 20% of the basic plan) and submit the total amount to Zuora when creating the subscription. Alternatively, Zuora's Custom Logic features (currently in early access) may be used to calculate the order line ahead of time, but this requires additional configuration and may not be generally available.","category":"procedural","topic":"Option Plan Percentage Charges"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for using OneID to have multiple Zuora tenants open at the same time?","response":"To have multiple Zuora tenants open simultaneously with OneID, use different browsers (e.g., Chrome and Safari) or browser profiles. Firefox with MultiAccount Containers allows logging into OneID in separate containers, effectively creating multiple 'incognito' sessions within one browser. Chrome and Safari also support multiple profiles, enabling different settings and sessions in separate windows.","category":"best_practice","topic":"OneID Multi-Tenant Access"}
{"instruction":"How can you automate the process of activating multiple currencies for product rate plans in Zuora?","response":"A workflow can be created to query product rate plan IDs and send a list of currencies to the /v2/plans/ API, activating all desired currencies in bulk. This is especially useful for customers who support many currencies and need to update their product catalog efficiently. The workflow can be customized to target specific products or rate plans as needed.","category":"procedural","topic":"Bulk Currency Activation"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling VAT validation and tax determination in Zuora, especially for EU scenarios?","response":"Zuora's Z-Tax does not validate VAT IDs; it assumes the value entered in the Certificate ID field is valid. For tax determination, the system uses the tax exempt field and the provided certificate ID to apply exemptions. If using a third-party tax provider like Avalara or Vertex, VAT ID validation and tax determination are handled on the provider's side. When creating a customer account, the appropriate certificate ID (Danish, EU, etc.) should be entered, and the tax provider will manage exemptions and tax calculations based on the provided information.","category":"best_practice","topic":"VAT Validation and Tax Determination"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for integrating Zuora with Dynamics CRM and maintaining MDM (Master Data Management) sync?","response":"There is no specific flow diagram provided, but the integration approach is similar to how Salesforce CPQ interacts with Zuora Billing. The key is to ensure that master data objects are kept in sync between Dynamics CRM and Zuora, typically through APIs or integration middleware. The exact objects and sync logic depend on the business requirements and the integration platform used.","category":"definitional","topic":"Dynamics CRM Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for using Zuora 360 in Salesforce, and what should be avoided?","response":"Do not build business processes or customizations that rely on synchronous processes looping from Zuora into Salesforce via 360 sync. Avoid using Salesforce field updates to trigger business processes based on 360 data, as this can lead to reliability and timing issues. Instead, use purpose-built integrations or workflows that are designed for the required business logic. The key is to avoid making critical business processes dependent on the timing and reliability of the 360 sync.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Zuora 360 Best Practices"}
{"instruction":"How can you handle a scenario where you need to prorate by hours instead of days in Zuora?","response":"Zuora's rating engine does not support proration by hours out of the box. To achieve hourly proration, a custom solution using Workflow would be required, as the standard functionality only supports proration by days.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Hourly Proration in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for integrating Zuora with NetSuite, and who has NetSuite expertise within the team?","response":"Zuora does not have any former NetSuite experts on the Customer Solution Engineering team, but some team members have NetSuite experience, such as Tyler Schemmel, Matt Barston, Chad Conley, and Marc Esteve. The finance team may also have relevant expertise. For integration, consult with these individuals or the finance team for guidance.","category":"definitional","topic":"NetSuite Integration and Expertise"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling multi-phase go-live contracts in Zuora Billing and Revenue, especially when trigger dates are unpredictable?","response":"There are multiple ways to handle multi-phase go-live contracts, but none are perfect. The main challenge is managing trigger dates for revenue allocation when each phase has an unknown go-live date. Solutions may involve using one-time charges or order line items (OLIs) to represent each phase, with revenue released on booking, billing, or event as required by accounting. The setup depends on the contract structure and accounting requirements. Pending subscriptions or charges may not fully address the use case, and enhancements are being considered for future product roadmaps. Collaboration with the Revenue team and documenting requirements is recommended to influence product development.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Phase Go-Live Contracts"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for integrating Zuora with e-commerce platforms, and what is the recommended approach for customers with unique needs?","response":"Zuora offers pre-built integration frameworks for Adobe Commerce (Enterprise) and Limio (SMB). However, due to the wide variety of e-commerce providers and custom solutions, Zuora's primary approach is to provide comprehensive APIs and SDKs, enabling customers to build custom integrations tailored to their needs. This API-first strategy ensures flexibility and consistency across multiple ordering channels. There is no inherent advantage or disadvantage for any specific e-commerce provider, and customers can create consistent experiences regardless of the platform used.","category":"best_practice","topic":"E-Commerce Platform Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling split payments or payments across multiple merchant accounts in Zuora?","response":"Split payments—where a single payment is divided among multiple parties or merchant accounts—are a common request in industries like real estate, medical, and legal services. While Zuora can handle some split payment scenarios, such as co-payments or contributions from multiple parties, payment settlement across multiple merchant accounts is a more frequent and complex request. The best practice is to clarify the specific business model and payment flows, as solutions may involve courtesy bills, direct payments, or custom workflows. There is ongoing product development to address these use cases, and logging customer requests helps prioritize enhancements.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Split Payments and Merchant Account Settlement"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for automating invoice dispatch thresholds in Zuora, such as only sending invoices for balances above a certain amount?","response":"Zuora does not offer a configuration option to set an invoice dispatch threshold (e.g., only send invoices for balances above $5) out of the box, aside from the option to not send invoices at $0. To achieve this, a custom workflow can be built to check invoice balances and control dispatch. Alternatively, accounts can be placed in a batch that does not auto-process while the unbilled balance is below the threshold, or invoices can be left in draft until the cumulative balance triggers invoice generation. Custom notifications and rules may also be used to support this logic.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Dispatch Threshold Automation"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for using Standalone Orders in Zuora, and how do they integrate with Zuora Revenue?","response":"Standalone Orders allow creating and managing subscriptions and one-time orders using external product catalogs. For integration with Zuora Revenue, the request body for Standalone Orders includes fields such as 'pobPolicy,' 'productCategory,' 'productClass,' and accounting codes, which are used by Revenue for performance obligation mapping and revenue recognition. The integration depends on the revenue configuration, and as long as the required fields are present, Revenue can process the data. However, using Standalone Orders to input ad hoc data without proper structure can lead to issues, so careful planning and alignment with revenue policies are essential.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Standalone Orders and Revenue Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for integrating Zuora with Microsoft Power Platform, and are there any known limitations?","response":"AIMS360 is a known customer using Microsoft Power Platform with Zuora. While both Power Platform and Zuora claim to support OpenAPI 3.0, Microsoft implements it by upconverting OpenAPI 2.0, which may not support all features such as recursive calls. This limitation previously affected the ability to build a robust Zuora-Dynamics integration. Customers should be aware of potential compatibility issues when using Power Platform with Zuora's APIs.","category":"definitional","topic":"Microsoft Power Platform Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling minimum commitment charges that aggregate usage across multiple lines in Zuora?","response":"Minimum commitment scenarios where multiple usage lines are aggregated and compared to a minimum amount can be addressed using the Min Commit feature per billing period. Mediation can be used to accumulate usage over a defined period, but complex scenarios may require advanced transformers or aggregators. If mediation is not sufficient, custom solutions or workflows may be needed. Sharing datasets and expected outcomes with the Zuora team can help design an appropriate solution.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Aggregated Minimum Commitment Charges"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for integrating Zuora with App Stores (Apple and Google) and what guidance is available?","response":"There is no specific documentation or guidance available for integrating Zuora or Zephr with Apple and Google App Stores. Customers seeking this integration may need to explore custom solutions or consult with the product team for future roadmap updates.","category":"definitional","topic":"App Store Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for using the summary GL connector in Zuora, and what are its limitations?","response":"The summary GL connector in Zuora is generic and can be used with any ERP, but it only supports summary-level (not detailed) journal entries. The connector places JEs in an FTP folder and does not load them directly into any system. For detailed or transactional-level integration, custom workflows or ETL processes are required.","category":"definitional","topic":"Summary GL Connector Best Practices"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for automating the migration from APM (Advanced Payment Manager) to Payment Profiles in Zuora, and what is the migration plan?","response":"Payment Profiles is replacing APM and is now generally available. The migration involves moving data for customers actively using APM in production. The process is expected to be straightforward for most customers, but those with complex processing flows may require additional effort. Internal documentation is available, and communication will be sent to targeted customers with migration plans. For now, customers should wait for official migration documentation before proceeding.","category":"procedural","topic":"APM to Payment Profiles Migration"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling government compliance requirements in Zuora, such as for UK, Canada, or EU regulations?","response":"Zuora does not offer a specific government compliance solution or feature. Compliance requirements vary by region and may include data collection, segregation, and access controls. Customers should clarify their specific compliance needs, as some requirements can be addressed through configuration (e.g., data fields, access controls), while others may require custom solutions or additional products like Zuora Protect. Engaging with the product team and referencing similar customer implementations (e.g., Fortinet Federal, Delta Defense) can provide further guidance.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Government Compliance Solutions"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for integrating Zuora with IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems for payment processing, and which vendors are commonly used?","response":"Zuora APIs can be integrated with IVR and call center solutions. Vendors such as Nice (call center solution) and Sycurio (payment capture via form/IVR/chat) have been used by Zuora customers, including Toyota. These integrations typically involve using Zuora's APIs to process payments initiated through the IVR system. Documentation may not be readily available, but these vendors have experience working with Zuora customers.","category":"definitional","topic":"IVR Payment Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling multi-currency subscriptions in Zuora, and are there any known issues with Salesforce integration?","response":"To set up subscriptions in different currencies, enable the multi-currency feature in Zuora settings. When creating an order, select the desired currency for each subscription. However, there is a known bug where subscriptions are synchronized to Salesforce using the account currency, which may not reflect the actual subscription currency. Customers should be aware of this limitation and monitor for updates or fixes from the product team.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Currency Subscription Setup"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for using the new API versioning scheme in Zuora, and what should customers be aware of when upgrading?","response":"Zuora has moved to a date-based API versioning scheme, with the latest version being 2024-05-20. Customers can specify the desired version using the 'zuora-version' request header. A new administration setting allows viewing and upgrading the API version for each tenant. It is recommended to upgrade to the latest version before any coding begins in a new tenant. However, do not upgrade existing tenants until all backward-incompatible changes have been tested, as the new version may affect existing integrations. There are no outbound communications planned for this change, so customers should consult release notes and internal communications for guidance.","category":"best_practice","topic":"API Versioning in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling insurance modeling in Zuora's native product catalog, and what are the common approaches?","response":"Insurance modeling in Zuora is often handled outside of Zuora in the customer's own platform, with the annual premium passed to Zuora as the list base price. Zuora then calculates the billing amount based on the selected billing period (e.g., monthly). While Zuora supports tiers, formulas, and attribute-based pricing, many insurance-specific calculations (e.g., policy equity, unearned premium) are managed in external systems. The main challenge is differentiating Zuora from a payment processor when the customer calculates amounts externally. Payment plans for policies (e.g., $1000 for 6 months paid as $166.66/month) are typically managed as payment schedules.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Insurance Modeling in Product Catalog"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for using attribute-based pricing in Zuora, and what are the limitations regarding subscription amendments?","response":"Attribute-based pricing in Zuora performs a lookup at the time of subscription creation or amendment. However, if a custom field driving the pricing logic changes mid-contract without an order or amendment affecting the product, the price is not automatically reevaluated. Only an order or amendment that directly affects the product will trigger a price reevaluation. This design prevents unintended price changes due to non-contractual updates. Future versions of the contextual catalog aim to address these limitations by centralizing price logic. Workarounds may be needed for current use cases, and product feedback is being collected for future enhancements.","category":"definitional","topic":"Attribute-Based Pricing Limitations"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for using the Beehive team for customer analysis and optimization in Zuora?","response":"The Beehive team can run analyses to provide optimization options for customers, sometimes leading to a need for Product Bundle Engineering (PBE). Engaging the Beehive team is recommended for customers seeking insights and optimization strategies.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Beehive Team Analysis and Optimization"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for integrating Zuora with HighRadius for AR/collections, and which customers are known to use this integration?","response":"Zillow uses HighRadius for dunning and lockbox payments, and Zoom uses it similarly. These are reference customers for HighRadius integration with Zuora, primarily for collections-related processes.","category":"definitional","topic":"HighRadius Integration References"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for handling custom Python scripts in Zuora workflows hosted on AWS Lambda, and what issues may arise?","response":"Custom Python scripts in Zuora workflows hosted on AWS Lambda may encounter compatibility issues if the AWS environment falls out of sync with required Python library versions. Troubleshooting involves identifying the tenant ID, workflow name, and run number, and working with support and engineering teams. If issues persist, redesigning and re-implementing the workflow may be necessary, but understanding the root cause is important for long-term stability.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Custom Python Scripts in Workflows"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for using ZCPQ (Zuora CPQ) with Salesforce Shield (encryption), and is there confirmation of compatibility?","response":"There is no confirmation available regarding the compatibility of ZCPQ with Salesforce Shield (encryption). Further investigation or testing in an environment with Shield enabled is recommended to confirm functionality.","category":"definitional","topic":"ZCPQ and Salesforce Shield Compatibility"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for provisioning and entitlement solutions that work with Zuora, especially for IoT scenarios with offline devices?","response":"Common provisioning and entitlement solutions that integrate with Zuora include Thales and Flexera. Other platforms such as Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service, Kaa IoT Platform, thinger.io, and SiteWhere have been identified, but they do not support offline provisioning and rely heavily on connectivity for data transmission and analytics. Many customers use homegrown systems for provisioning in IoT scenarios, especially when offline support is required.","category":"definitional","topic":"Provisioning and Entitlement Solutions for IoT"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for setting up a demo for Dynamic Usage Charges in Zuora, and what should be considered?","response":"Dynamic Usage Charges are in early access (EA), so coordination with the product manager is required for demos. Some team members have experience running dynamic usage at the account level in their tenants. It is recommended to review the use case with the product manager to ensure alignment and support. Additional guidance may be available in the #C04ADTAKJCX Slack channel.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Dynamic Usage Charges Demo Setup"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for tracking connector refresh intervals and character support in Zuora's data warehouse integrations?","response":"Zuora's connector to data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery) currently supports refresh on a regular interval (24 hours), with plans to release shorter refresh frequencies. There is no on-demand refresh option at this time. Regarding character support, there is no formal documentation specifying which characters are supported, and customers seeking to align validation across services may need to work with Zuora support or product teams for clarification.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Warehouse Connector Refresh and Character Support"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for automating the GL-file flow from Zuora to Microsoft Business Central, and is there a connector available?","response":"There is no out-of-the-box connector for Microsoft Business Central. To automate the GL-file flow, customers can use Zuora's summary GL connector to generate journal entries and place them in an FTP folder. From there, a workflow or custom integration can be built to transfer the files into Microsoft Business Central. The process typically involves exporting summary-level journal entries and using ETL or integration tools to import them into the ERP system.","category":"procedural","topic":"GL-File Automation to Microsoft Business Central"}
{"instruction":"How can we avoid duplication in the revenue stage when migrating evergreen subscriptions using automation tools that trigger invoice APIs for each order, resulting in multiple booking transactions and performance issues?","response":"When migrating evergreen subscriptions using automation tools (such as Doyen), triggering the invoice API for each order can result in multiple draft invoices and, consequently, multiple booking transactions in the revenue stage. This can cause performance issues due to the high volume of transactions. To mitigate this, consider the following best practices: 1) Review at which object level the migration flag is being applied. 2) If possible, load all accounts and orders first, then run the Bill Run API at the end, rather than after each order. 3) If Bill Run must be invoked after each order, ensure it is triggered for the specific subscription to avoid unnecessary duplication. 4) Examine the rules or logic used to invoke the Bill Run API and adjust them to minimize redundant invoice creation. If the current process cannot be changed (e.g., Run Billing is included in the Orders Load), document the behavior and consult with the invoicing team for further optimization. This approach helps reduce duplication and improves performance during migration.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"evergreen subscription migration duplication"}
{"instruction":"What is the relationship between the stage table and Order Line Item (OLI) in OTR, and how can they be joined?","response":"In OTR, if the customer is using the stage table, there is a direct relationship between a line in the stage table and an Order Line Item (OLI). Specifically, the salesorderlineid in the stage table can be joined with the salesorderlineid in the booking transaction, which is the same as the id in the Order Line Item object. This allows for straightforward data reconciliation and analysis between these objects.","category":"definitional","topic":"stage table and OLI relationship"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for refreshing an OTR environment to avoid data inconsistency?","response":"When refreshing an OTR environment, it is recommended to refresh both the billing and revenue environments. This ensures data consistency between the two systems, especially after OTR has been enabled. Failing to refresh both can lead to mismatches and inconsistencies in data, which may impact downstream processes.","category":"best_practice","topic":"OTR environment refresh"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to bring in a negative charge (discount) as a ramp in Zuora Revenue (ZR) during data migration, so that it is spread over multiple years like a positive charge?","response":"While negative ramps (discounts spread over time) are supported in Zuora Billing (ZB), it is unclear if this is fully supported in Zuora Revenue (ZR). There is a scenario where a negative charge with a shorter term is being applied all at once instead of being spread over multiple years during migration. The question remains open as to whether negative charge ramps can be brought into ZR in the same way as positive charges, and if anyone has successfully implemented this. Further investigation or confirmation from product experts may be required.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"negative charge ramp in ZR"}
{"instruction":"How does OTR determine the exchange rate date when invoice date and posting date differ in Zuora Billing?","response":"In OTR integration, the exchange rate is determined using the invoice date, which serves as the document date. This may differ from Zuora Billing, which uses the earlier of the invoice date and posted date to derive the exchange rate. However, there is some discussion suggesting that the behavior may align with Zuora Billing and FIN, using the earlier of the two dates. It is important to confirm the exact configuration in your environment, but by default, OTR uses the invoice date for exchange rate determination.","category":"definitional","topic":"OTR exchange rate date determination"}
{"instruction":"Can a custom field (e.g., DealID__c) be mapped from both Invoice and Credit Memo objects to the same ATR field in Zuora Revenue, and what are the limitations or risks of doing this via API?","response":"Mapping a custom field like DealID__c from both Invoice and Credit Memo objects to the same ATRXX field in Zuora Revenue is not supported through the UI, though it is allowed for InvoiceItem and CreditMemoItem. If you force this mapping via API (e.g., using Postman), be aware that Invoice and Credit Memo are non-overlapping objects, so custom fields from Invoice are not inherited by Credit Memo. The main risks include potential data integrity issues and running out of available attributes if separate fields are used. If you proceed with the API workaround, ensure you understand the product limitations and monitor for any unintended impacts on grouping or data synchronization.","category":"procedural","topic":"custom field mapping Invoice and Credit Memo"}
{"instruction":"Is Order upgrade along with Invoice Settlement a mandatory requirement when moving to OTR, or is it optional?","response":"Order upgrade and Invoice Settlement are independent features in OTR. OTR supports both, but neither is mandatory when moving to OTR. You can choose to enable one, both, or neither based on your business requirements.","category":"definitional","topic":"order upgrade and invoice settlement in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What should be done if a CAD transaction fails in data collection with the error 'RPRO‑00076: The transaction is not processed due to missing F Ex Rate and/or G Ex rate' in Zuora Revenue?","response":"First, check if the transaction is future-dated, as exchange rates may not be available for future dates. If not, verify when the order was created and when the exchange rates were synced to billing. For transactions where the order date is in the future, the exchange-rate provider (e.g., Oanda) cannot supply a rate, causing the booking transaction to fail. Once the invoice is generated with a valid date, the required exchange rate should be available. To avoid such errors, do not use a future date as the order/booking date; instead, use the current date for the order/booking and set the effective date as needed. If the issue persists, ensure that revenue rates are loaded for booking transactions and consider voiding future-dated orders if necessary.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"CAD transaction FX rate error"}
{"instruction":"Do Booking Transaction and Billing Transaction objects get updated when an Order and its related objects are deleted in Zuora?","response":"If booking or billing transactions have already been generated, they will not be deleted automatically when an Order or its related objects are deleted. This is by design, and deletion of orders is generally not recommended except in lower environments for testing. If you need to perform completeness checks between Zuora Billing and Zuora Revenue, be aware of this behavior.","category":"definitional","topic":"booking and billing transaction deletion"}
{"instruction":"Can subscriptions from different orgs in Zuora Billing be grouped into a single revenue contract in Zuora Revenue, and what are the implications?","response":"Subscriptions from different orgs in Zuora Billing can be grouped into a single revenue contract in Zuora Revenue, but only if you have a single org setup in Revenue and a common attribute on both subscriptions. When performing allocations on such a revenue contract, be aware that intercompany accounting entries may be generated if contract modifications span different company codes. Additionally, LTST (Latest Transaction Start Time) is performed at the sob_id level, so running LTST will result in multiple journals if multiple companies are involved.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi-org revenue contract grouping"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for handling a scenario where a cancellation is performed on a subscription at its original term end date in Zuora Billing after OTR enablement?","response":"If a cancellation is performed at the original term end date, it is treated as a non-impacting event in Zuora Revenue, since the subscription was already scheduled to end naturally. No booking transactions are created by OTR in this case. Only cancellations performed before the original end date (during the effective term) will result in booking transactions that reduce obligation/TCV. Cancellations after the original end date also do not create booking transactions, as the subscription has already ended.","category":"definitional","topic":"cancellation at term end in OTR"}
{"instruction":"Does a Billing subscription status of 'ACTIVE (OUT OF TERM)' affect the sync of booking transactions to Zuora Revenue?","response":"A Billing subscription status of 'ACTIVE (OUT OF TERM)' should not affect the sync of booking transactions to Zuora Revenue. If booking transactions are generated in Billing but not showing up in Revenue, check for exclusion flags, order actions, and field mappings. In one case, a custom field (FV_ELIGIBLE_FLAG) with a value length issue caused the sync to fail. Removing the problematic mapping resolved the issue. Always ensure custom field mappings comply with expected formats and lengths.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"booking transaction sync with ACTIVE (OUT OF TERM) status"}
{"instruction":"How can usage be recognized as revenue in Zuora Revenue before invoicing, and what are the requirements?","response":"To recognize usage as revenue before invoicing in Zuora Revenue, ensure the following: 1) The 'right to bill' flag is set to 'Y'. 2) Unbilled usage is supported in Billing for the charge model used. 3) There are records in the Rev Rec events transaction table in Billing. 4) The POB template is set to 'Consumption Usage (Non-Committed)'. 5) Run the Usage master process (or Usage to Revenue conversion process) to recognize revenue prior to billing. Without running this process, usage will not be recognized as revenue before invoicing.","category":"procedural","topic":"usage revenue recognition before invoicing"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between the Regenerate and Data Migration (DM) options in OTR, and how should they be used for sample or subset data loads?","response":"Regenerate and Data Migration (DM) are two distinct processes in OTR. Regenerate pulls all data for a given subscription, invoice, or credit, and is best used for sample or subset data loads (e.g., for testing a small number of subscriptions). DM applies its own rules on which charges and versions to pull (except for evergreen subscriptions, where it pulls everything) and is designed for full data migrations. For sample testing or loading a subset of subscriptions, use the Regenerate API. DM is intended for comprehensive data migration and will pull all relevant data based on its logic.","category":"procedural","topic":"regenerate vs data migration in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and lessons learned for data migration from NetSuite to Zuora Billing & Revenue (OTR), specifically regarding whether to migrate all historical contracts or only active ones?","response":"When migrating from NetSuite to Zuora Billing & Revenue (OTR), a key decision is whether to migrate a complete snapshot of all historical contracts/subscriptions or focus only on in-flight (active) contracts. Migrating all historical data retains full transactional history for audit and reporting but increases complexity and post-cutover processing. Migrating only active contracts streamlines the process but may limit historical reporting. The choice depends on audit requirements, reporting needs, and the complexity your organization is willing to manage post-migration. Consider implementing a pre- and post-migration reconciliation framework to compare Billing, Revenue, and Legacy data for quantities, amounts, and POB assignments, and to flag any unmatched revenue contracts or events. Audit-friendly delta reports showing differences between legacy and transformed values are also recommended.","category":"best_practice","topic":"data migration strategy NetSuite to Zuora"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for handling duplicate accounting codes (active and inactive) during data migration and backfill in Zuora Billing and Revenue?","response":"If duplicate accounting codes (one active, one inactive) exist, the backfill process may not distinguish between them, leading to ambiguity about which code is used. The recommended approach is to change the name of the inactive accounting code to ensure uniqueness. If the UI does not allow editing the inactive code, a database-level update may be required, tracked via an L3 support ticket. For long-term enhancement, the OTR integration layer should respect the active/inactive status of accounting codes. In the short term, coordinate with support to rename inactive codes and avoid issues during migration and backfill.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"duplicate accounting codes in migration"}
{"instruction":"How can we monitor and improve the performance of OTR data migration and backfill jobs, and what should be done if jobs appear stuck or slow?","response":"To monitor OTR data migration and backfill jobs, use the backfill dashboards to check for errors and job status. If a job appears stuck or is taking unusually long, verify the volume of data (e.g., number of subscription versions) and check for duplicate data in upload files, as this can significantly slow down processing. If the job status does not update correctly but the data is processed, you may proceed with subsequent steps (e.g., updating PRPCs via CSV). For sample or subset data loads, use the Regenerate API instead of full data migration. If issues persist, escalate to support and consider manual workarounds, such as updating job status or resubmitting clean data files.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"OTR data migration and backfill performance"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling additional revenue fields (e.g., Product Family) in the Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) object for API operations, and what should be done if an 'invalid field for query' error occurs?","response":"To use additional revenue fields like Product Family in the PRPC object via API, ensure that the 'EnableAdditionalRevenueFields' property is enabled for the tenant. This feature is typically enabled for OTR customers. If you encounter an 'invalid field for query' error, confirm that the feature is enabled by using the correct API endpoint and parameter ('tenantIds' instead of 'tenantid'). If the error persists, create a support ticket to have the feature enabled for the relevant tenant.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"enabling additional revenue fields in PRPC API"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer map a custom field from a usage event in Zuora Billing to a revenue segment in Zuora Revenue, and what are the current limitations?","response":"Currently, there is no option to map custom fields from usage records in Zuora Billing to revenue segments in Zuora Revenue via OTR. The assumption is that all required information should be available in Zuora Billing. If not, customers can use the upload functionality in Revenue to stamp the required accounting segment and upload using consumption upload, but this is amount-based, not quantity-based. There is no roadmap commitment for supporting this mapping directly in OTR at this time.","category":"definitional","topic":"usage custom field mapping to revenue segment"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for handling Fixed Amount Discounts (FAD) with line-level allocation in OTR, and what are the limitations of the available processing options?","response":"For processing Fixed Amount Discounts (FAD) with line-level allocation in OTR, there are four options in the interface settings. Options 2 (Generate Actual value in Booking Transaction) and 4 (Generate Actual Amount as a Standalone Booking Line) are appropriate for supporting discount lines in revenue. However, Option 2 has limitations when FAD is applied to usage or evergreen subscriptions, as it may not work correctly. Option 4 can be used, but you should verify if there are any additional limitations for your specific scenario. Always test the chosen option to ensure it meets your requirements.","category":"best_practice","topic":"FAD processing with line-level allocation in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How should the expiry of a prepaid balance be handled for revenue recognition in Zuora Revenue when the recognition timing is based on consumption?","response":"The expiry of a prepaid balance does not automatically trigger a revenue event in Zuora Revenue. To recognize revenue upon expiry, use the Deplete Funds API when billing for the period after the fund expiry. This creates a record under PPDD balance and a revenue recognition event for release, dated to the last day of the validity period. If there is no billing after expiry, the expiry behavior must be explicitly managed at the POB level or through manual processes.","category":"procedural","topic":"prepaid balance expiry revenue recognition"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for bulk regenerating booking transactions in OTR, and what permissions are required?","response":"To bulk regenerate booking transactions in OTR, use the regenerate APIs, which allow for bulk operations beyond the UI's single-subscription regeneration capability. The 'Manage OTR Transactions Regeneration' role is required to perform these actions. This approach is useful for correcting data issues across multiple subscriptions.","category":"procedural","topic":"bulk regeneration of booking transactions in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the impact of the 'ACTIVE (OUT OF TERM)' status on booking transaction sync, and how can field mapping issues affect this process?","response":"The 'ACTIVE (OUT OF TERM)' status should not inherently block booking transaction sync to Zuora Revenue. However, field mapping issues, such as using a custom field (e.g., FV_ELIGIBLE_FLAG) with a value length exceeding the expected maximum, can cause sync failures. Removing or correcting problematic field mappings resolves the issue and allows bookings to sync as expected.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"booking transaction sync and field mapping issues"}
{"instruction":"How should a customer handle a scenario where a transaction line fails in Zuora Revenue with the error 'The transaction line is not processed as the revenue end date is before the revenue start date' during data migration?","response":"This error often occurs when the end date in Zuora Billing is set to start date plus one day, but in Zuora Revenue, the end date is interpreted as start date minus one, causing the record to fail. For discount recurring charges, check the 'apply to charge end date' setting in Billing, as in Zuora Billing the end date is not included. Adjust the configuration to ensure the end date is handled correctly during migration.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"revenue end date before start date error in migration"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for reconciling data between Zuora Billing, Zuora Revenue, and legacy systems during and after migration?","response":"Implement a pre- and post-migration reconciliation framework to compare quantities, amounts, and POB assignments across Billing, Revenue, and legacy data. Use audit-friendly delta reports to highlight differences between legacy and transformed values, and flag any unmatched revenue contracts or events. This approach ensures data integrity and supports audit requirements.","category":"best_practice","topic":"migration reconciliation framework"}
{"instruction":"How can the performance of OTR data migration be improved, and what factors affect migration speed?","response":"OTR data migration performance can be improved by requesting a dedicated queue for the tenant, batching transactions to optimal data collection sizes, and sequencing data collection appropriately. The processing time for subscriptions is typically much longer than for invoices or memos, so the migration percentage may not be linear. Monitoring the backfill dashboard and addressing any duplicate or erroneous data in upload files also helps maintain migration speed. If jobs are stuck or slow, escalate to support and consider resubmitting clean data files.","category":"best_practice","topic":"OTR data migration performance"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling the ZBilling Finance > Revenue Recognition feature in an eOTR/UNO tenant, and what are the implications for OLIs flowing from CPQX to Billing?","response":"To enable the ZBilling Finance > Revenue Recognition feature in an eOTR/UNO tenant, follow the instructions in the tenant's UI or consult with your Zuora administrator. Enabling this feature allows Order Line Items (OLIs) to flow from CPQX to Billing, which is necessary for demos or integrations involving ZRevenue.

Always check for duplicates before submitting large data files for backfill.","category":"best_practice","topic":"duplicate data in OTR backfill jobs"}
{"instruction":"How should a customer handle a scenario where a negative invoice (IIA or CM) is created in Billing as part of data migration, and will these be available in Zuora Revenue?","response":"If Invoice Item Adjustments (IIA) and Credit Memos (CM) are created in Billing as part of data migration for negative invoices, they should also be available in Zuora Revenue, provided the integration and data sync processes are configured correctly. Ensure that the migration includes these transaction types and verify their presence in Revenue after migration.","category":"definitional","topic":"negative invoice migration to Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for mapping the invoice number from Credit Memo Item (CMI) to a revenue attribute in OTR, and are there any enhancements related to this?","response":"An enhancement in OTR allows the invoice number to be mapped from the Credit Memo Item (CMI) to a revenue attribute, as long as the CMI originates from the invoice item. The mapping should be done in the billing transaction, where the invoice number can be mapped to any revenue attribute. There is no separate field for invoice number under Credit Memo Item source in 'Manage Revenue Fields Mapping'; instead, use the invoice number from the billing transaction.","category":"procedural","topic":"invoice number mapping from CMI in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling booking transaction data in a sandbox tenant for K2 customers, and what are the limitations?","response":"For K2 customers, booking transaction data is typically only available in the production tenant and is controlled by a feature flag. To enable booking transaction data in a sandbox tenant (e.g., CSBX), submit a request to the UNO team to enable the feature for the specific tenant. Note that this enablement is per tenant and not automatic.

{"instruction":"How can I identify cancelled subscriptions directly in Zuora Revenue instead of Zuora Billing?","response":"If there is no change to any of the charges under the subscription when it is cancelled, the transactions will not be pushed to revenue. This means that cancelled subscriptions may not be directly identifiable in Revenue unless the cancellation triggers a change in the charges that results in a transaction being sent to Revenue. In such cases, you may need to rely on the presence or absence of transactions related to the subscription in Revenue to infer its cancellation status.","category":"definitional","topic":"identifying cancelled subscriptions in Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How do I map multiple custom fields from different objects in Zuora Billing to the same attribute column in Zuora Revenue?","response":"You can map custom fields from both the Order Line Item (OLI) and Rate Plan Charge (RPC) levels to the same attribute (e.g., atr20) in Zuora Revenue, but this is only supported in the Booking template. The same attribute mapping for both RPC and OLI is not supported in the Billing template; for Billing transactions, only Invoice Item (II) and Memo Item can be mapped. This limitation means that if you need to map the same attribute from both RPC and OLI, you must use the Booking template.","category":"procedural","topic":"custom field mapping between ZB and ZR"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for performing a catch-up bill run (CUBR) for new OTR customers, and what are the implications for revenue recognition?","response":"For new OTR customers (i.e., those using both new Zuora Billing and new Zuora Revenue), the recommended approach for a catch-up bill run (CUBR) is to advance the bill run target date to the cutover date and then process the output invoices, typically by generating credit memos or external payments. This ensures that Zuora Billing does not re-bill amounts already billed in the legacy system. The alternative method, which uses a setting to update all charges to the target date without generating invoices, is less flexible and not commonly used for GS migrations. The migration procedure does not change for OTR versus K2; the standard approach is preferred for its flexibility and alignment with revenue recognition requirements.","category":"best_practice","topic":"catch-up bill run (CUBR) for OTR customers"}
{"instruction":"How should the SO_Date be set for migrated subscriptions in OTR integrations to ensure data is collected in the intended first open period in Zuora Revenue?","response":"In OTR integrations, the SO_Date should be set to the order date in Zuora Billing. During data migration, you must set the SO_Date in Billing to align with the first open period in Zuora Revenue. If the SO_Date and the open period in Revenue are aligned, the data will be collected as intended. However, when planning this, consider not just data collection but also factors like balances, currency conversion, SSPs, and the customer's reporting needs.","category":"best_practice","topic":"SO_Date handling for OTR data migration"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to map a custom field in Zuora Billing to the standard Ship To Country field in Zuora Revenue using OTR mapping?","response":"You can only map custom fields from Zuora Billing to revenue attributes in Zuora Revenue, not directly to standard fields like Ship To Country. If you need to map a custom field to Ship To Country, you must first map it to a revenue attribute and then use that attribute as needed within Zuora Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"custom field mapping to Ship To Country"}
{"instruction":"What is the behavior of fixed-amount discounts (FAD) in Zuora Revenue when a subscription is cancelled? Will the revenue end date for the FAD be updated?","response":"For fixed-amount discounts (FAD), Zuora Revenue does not update the Revenue Start/End dates upon cancellation. The revenue dates for FAD always follow the related recurring charge, and any cancellation impact is reflected through a credit memo (CM-C) rather than by changing the discount line's revenue dates. Proration of FAD charges is not supported, so the booking value may differ from the actual billing amount. If the main charge cancellation line is not created in the booking transaction in Billing, it may be due to a Billing setting, but this does not affect the expected behavior for FAD in Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"fixed-amount discount behavior on cancellation"}
{"instruction":"How can I identify the journal entries created for system-generated CM-C transactions in Zuora Revenue?","response":"You can identify journal entries for system-generated CM-C transactions by joining the RC bill and RC Schedule tables using the original line ID. This approach is similar to how you would query for any credit memo (CM) in the system.","category":"procedural","topic":"journal entry identification for CM-C transactions"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended way to handle partial credits for overage invoices in OTR, and how should these be recognized in revenue?","response":"When a partial credit is issued for an overage invoice, Zuora Revenue will receive a standalone negative invoice, which creates a sales order line with a usage-based POB. Since Zuora Billing does not send negative usage for credits, the best practice is to identify these credits and assign them to a different POB (other than usage-based event) if immediate release is required. The recognition of such credits should be discussed with the user to ensure the desired outcome, as the default behavior is to treat them as usage-based and release accordingly.","category":"best_practice","topic":"partial credit handling for overage invoices in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How do I regenerate invoice transactions to push them into Zuora Revenue stage again, similar to how it's done for charge lines?","response":"You can use the Regenerate Billing Transaction API to regenerate invoice transactions and push them into the Zuora Revenue stage again, similar to the process for charge lines. This API allows you to reprocess invoice data as needed for data migration or correction purposes.","category":"procedural","topic":"regenerating invoice transactions for ZR stage"}
{"instruction":"What is the impact of changing the account code on the product catalog definition for renewal lines in OTR? Will renewal lines pick up the new account code?","response":"In OTR, changing the account code on the product catalog definition will only affect new rate plan charges (RPCs), not existing ones. For the same RPC, when a new segment is generated (such as for a renewal period), it will still use the existing accounting code in the RPC. If you need renewal lines to pick up the new account code, you can use the data backfill tool or update the Chart of Accounts (COA) in Zuora Billing with the OTR framework. However, this assumes a 1:1 mapping between old and new accounts and may require additional data fixes in Zuora Revenue to ensure in-flight schedules are in sync.","category":"best_practice","topic":"account code changes for renewals in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How do I perform a completeness check between booking and billing systems for an OTR customer to ensure all eligible records have synced and been collected?","response":"For Billing, use the Billing Report (excluding CM-C) and compare it to the Billing Transaction Object's Document Number and Document Date fields in Data Sources. For Booking, use the Booking Report with Updated Date and compare it to the Booking Transaction object using Subscription Name, Sales Order Line ID, and Subscription last booking date in Data Sources. Apply a date filter for the current open period in revenue to ensure you are checking the relevant records. These steps help verify that all eligible records have been properly synced and collected between the systems.","category":"procedural","topic":"completeness check between booking and billing in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for handling negative charges in billing for OTR customers?","response":"Negative one-time and recurring charges are supported in OTR, but negative usage charges are not. If a customer has a use case involving negative charges, it is important to understand the reason for the negative charge. For example, a credit may be used to offset a setup fee or provide a discount. When allocations are not involved, negative charges are generally not an issue, but if allocations are planned in the future, further review may be needed.","category":"best_practice","topic":"negative charges handling in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How do I update the revenue (booking and billing) treatment and status of revenue contract lines when a historical cancelled subscription is pulled in as part of data migration using the Regenerate API?","response":"There is no direct relation between the cancellation of a subscription and its revenue treatment; it depends on the POB (Performance Obligation) setup. When a historical cancelled subscription is pulled in using the Regenerate API, the revenue treatment and status of the revenue contract lines are determined by the POB configuration, not by the cancellation status itself.","category":"definitional","topic":"revenue treatment for cancelled subscriptions in data migration"}
{"instruction":"How do I identify whether data was pushed to Revenue stage by OTR or by manual execution of the Regenerate API?","response":"There is a flag that indicates whether data was pushed to Revenue stage by OTR or by manual execution of the Regenerate API. When forceful regeneration is used (either via UI or API), the flag should be set to 'Y'. If you observe the flag as 'N' after regeneration, this may indicate an issue, and a support ticket should be raised for further investigation.","category":"procedural","topic":"identifying data source for Revenue stage records"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended way to handle split segments for renewals and amendments when using Salesforce CPQ with Zuora Billing and Zuora Revenue OTR?","response":"Split segments should be enabled even if renewals and amendments come from Salesforce CPQ. The new term is expected to be represented as a separate sales order line in revenue. This ensures that renewals and amendments are properly tracked and accounted for in Zuora Revenue, regardless of the source system for the amendment.","category":"best_practice","topic":"split segment handling for renewals/amendments with Salesforce CPQ"}
{"instruction":"How do I perform data backfill for Rate Plan Charge data in OTR, and can I execute multiple batches in parallel?","response":"You can execute multiple batches for Rate Plan Charge data backfill in OTR at the same time, provided there is no overlap of data between the batches. Running multiple batches in parallel will impact the overall processing power and resource allocation due to multi-threading, but it should not affect the integrity of the data being updated as long as the batches are distinct.","category":"procedural","topic":"parallel data backfill for Rate Plan Charge in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the behavior of the Regenerate API when used without the SUBSCRIPTIONVERSION parameter, and how does it determine which versions to bring?","response":"When using the Regenerate API without the SUBSCRIPTIONVERSION parameter, only impacted sales order lines (SO lines) will be generated for each version. 'Impacted' means lines where revenue-impacting changes occurred, such as changes to start date, end date, or contractual value (CCV). If nothing changed in a version, the SO line for that version will not be generated. For billing transactions, the booking version is provided. If an invoice or credit memo exists for a specific version that was skipped, the system will provide the booking version associated with the billing transaction.","category":"definitional","topic":"Regenerate API behavior for subscription versions"}
{"instruction":"How do I handle functional currency being sent as blank in OTR integration, and what should I check?","response":"If functional currency is sent as blank in OTR integration, check whether it is also blank in the Booking and Billing data sources in Billing, or just in the Stage table. Also, verify if the home currency was configured after creating subscriptions, and whether the FX rate is configured. Creating a sample subscription after configuring the home currency can help determine if the issue persists. Always test before confirming it as an issue.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"functional currency blank in OTR integration"}
{"instruction":"How do I handle the scenario where the same subscription ID appears across two different orders in Zuora Billing?","response":"The same subscription ID can be reused across multiple orders if one version is created and another is subsequently deleted. This is related to deleted orders, and deleting orders is not a best practice. Instead, counter-processes such as de-book and rebook, invoice reversal, or amendments should be used to correct order creation errors. The use case for order deletion should be carefully reviewed, as it can lead to unexpected behaviors like subscription ID reuse.","category":"best_practice","topic":"subscription ID reuse across orders"}
{"instruction":"How do I update Standalone Credit Memo Detail to perform data backfill actions in Zuora Revenue?","response":"The specific procedural steps for updating Standalone Credit Memo Detail to perform data backfill actions were not provided in the discussion.

The expert requested more context to provide a tailored response, indicating that the solution may depend on additional details about the use case.","category":"procedural","topic":"partial revenue posting from Zuora Billing"}
{"instruction":"How do I handle delays in data appearing in staging after activating subscriptions and running regeneration in CSBX tenants?","response":"Delays in data appearing in staging after activating subscriptions and running regeneration can be caused by a backlog of pending messages in the processing queue. For example, a queue with about 10,000 pending messages may take around 10 minutes to be consumed. If the delay is urgent (e.g., for a demo), check the tenant ID and coordinate with the support team to monitor and expedite processing. Issues with Postman API returning success but not delivering data to Revenue Inbound may also be related to these processing delays. Once the backlog is cleared, the issue should resolve.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"delays in data staging after regeneration"}
{"instruction":"How do I identify the reason for missing defer/revenue accounting segments on $0 Fixed-Amount Discount (FAD) lines during migration, when they are populated correctly on invoice lines?","response":"Missing defer/revenue accounting segments on $0 FAD lines is due to product catalog setup. Check the relevant settings in the Product Catalog, specifically under the finance section, as these settings drive the population of accounting codes. The checkbox under finance determines whether the codes are populated. If the codes are missing on FAD lines but present on invoice lines, review and adjust the product catalog configuration accordingly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"missing accounting segments on FAD lines"}
{"instruction":"How do I handle the scenario where functional currency and exchange rates are missing in booking transactions and stage tables in OTR integration?","response":"If functional currency and exchange rates are missing in booking transactions and stage tables, verify whether the home currency was configured after creating subscriptions. If so, this may be the cause. Create a sample subscription after configuring the home currency to test if the issue persists. Also, ensure that FX rates are configured. Testing with new data after configuration changes can help determine if the problem is resolved.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"missing functional currency and exchange rates in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How do I handle the scenario where deleted orders and amendments result in errors in the data collection batch, but deleted cancellations do not?","response":"Deleted orders and amendments result in an error message 'Deleted Transaction' during data collection, while deleted cancellations may be collected with a message indicating they are not consumed due to the configuration for 'CONSUME_DELETED_TRANSACTION'. If data was collected before this profile was enabled, revenue may be incorrect in Zuora Revenue.

In such cases, a support ticket should be raised for further investigation and resolution.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Regenerate API regenerated_flag behavior"}
{"instruction":"How do I handle the scenario where the chargecontractualvalue object in Zuora Billing is deprecated for OTR-enabled customers?","response":"Once OTR is enabled, it is recommended to use the booking transaction object instead of the chargecontractualvalue (CCV) object, as the CCV amount may differ and the table is only used for K2. The CCV table may stop populating data after OTR is enabled, and there is no set timeline for its removal in production.

{"instruction":"Explain how credit card surcharges are handled in Zuora Revenue, including whether surcharges and their refunds flow to revenue, and any recent changes to this process.","response":"Credit card surcharges in Zuora Revenue are typically handled as additional fees charged to customers, often applied at the invoice level as a debit memo (DM). When a surcharge is applied, it is consumed as an invoice and flows to revenue unless an 'exclude' flag is configured. If the exclude flag is not set, both the surcharge and any refund will flow to revenue. However, users can only perform an unapply and refund action for surcharges. In this case, both the surcharge and the original invoice are unapplied and refunded. The surcharge DM is automatically written off as a result of the unapply and refund, ensuring it does not reopen for collection in future payment runs. There have been no recent changes to the revenue process for surcharges; the design remains as described. The exclude flag can be configured to prevent surcharges or their reversals from flowing to revenue if desired.","category":"procedural","topic":"credit card surcharges in revenue"}
{"instruction":"Describe the best way to support usage-based credits, such as SLA credits based on transaction volume, in Zuora Revenue, and how to process these when negative usage charges are not recognized as revenue.","response":"To support usage-based credits like SLA credits (e.g., a rebate if a chargeback rate drops below a set level over a rolling period), mediation can calculate the credit and create a usage charge. Zuora Billing supports creating a usage charge with a negative per unit price (e.g., 250 transactions at -$0.03 per transaction = -$7.50). This approach allows the credit to be processed as a negative usage charge, which is supported in billing. However, revenue cannot recognize usage charges that are negative amounts directly. The recommended solution is to have mediation calculate the credit and create a usage charge with a negative per unit price in billing, which will then be processed accordingly. If further processing is needed in revenue, a credit memo or other adjustment may be required based on the mediation calculation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"usage-based credits and negative usage charges"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for redoing ZR Org mapping in Zuora Billing, and what should be done if edit options are unavailable?","response":"To redo the ZR Org mapping in Zuora Billing, you can raise a support ticket with the billing team. If you have disabled the default org and created a new org, mapped it to all entities, and are unable to open periods or edit the org mapping, the recommended approach is to contact support. This is intentional design, and changes to org mapping are considered a project that must go through the proper process via support.

The issue is that CM-ROs inherit exchange rates from sales orders instead of the originating invoices, which can result in significant FX differences. This issue has been resolved in the Q2 release, but for impact analysis, some form of linkage is needed on the ZR side to analyze data and quantify FX differences.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"linking CM-ROs to original invoices and FX impact"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for splitting revenue between partner and company accounts in OTR implementations, especially for usage and overage revenue?","response":"The best practice for splitting revenue between partner and company accounts in OTR implementations is to set up one commit with multiple usage charges—one for the partner and one for the company. When usage is uploaded, each usage charge automatically takes the GL account from the respective partner or company, ensuring that revenue is split accordingly.

{"instruction":"How should you handle updating or blanking out OTR fields on a Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) when the system returns a 'value is required' error during data backfill?","response":"If you need to exclude certain Product Rate Plan Charges (PRPC) from revenue and update OTR fields to blank but encounter a 'value is required' error during data backfill, you should only include the Charge ID and set the exclude columns (for booking and billing) to true in the backfill upload file. You do not need to provide values for the other OTR fields if you are excluding the PRPC from revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"updating OTR fields on PRPC via data backfill"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for migrating the product catalog and updating revenue accounting fields in an OTR implementation, and what tools or workarounds are available?","response":"Migrating the product catalog in an OTR implementation can be done using the product catalog API loader or Deployment Manager. However, Deployment Manager does not support migrating revenue accounting fields. As a workaround, you can use APIs to update these fields: (1) Set 'Allow Blank Accounting Codes' to Yes, (2) Use the PRPC API to create the charge, (3) Use a separate endpoint to set the revenue fields, and (4) Set 'Allow Blank Accounting Codes' back to No. IPaaS software or workflow templates can automate these updates. Maintaining unique names for rate plan charges is also a best practice to facilitate catalog migration and updates.","category":"best_practice","topic":"product catalog migration and revenue field updates in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How does multi-currency work in OTR and Zuora Revenue, especially in multi-org scenarios?","response":"Multi-currency in OTR allows users to have multiple transaction currencies at the subscription or order line item (OLI) level, rather than at the account level. There is no impact on OTR or Zuora Revenue from enabling multi-currency; the main changes are experienced in Billing. The system supports multiple transaction currencies for each org, and there is no dependency with multi-org. The major experience change is in Billing, not in Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi-currency in OTR and Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommendation for handling invoice line custom field updates after invoice collection in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Once an invoice is collected in Zuora Revenue, updates to custom fields on the invoice line are not allowed. If a custom field value changes after invoice collection, you cannot update the existing billing transaction in revenue. The only workaround is to regenerate the booking and billing transactions with the updated custom fields and collect them to create a new revenue contract, but this may not be possible if the invoice is already collected. No updates are allowed to billing transactions after collection.","category":"procedural","topic":"updating invoice line custom fields after collection"}
{"instruction":"What are the known limitations or considerations when using OTR with Order Harmonization (OH) versus Full Orders?","response":"There are no limitations on OTR itself when used with Order Harmonization (OH); however, K2 has pre-requisite steps before moving to Full Orders. For K2, specific setup steps are required before enabling Full Orders, but OTR does not have such limitations.","category":"comparison","topic":"OTR with OH vs Full Orders"}
{"instruction":"How are invoice adjustments supported in Zuora Revenue, particularly in OTR?","response":"In OTR, only invoice item adjustments are supported in Zuora Revenue. General invoice adjustments (IA) are not supported due to the older technology stack. The adjustment information does not sync between Zuora Billing and Zuora Revenue for general invoice adjustments, so only item-level adjustments are processed.","category":"definitional","topic":"invoice adjustments in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the process and impact of refreshing a Revenue sandbox from Production when switching between K2 and OTR, and what happens to permissions and setups?","response":"When you refresh a Revenue sandbox from Production, the CSBX (sandbox) permissions will match those of Production. If Production is on K2, the sandbox will also reflect K2 setups and permissions after the refresh. If you do not need a particular sandbox (e.g., SND01), you can disable it. Any changes to OTR or K2 enablement should be coordinated between Billing and Revenue, and confirmed after the refresh.","category":"procedural","topic":"refreshing Revenue sandbox and K2/OTR setups"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling revenue accounts not appearing in the product catalog in an OTR-enabled instance, and how can display issues be resolved?","response":"If revenue accounts are not appearing in the product catalog in an OTR-enabled instance, first check if you are connected to a VPN, as this can affect the Billing UI. Disconnecting from the VPN may resolve the display issue. In the meantime, you can use billing data queries to check if the fields are available in the PRPC table and use data backfill to update the fields for testing. If the issue persists, update the Zscaler policy or check with IT, as this has resolved similar issues in the past.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"revenue accounts missing in product catalog OTR"}
{"instruction":"How should you handle missing exchange rates in Billing when transactions are sent to Zuora Revenue, and what are the options for fixing such transactions?","response":"If exchange rates are missing in Billing and transactions are sent to Zuora Revenue without exchange rates, the transactions will error. You can fix these by uploading the missing exchange rates and then regenerating the affected invoices or transactions using the regenerate APIs. Alternatively, you can use a custom revenue accelerator to upload exchange rates directly to Revenue and reprocess the stage table data. Stage validations in Revenue can also be used to block transactions with missing data such as exchange rates.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"handling missing exchange rates in Billing to Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for updating or mapping custom fields at both the RPC and OLI object levels in the OTR Billing template, and are there any limitations?","response":"In the OTR object field mapping, you can use the same attribute (e.g., ATR1) to map custom fields for both RPC and OLI in the Booking template. However, in the Billing template, once an attribute is mapped to the RPC custom field, it cannot be mapped to the OLI object. This limitation means you cannot use the same attribute for both levels in the Billing template, and there is currently no enhancement to support this. You may need to use different attributes for each object level.","category":"definitional","topic":"mapping custom fields in OTR Billing template"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle negative price usage charges in OTR, and are there any known issues or fixes for this scenario?","response":"Negative price usage charges (e.g., for rebates or credits) are a common requirement, but OTR does not fully support this use case. In billing, usage charges with negative per unit prices can be created, but in revenue, usage charges are always defaulted to a sell price of zero, making it difficult to distinguish between positive and negative amounts. This can cause errors, such as a CM-C line being collected without a corresponding invoice line. There has been a fix for some related issues, but the handling of negative price usage charges remains a topic for further internal product discussion. For now, this use case is not fully supported, and customers with this requirement should consult with product management for updates.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"negative price usage charges in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommendation for handling seeded POB templates in Zuora Revenue, and can you enable different cost and VC on these templates?","response":"Seeded POB (Performance Obligation) templates in Zuora Revenue are designed to support central revenue. If you need to enable different cost and VC (Variable Consideration) on a seeded POB template, it is recommended to create a new POB and move forward, rather than modifying the seeded template. This approach allows you to select forecasts and enable different cost and VC without changing the core seeded template.","category":"best_practice","topic":"seeded POB templates in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can you monitor the performance of the OTR connector, and are there any dashboards or utilities available for this purpose?","response":"There is no dedicated utility or dashboard available to monitor the performance of the OTR connector, similar to the health dashboard for the Salesforce CRM connector. The OTR connector is managed by Product and operates in near real time. There are currently no plans or available tools for a performance monitoring dashboard for OTR.","category":"definitional","topic":"monitoring OTR connector performance"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for updating revenue accounting fields via API, and which field corresponds to the 'Right to Bill Flag'?","response":"To update revenue accounting fields via API, use the PRPC API to create or update the product rate plan charge, and use the 'IsUnbilled' field in the API to correspond to the 'Right to Bill Flag'. This allows you to set the appropriate revenue accounting attributes programmatically.","category":"procedural","topic":"updating revenue accounting fields via API"}
{"instruction":"What are the considerations for using multi-currency in multi-org OTR environments, and how does the system behave for data collection and reclassification?","response":"In multi-org OTR environments, multi-currency allows each org to have multiple transaction currencies. The system supports multiple transaction currencies at the subscription or OLI level, and there is no change in how OTR or Zuora Revenue works. Data collection and long-term/short-term reclassification (LT/ST reclass) are not impacted by multi-currency; the main changes are in Billing, not Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi-currency in multi-org OTR environments"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to exclude a product rate plan charge from revenue and update OTR fields to blank, but encounters a 'value is required' error?","response":"If you want to exclude a product rate plan charge from revenue and update OTR fields to blank but receive a 'value is required' error, you should only include the Charge ID and set the exclude columns (for booking and billing) to true in the data backfill upload file. You do not need to provide values for the other OTR fields if you are excluding the charge from revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"excluding PRPC from revenue and handling required value errors"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for handling standalone credit memos and their application to invoices in OTR, and what is the recommended approach if multiple credit memos are created and applied?","response":"In OTR, all manually created credit memos are treated as standalone in Revenue, creating negative standalone SO/INV lines. If multiple credit memos are created and applied to an invoice, and you need to unapply and write off one while applying another, you should purge the invalid credit memo from the stage (if not yet collected) and only collect the valid one. The business reason for the credit memo should be considered, and if the scenario involves moving from prepaid to postpaid, it may be better handled through an order action rather than manual credit memos.","category":"best_practice","topic":"handling standalone credit memos in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What are the limitations and risks associated with terms and conditions changes (decreasing/increasing term) in OTR, especially when billing in advance?","response":"In OTR, when billing in advance, there are limitations with terms and conditions changes such as decreasing and then increasing the term. If a term decrease occurs after a segment is already invoiced, a CM-C (credit memo cancellation) is generated. Upon a subsequent term increase, instead of creating a new segment, billing extends the existing segments, which can result in a CM-C that will never get a CM-RO (credit memo reversal) from upstream. This creates a risk of unmatched credit memos in the system.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"terms and conditions changes in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where usage is uploaded in Billing before unbilled usage is enabled, and what steps can be taken to process already uploaded usage data?","response":"If usage is uploaded in Billing before unbilled usage is enabled, the data will not flow into Revenue. After enabling unbilled usage, you can process already uploaded usage data by deleting the consumption from the prestg table and re-uploading it in Revenue through a custom upload. Running the usage process will then process the data without duplication. Any new usage uploaded in Billing will be automatically handled by OTR going forward.","category":"procedural","topic":"processing usage uploaded before unbilled usage enabled"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for migrating Billing ME (multi-entity) to a single Revenue org, and what are the considerations for removing or deprovisioning entities?","response":"Billing ME to a single Revenue org is supported in both K2 and UNO. There is no need to migrate to UNO unless desired, but all enhancements are being done on UNO. In ME deployments, it is typical to have an empty global entity to hold all real entities. You can swap an entity into the parent location in the hierarchy and discard the global entity if it is no longer needed. If an entity is no longer used, it does not need to be mapped to Revenue. For deprovisioning, ensure you have written permission from the customer, and coordinate with the revenue team for any technical issues.","category":"best_practice","topic":"migrating Billing ME to single Revenue org"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle seeded POB advanced rules in OTR, specifically regarding the use of Name and Line ID for the Derived POB name?","response":"Seeded POB advanced rules in OTR use the condition Name and Line ID for the Derived POB name. This approach is not intuitive for users, but it is the current design. The rationale for this design choice is not detailed, but it is a standard part of the seeded POB configuration.","category":"definitional","topic":"seeded POB advanced rules in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for handling performance metrics and job processing times in Zuora Revenue, and what additional considerations should be taken into account?","response":"Performance metrics for Zuora Revenue, such as processing times for Data Collection, Event Processing, and Transfer Accounting jobs, can vary based on factors like whether the system is standalone, on a dedicated shard, and if there are customizations. It is recommended to consult with Engineering to ensure any assessment is still accurate, as metrics may change over time.","category":"best_practice","topic":"performance metrics and job processing in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the ENABLE_ONE_TIME_CREDIT_BACK profile in OTR, and is it still valid?","response":"The ENABLE_ONE_TIME_CREDIT_BACK profile is not valid once OTR is enabled. In OTR, booking transactions handle the CCV (contractual contract value) for whether credit back is enabled or not, and the profile is no longer used.","category":"definitional","topic":"ENABLE_ONE_TIME_CREDIT_BACK profile in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for allocating discounts to usage charges in OTR, especially when the list price on usage charge defaults to zero?","response":"In OTR, when a subscription has a recurring fee and usage with included units, and a discount is given at the subscription level, the expectation is to allocate the discount across all charges. However, OTR defaults the list price on usage charges to zero, making it challenging to allocate discounts to usage. This limitation means that usage allocation may not work as expected, and alternative approaches or product enhancements may be needed to achieve the desired allocation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"allocating discounts to usage charges in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where exchange rates are missing for transactions in Zuora Revenue, and what are the options for updating or reprocessing these transactions?","response":"If exchange rates are missing for transactions in Zuora Revenue, the transactions will error. You can upload the missing exchange rates and use the regenerate APIs to reprocess the affected transactions.

{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to map the 'relative invoice' field on the credit memo into Revenue for reporting purposes?","response":"Currently, the 'relative invoice' field on the credit memo is not available in the mapping or data source for Revenue. The system allows mapping the billing transaction invoice ID to revenue for the credit memo, but the invoice number is not yet supported for the memo. There is a user story (UNO-3796) to support this enhancement, and it is on the Q2 roadmap as a candidate. For now, the field is not available for reporting in Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"mapping 'relative invoice' field on credit memo to Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to update the POB rev rec timing for rate plan charges, and what is the impact on existing versus new data?","response":"If you want to backfill the POB revenue recognition timing for rate plan charges, changing the PRPC only impacts future new RPC data, not existing data. To update existing data, you need to use data backfill to update the existing RPC and then regenerate the booking transaction. This ensures that the updated rev rec timing is applied to both new and existing data as needed.","category":"procedural","topic":"updating POB rev rec timing for rate plan charges"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to support SFC (Special Financing Charges) within OTR, and what are the limitations?","response":"SFC is supported within OTR, but not completely. Billing schedules need to be manually sent into Zuora Revenue from Zuora Billing to calculate the NPV (Net Present Value). The payment schedule upload is still manual, and it is not automated. Further guidance from the revenue team may be needed for specific implementations.","category":"procedural","topic":"supporting SFC within OTR"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to use consumption revenue with multi-book, and are different points of revenue recognition supported?","response":"Consumption revenue is supported for multi-book scenarios in Zuora Revenue. Both books can have different points of revenue recognition, and the system supports this configuration.","category":"definitional","topic":"consumption revenue with multi-book"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to migrate from K2 to OTR, and what are the considerations for special characters and field values?","response":"When migrating from K2 to OTR, special characters in fields (such as '/') that previously caused issues in K2 should not affect OTR, as OTR uses standard fields with defined value options (e.g., Allocation Eligible can only be null, Y, or N). Custom fields in K2 may have allowed non-standard values, but OTR enforces standardization. It is important to review and clean up any custom field values before migration.","category":"best_practice","topic":"migrating from K2 to OTR and field value considerations"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to use usage charges for a consumption use case, and what is the recommended approach?","response":"For consumption use cases, it is recommended to use the consumption model rather than usage charges. Usage charges are not designed for pure consumption scenarios, and using the consumption model ensures proper handling and reporting in Zuora Revenue.","category":"best_practice","topic":"usage charges vs consumption model"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to update the revenue interface setting for a discount percentage at the subscription level, and what information is needed?","response":"To update the revenue interface setting for a discount percentage at the subscription level, you need to specify the type of discount being used and provide a screenshot of the revenue interface setting. This information helps in troubleshooting and providing accurate guidance.","category":"procedural","topic":"updating revenue interface setting for discount percentage"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to use the AppStore connector for subscriptions, and should these subscriptions be excluded from Revenue?","response":"Subscriptions created via the AppStore connector are typically for reporting purposes only and do not have enough data points for revenue recognition in Zuora Billing or Zuora Revenue. These subscriptions should be marked as excluded from Revenue, and revenue recognition should be performed outside of Zuora Revenue.","category":"best_practice","topic":"AppStore connector subscriptions and revenue exclusion"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to use amount-based events with one-time charges in OTR, and what should be done if errors occur?","response":"Amount-based events are not supported for one-time charges in revenue. If you encounter an error stating 'Amount Based Events is Not Supported only for Recurring charges' when sending one-time charges with amount-based events, it is recommended to seek guidance from the revenue team and post the question in the revenue channel for further assistance.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"amount-based events with one-time charges in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to use prerated usage in OTR, and what is the impact on revenue?","response":"Prerated usage is treated as unbilled usage uploaded to Billing. There is no impact on revenue aside from known issues related to SSP (Standalone Selling Price). If the customer is not using SSP, prerated usage does not cause any issues in revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"prerated usage in OTR and revenue impact"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to use seeded POB templates and enable different cost and VC, and what is the recommended approach if modifications are needed?","response":"If you need to enable different cost and VC on a seeded POB template, it is recommended to create a new POB and proceed with your requirements. Seeded POBs are designed to support central revenue, and making copies or modifications to them is not advised. Creating a new POB allows for customization without affecting the seeded templates.","category":"best_practice","topic":"seeded POB templates and customization"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to use the 'Right to Bill Flag' in the API, and which field should be used?","response":"In the API, the 'Right to Bill Flag' corresponds to the 'IsUnbilled' field. Use this field to set the right to bill status when creating or updating product rate plan charges via API.","category":"procedural","topic":"Right to Bill Flag in API"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to use the workflow template for updating revenue codes, and where can it be found?","response":"There is a standard workflow template for updating revenue codes. You can find it by going to Workflows and then to the standard templates section. This template allows for mass updates of revenue accounting fields.","category":"procedural","topic":"workflow template for updating revenue codes"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to use the 'Split Segment' setting in ZB-ZR integration, and what is the recommendation?","response":"Zuora recommends keeping the 'Split Segment' setting ON in ZB-ZR integration for OTR. This helps avoid risks associated with having the setting OFF, though the specific risks are not detailed. Keeping it ON ensures proper integration behavior.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Split Segment setting in ZB-ZR integration"}
{"instruction":"How does the system handle the scenario where a customer wants to use the 'exclude' flag for surcharges in revenue, and what is its effect?","response":"The 'exclude' flag for surcharges in revenue can be configured to prevent surcharges or their reversals from flowing to revenue. If the flag is not set, both the surcharge and any refund will flow to revenue. If the flag is set, they will be excluded from revenue accounting.","category":"procedural","topic":"exclude flag for surcharges in revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can I exclude standalone Credit and Debit Memos from syncing to Zuora Revenue, and is this possible via the UI or only through API?","response":"Standalone Credit and Debit Memos can be excluded from syncing to Zuora Revenue by using the 'exclude flag' on these memos. This exclusion is available via API only; it is not currently possible to set this exclusion through the UI. Alternatively, you can update the Product Catalog to exclude billing items from Revenue, but this would apply across the board, not just for standalone memos. For explicit exclusion at the memo level, use the API as described.","category":"procedural","topic":"Excluding Credit/Debit Memos from Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for aligning Zuora Billing and Zuora Revenue period close and open processes when OTR is enabled?","response":"The recommended best practice is to keep the period status in sync between Zuora Billing and Zuora Revenue to avoid backdated activities. This means performing the period close in Billing first, followed by Revenue, so that billing periods mirror the revenue accounting periods. This approach helps prevent issues with backdated invoices and ensures that revenue can consume and process them appropriately. This practice aligns with standard industry operations, where upstream periods are closed before downstream ones (e.g., AR before Revenue).","category":"best_practice","topic":"Period Close Alignment for OTR"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to enable both K2 and OTR integrations for the same Zuora Billing tenant when Multi-Entity is enabled?","response":"It is not possible to enable both K2 and OTR integrations for the same Zuora Billing tenant, even if Multi-Entity is enabled. Profiles will change to OTR, and the UNO project in Revenue will be used, making simultaneous operation of both integrations unsupported.","category":"definitional","topic":"K2 and OTR Integration Compatibility"}
{"instruction":"How can I force sync records or monitor sync delays between Zuora Billing and Zuora Revenue in OTR?","response":"To force sync records, you can use the 'Regenerate' API to manually trigger processing of Booking or Billing Transactions. If the transaction does not exist in the DataSource, regeneration will process it and send it to Revenue. If the transaction is already in the DataSource but missing in Revenue, it may be stuck in cross-service processing. For monitoring sync delays, you can check the Booking/BillingTransaction in the DataSource. Delays can occur if the message queue is backed up, as it operates FIFO. There is ongoing work to build a system health dashboard for better monitoring, and auto-scaling of consumers is already in place, though most tenants share queues, which can limit the effectiveness of scaling.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"OTR Sync and Monitoring"}
{"instruction":"What are the considerations and steps for migrating a customer from K2 to OTR, and are there any documents or best practices available?","response":"Migrating a customer from K2 to OTR involves understanding the benefits of OTR, such as support for features like ACB and multi-org, which only work with OTR. There are playbooks and deck templates available for such migrations, and timelines are customer-specific. The process may require special handling for subscriptions with many versions, and data quality is a key factor. If issues arise during migration, tickets should be raised for engineering support. There is no single public document, but internal resources and experience from previous migrations are leveraged. The GS team has transitioned several customers to OTR and can provide artifacts and guidance.","category":"procedural","topic":"K2 to OTR Migration"}
{"instruction":"How does the OTR integration handle owner transfers, and what is the impact on revenue accounting?","response":"When a subscription owner transfer is performed, it triggers a booking transaction that is generated and synced to revenue. However, an invoice owner transfer does not trigger a booking transaction and will not sync to revenue. In recent testing, a subscription owner transfer is processed in Zuora Revenue as a sales order update (version and customer number), but it does not result in revenue accounting changes—it's a silent update.","category":"definitional","topic":"Owner Transfer Handling in OTR"}
{"instruction":"Can I map custom fields with long text to attributes in Booking or Billing templates in OTR?","response":"Currently, mapping a custom field defined as long text to attributes in Booking or Billing templates in OTR is not supported. The system does not support long text fields for this purpose. If possible, use a non-long text field to achieve the required mapping.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom Field Mapping Limitations in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for updating Revenue GL fields on ProductRatePlanCharge via API in OTR?","response":"You can update the Revenue GL fields on ProductRatePlanCharge using the API endpoint for updating RevPro accounting codes. The endpoint allows you to set the revenue fields of the ProductRatePlanCharge directly via API, providing an alternative to the backfill option.","category":"procedural","topic":"Updating Revenue GL Fields via API"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and limitations for handling discounts (fixed amount and percentage) in OTR, especially regarding revenue recognition and mapping?","response":"For fixed-amount discounts, the Billing - Revenue Integration feature only supports billing-based revenue recognition. Booking transactions for fixed-amount discounts must be excluded from revenue accounting, which can be done by setting exclusion flag fields in Zuora Billing. For percentage discounts, OTR treats the discount charge as part of the regular charge, and there is no plan to treat them as individual charges. If a different outcome is needed, use a non-discount charge. The relationship between discount and regular charge can be mapped using the 'discountapplyto' fields in the booking transaction, and this can be joined in billing data queries for reporting or mapping purposes.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Discount Handling in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How does OTR handle the transition from termed to evergreen (EG) subscriptions during renewal, and are there any limitations?","response":"Renewing from termed to evergreen (EG) in OTR is supported and works as expected, provided the POB (Performance Obligation) setup is the same between termed and evergreen. If the POB setup differs, you may need to handle new segments generated for the renewal. There are no specific limitations for this scenario in OTR, but always verify your POB configuration.","category":"definitional","topic":"Termed to Evergreen Renewal in OTR"}
{"instruction":"Is ABP (Advanced Billing Profile) supported in Zuora Revenue for OTR, and what should be considered during transition?","response":"OTR currently supports ABP 1.0 in Zuora Revenue. There is no change in customer experience when using ABP with OTR compared to previous integrations. If a customer is transitioning from K2 to OTR and is using ABP, ensure you verify which version of ABP is in use. The plan should include testing all existing use cases in a sandbox environment before migrating to OTR. The transition is in assessment state for some customers, and OTR is recommended if ABP is required on the revenue side.","category":"definitional","topic":"ABP Support in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How should I handle data migration performance issues during OTR go-live, and what steps can improve migration speed?","response":"Data migration performance can be impacted by features like delivery pricing and the volume of transactions. Disabling delivery pricing permission in the tenant, if not used, can significantly improve migration speed. If migration is slow, check for system issues or exceptions (e.g., related to tax engines), and raise support tickets as needed. Monitoring progress and logs is important, and after disabling unnecessary features, migration should proceed faster. Any remaining issues (such as specific subscriptions with errors) should be regenerated after the main migration completes.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"OTR Data Migration Performance"}
{"instruction":"How does OTR handle negative usage amounts for unbilled usage recognition in Zuora Revenue?","response":"In Zuora Revenue, negative usage amounts for unbilled usage are generally supported if they are adjustments. If there are two different lines—one with a positive rate and one with a negative rate—both should be recognized, and the customer ultimately pays the net amount. However, there may be a stop on the revenue side that prevents recognizing negative revenue on a usage line, so this should be double-checked in your environment. The expectation is that adjustments should work, but if all usage is negative, clarify the use case and test accordingly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Negative Usage Handling in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for handling issues where booking or billing transactions do not sync in OTR, and how can I resolve them?","response":"If booking or billing transactions do not sync in OTR, you can use the regenerate API to manually trigger the sync. This issue has been observed across multiple customers and tenants, and using the regenerate API typically resolves it. If the problem persists or is widespread, raise a support ticket and provide sample subscriptions and tenant IDs for engineering to investigate. Sometimes, the issue is due to system lag or incidents, which are addressed by the engineering team.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"OTR Transaction Sync Issues"}
{"instruction":"How does OTR handle subscription versioning during data migration, especially for subscriptions with many versions?","response":"Handling subscriptions with many versions during OTR data migration depends on data quality. Issues can arise if, over many versions, owner transfers or account deletions have occurred in Billing, causing data issues. If problems are encountered during migration, raise a support ticket for engineering assistance. If all data is out-of-the-box and clean, no specific challenges are anticipated with subscription versioning in OTR.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Subscription Versioning in OTR Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the country name for Sold To and Bill To contacts in Revenue via OTR field mapping?","response":"When mapping SoldToCountryId or BillToCountryId in OTR Manage Revenue Fields Mapping, the field may be labeled as Country ID, but it actually passes the country name. Export the data to confirm the value being passed. No custom lookup in Revenue is required if the field is mapped correctly.","category":"procedural","topic":"Country Name Mapping in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the impact of removing a fixed amount discount (FAD) from a subscription in OTR, and how is the CCV (Contractual Consideration Value) calculated?","response":"When a fixed amount discount (FAD) is removed from a subscription, the CCV for the regular charge remains unchanged, while the FAD charge CCV reflects only the amount that has already been billed. For example, if a regular charge is $50/month and FAD is -$40/month, after removing the FAD, the regular charge CCV stays at the total (e.g., $600 for a year), and the FAD charge CCV is the sum of discounts already billed (e.g., -$160 if four months were billed before removal). The amendment must be set up so that the parent charge remains the same, and the contract modification reflects the correct impact on the parent charge.","category":"definitional","topic":"Fixed Amount Discount Removal in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'Manage OTR Settings' and 'Manage OTR Transactions Regeneration' permissions in Zuora Billing, and which one should I use?","response":"'Manage OTR Settings' controls the OTR settings in Zuora Billing. 'Manage OTR Transactions Regeneration' is a new permission that is still under development and will control the regeneration UI experience in the future. For now, use 'Manage OTR Settings' for OTR configuration, and ignore the regeneration permission until it is fully released and documented.","category":"definitional","topic":"OTR Permissions in Zuora Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can I recognize some products in Zuora Revenue via OTR and others in Zuora Billing via summary journals?","response":"To recognize some products in Zuora Revenue via OTR and others in Zuora Billing via summary journals, use the 'Exclude Item Booking from Revenue' and 'Exclude Item Billing from Revenue' flags on the product rate plan charges you want to exclude from Revenue. However, if these charges are excluded from Revenue and not recognized in Billing either, the revenue is not recognized in either system. Ensure that the correct GL accounts and revenue recognition rules are set up so that excluded charges are recognized in Billing as needed. If issues arise, consult with Zuora Finance PM for setup guidance.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Split Revenue Recognition between OTR and Billing"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for period close sequencing between AR and Revenue, or OM/INV and AR, in the context of OTR?","response":"The industry best practice is to close the upstream period before the downstream period. For example, in the case of AR and Revenue, AR should be closed first, then Revenue. For OM/INV and AR, OM/INV should be closed first, followed by AR. This sequencing helps maintain data integrity and prevents backdated activities from affecting downstream processes.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Period Close Sequencing in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How can I troubleshoot when data is not flowing from Billing to Revenue after a sandbox refresh, even though Booking and Billing Transactions appear in Data Sources?","response":"After a sandbox refresh, if data is not flowing from Billing to Revenue but Booking and Billing Transactions are visible in Data Sources, check if post-refresh updates or configurations are missing. Sometimes, profile settings or configurations need to be updated post-refresh to restore data flow. If the issue persists, create a support ticket and involve Engineering and SRE teams for assistance.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox Refresh Data Flow Issues in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for handling errors when updating revenue fields on product rate plan charges during data backfill, such as permission errors?","response":"If you encounter permission errors when updating revenue fields on product rate plan charges during data backfill (e.g., 'You do not have permission to change the revenue recognition rule on a product'), you need to request the appropriate permission from your administrator. If the issue persists, raise a support ticket for further assistance.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Backfill Permission Errors"}
{"instruction":"How does OTR handle the mapping of discount charges to regular charges, and can I map product class/family/GL custom fields from the regular charge to the discount charge?","response":"OTR treats discount charges as part of the regular charge and does not support treating them as individual charges. The relationship between discount and regular charge can be mapped using the 'discountapplyto' fields in the booking transaction. You can join these fields in billing data queries to map product class, family, or GL custom fields from the regular charge to the discount charge for reporting or mapping purposes. Direct backend mapping is not supported, but data queries can achieve the desired outcome.","category":"procedural","topic":"Discount to Regular Charge Mapping in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What are the considerations for enabling OTR in a live production environment, and is business downtime required?","response":"Enabling OTR in a live production environment should be planned carefully, and coordination with the project lead is recommended for the cutover plan. There may be additional settings to consider, such as proration credit, and it is advisable to use out-of-the-box fields for custom attribute mapping to avoid introducing data architecture changes. While business downtime is not explicitly required, planning and testing are essential to minimize impact.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Enabling OTR in Production"}
{"instruction":"How does OTR handle the recognition of unbilled usage from child accounts when the billing rule 'Include usage from child accounts when Billing' is enabled?","response":"When the billing rule 'Include usage from child accounts when Billing' is enabled, unbilled usage recognition in Revenue may result in recognition events for both child and parent accounts. However, if you process usage in Zuora Revenue to a Consumption (Non-Committed) POB to recognize on usage, you may see usage in consumption history for all charges but no revenue released. In this use case, you must recognize on Billing rather than on usage for revenue to be released. This is a limitation of the current setup.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Unbilled Usage Recognition with Child Accounts"}
{"instruction":"How does OTR handle the mapping of Sold To and Bill To country fields, and do these fields pass the country name or ID?","response":"In OTR Manage Revenue Fields Mapping, the SoldToCountryId and BillToCountryId fields may be labeled as Country ID, but they actually pass the country name. Export the data to confirm the value being passed. No custom lookup in Revenue is required if the field is mapped correctly.","category":"definitional","topic":"Sold To/Bill To Country Mapping in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for handling issues where data migration is slow or stuck, and what steps can be taken to improve performance?","response":"If data migration is slow or stuck, check for features like delivery pricing that may be enabled but not used. Disabling such features can improve migration speed. Monitor logs for exceptions (e.g., tax engine errors), and raise support tickets as needed. After disabling unnecessary features, migration should proceed faster. Any remaining issues, such as specific subscriptions with errors, should be regenerated after the main migration completes.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Improving Data Migration Performance in OTR"}
{"instruction":"How does OTR handle the exclusion of surcharges from revenue, and can surcharges be recognized as revenue if required by the customer?","response":"By default, surcharges are not integrated to Revenue because they are typically not considered revenue items. If a customer wants to recognize a surcharge as one-time revenue, it is possible to capture the POB in Billing and pass it to Revenue, but the standard Zuora Revenue integration does not support this. Custom fields can be added to the surcharge call, but the Revenue Sync (or eOTR process) will not pick it up unless supported in the product roadmap. Surcharges are usually collected to offset fees and do not have a path to revenue recognition in the current setup.","category":"definitional","topic":"Surcharge Revenue Recognition in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for troubleshooting when booking or billing transactions are missing in OTR, and how can I check for variances in ZB-ZR reconciliation?","response":"If booking or billing transactions are missing in OTR, use the regenerate API to manually trigger the sync.

{"instruction":"How can a customer mass update customer names in Zuora Revenue, and what are the best practices or limitations for this process?","response":"Mass updating customer names in Zuora Revenue presents several challenges and limitations. The Mass Actions feature in Labels does not support Customer Name updates, so Mass Action (MMA) is not available for this field. The recommended approach, as per support ticket history, is to use SO (Sales Order) Update. There are three main options: (1) Repush transactions from Workday into Zuora Revenue, which requires updating contracts in Workday or changing the integration to pull all transactions for a given customer; (2) Mass Action, which is not feasible for customer name; and (3) Zuora backend update. The best practice is to use option 1 (repush transactions), as backend updates are generally discouraged. The reason customer name is not enabled for mass actions is that it is used to determine the workbench header for customer information, making mass updates unfeasible. Updates should be based on customer ID, as a company may have multiple contracts, and all contracts for a customer may need updating. If a customer is acquired or changes name, updating by customer ID is logical, but mass action is not supported for this attribute.","category":"procedural","topic":"customer name mass update in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What are the options and considerations for changing the GL outbound file extension from .ZIP to .csv in Zuora Revenue?","response":"To change the GL outbound file extension from .ZIP to .csv in Zuora Revenue, you should adjust the profile option COMPRESS_XFER_REP_FILE_OUTPUT. Disabling this profile should prevent the system from compressing the output file. However, if you are using SFTP to transfer outbound files, you must also ensure that the SFTP configuration is set to not compress the files. If using API for file transfer, disabling the COMPRESS_XFER_REP_FILE_OUTPUT profile alone should suffice. Additionally, the report layout configuration may need to be adjusted to disable compression. Testing is recommended to confirm the changes. If further assistance is needed for SFTP, a TOPS ticket should be raised and relevant documentation attached. Note that if you are seeing .zip files despite disabling the profile, check both the SFTP and report setup configurations.","category":"procedural","topic":"GL outbound file extension change"}
{"instruction":"What is the sequence of processing in Zuora Revenue after data is synced into the system? Specifically, does bundle explosion occur before stage validation, or vice versa?","response":"In Zuora Revenue, after data is synced into the system, bundle explosion occurs first, followed by stage validation on all lines, including the split ones. There is currently no official document specifying this process flow, but this is the established sequence according to internal discussions.","category":"definitional","topic":"processing sequence in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What are the supported and unsupported scenarios for Fixed Amount Discounts (FADs) in Zuora Revenue, particularly for booking-based and billing-based revenue recognition? What considerations should be taken into account?","response":"For Fixed Amount Discounts (FADs) in Zuora Revenue, booking-based revenue recognition may lead to booking–billing variances during prorations. It is important to be aware of these variances when using booking-based recognition. For billing-based revenue recognition, specific considerations should be reviewed based on the customer use case, but no detailed guidance was provided in the discussion. It is recommended to gather information on previous customer use cases to inform the approach, and to be mindful of potential variances and reconciliation needs between booking and billing records.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Fixed Amount Discounts (FADs) in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to have a functional currency change within the same Revenue Contract (RC) in Zuora Revenue, and what are the recommended approaches if a subsidiary's functional currency changes?","response":"It is not possible to have a functional currency change (e.g., from USD to INR) within the same Revenue Contract (RC) in Zuora Revenue. Attempting to do so would impact overall reporting and is not supported. If a subsidiary's functional currency changes, the recommended approach is to either (1) do nothing and let the existing RCs play out, (2) cancel all of the USD RCs and migrate those transactions to the new functional currency, or (3) consider data fixes, though this last option is not recommended due to auditability and complexity concerns. Option 2 is considered ideal, as changing the functional currency mid-contract is not supported and can create significant reporting and technical issues. Data fixes are discouraged due to audit risks and the need for changes in both Oracle and Zuora Revenue.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"functional currency change in Revenue Contract"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and limitations for integrating Salesforce Billing with Zuora Revenue in a standalone scenario, and what fields can be used for integration?","response":"When integrating Salesforce Billing with Zuora Revenue in a standalone scenario, you can use all standard fields available in the stage table, except for revenue-derived fields. It is important to be aware of any limitations or considerations specific to the standalone instance, but generally, standard fields are available for mapping. For more detailed information, consult with the GS (Global Services) team, as they can provide guidance on integration best practices and any exceptions that may apply.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Salesforce Billing integration with Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and lessons learned for data migration from NetSuite to Zuora Billing & Revenue (OTR), specifically regarding whether to migrate all historical contracts or only in-flight contracts?","response":"When migrating data from NetSuite to Zuora Billing & Revenue (OTR), a key decision is whether to migrate a complete snapshot of all historical contracts/subscriptions to retain full transactional history for audit and reporting, or to focus only on in-flight (active) contracts at the time of migration to minimize complexity and streamline post-cutover processing. The choice depends on the organization's audit and reporting requirements versus the desire to reduce migration complexity. Retaining full history supports comprehensive audit and reporting but increases migration effort, while migrating only active contracts simplifies the process but may limit historical analysis. It is recommended to weigh these trade-offs based on business needs and consult with stakeholders to determine the optimal approach.","category":"best_practice","topic":"data migration from NetSuite to Zuora Billing & Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for integrating a professional service app like ServiceNow into Zuora Revenue for events such as percent of completion?","response":"The discussion raised the question of integrating a professional service app like ServiceNow into Zuora Revenue for events such as percent of completion, but no specific integration options or best practices were provided in the available messages.

{"instruction":"What are the options for splitting GL outbound files in Zuora Revenue if the customer is not using connectors, and can TA_BATCH_SIZE be used to limit the number of journal entries per file?","response":"TA_BATCH_SIZE cannot be used to split GL outbound files by number of journal entries per file; it is used to split the TA batch into multiple threads for processing. If the customer is not using connectors, file splitting should ideally be handled in their middleware or GL pre-stage environment. Another option is to use Revenue customization, but this is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary, and any new PLSQL customization deployments require engineering approval, especially as they may not work with Nova. The profile TA_SUB_BATCH_SPLIT_SIZE is only for NetSuite connector scenarios and not for general GL systems.","category":"procedural","topic":"GL outbound file splitting in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for link/delink operations in Zuora Revenue, including any required prep steps and the impact on reporting summarization?","response":"Best practices for link/delink operations in Zuora Revenue include deferring revenue from the POB before delinking and ensuring the Revenue Contract (RC) is unfrozen if it has already been posted. Documentation supports the need to defer revenue before delinking. Unfreezing is also necessary for changes. Reporting summarization does not need to be executed explicitly after link/delink actions, as it is automated internally and updates should be reflected in reports and the Close Process Dashboard (CPD) without manual intervention. However, if issues arise where reports are out of sync after link/delink, it may be necessary to manually trigger summarization.

{"instruction":"What are the options and considerations for updating certain fields (such as amount fields or cancel flag) using the UI in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Updating certain fields such as amount fields or the cancel flag using the UI in Zuora Revenue is generally not allowed or recommended. For example, updating the external sales price on a transaction from upstream should never be allowed, as it may not trigger necessary processes like allocations. Changing the cancel flag from the UI will not trigger the required actions, and similar issues apply to amount fields. The main reason for these restrictions is that such updates may bypass critical processes that are triggered during data collection or SO updates. For fields like product category, there may be more flexibility, but for amount and cancel flag fields, updates should be performed through the appropriate upstream processes or SO updates, not directly in the UI.","category":"procedural","topic":"field updates in Zuora Revenue UI"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and limitations for attribute fields in Zuora Revenue, and is there a way to increase the number of available attribute fields beyond ATR1–ATR60?","response":"Zuora Revenue currently supports up to 60 attribute fields (ATR1–ATR60) on the line. There is no roadmap to extend this limit within the product at this time. If a customer has exhausted all 60 attribute fields, the most common approach is to look for other available fields, such as product category, that may not have been used yet. It is important to ensure that attribute fields are used with clear segregation and consistent mapping logic, as some columns may be misaligned with their intended purpose.

{"instruction":"How can I extract Unbilled Usage values, including overage amounts, for reporting in an external platform?","response":"To extract Unbilled Usage values, including overage amounts, you should use the RatingResult object. The unbilled usage is stored in the RatingResult object, which can be accessed via API (queryRatingResults endpoint) or Action Query (ZOQL). This allows you to retrieve the unbilled usage data for reporting purposes. Note that while you can get the usage charge itself (which will end up on the invoice), you do not get a price per usage unless you use mediation rating, which has its own complexities. For API access, you may need to pass the originalsubscriptionid or the last version subscriptionid depending on the interface. This approach enables you to extract the required unbilled usage information for external reporting.","category":"procedural","topic":"Unbilled Usage Extraction"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for loading usage data directly into Zuora Revenue when it is not entered into the Zuora Billing Usage object?","response":"When usage data is not entered into the Zuora Billing Usage object but needs to be loaded directly into Zuora Revenue, the process typically involves using a workflow that processes a batch file containing the usage data. The workflow is responsible for validating and enriching the data before loading it into Revenue. There is an API that can be used to load this data, and it supports file uploads or processing a batch of records. Additionally, workflows can be configured to handle credentials and error notifications as part of the process. Sharing workflow examples and ensuring credentials are updated before running are recommended best practices.","category":"procedural","topic":"Usage Data Loading into Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can I add a custom field from the account to the 'Revenue details export' report from the accounting periods page?","response":"To add a custom field from the account to the 'Revenue details export' report, you should define the custom field as a segment in the revenue segmentation settings. Once the custom field is added as a segment, it will appear in the 'Revenue details export' available from the Accounting Period page. If this approach does not provide the required data, you may need to use a custom Data Query to pull the information. Testing has shown that adding the field as a segment successfully includes it in the export.","category":"procedural","topic":"Revenue Details Export Custom Field"}

{"instruction":"How can I restrict contact email addresses in a QA environment to only allow a specific domain (e.g., abc.com)?","response":"To restrict contact email addresses in a QA environment to only allow a specific domain (such as abc.com), you can use Custom Logic (CL) with a function that checks the email field. While Decision Table/Tree does not have a 'contains' function, you can write JavaScript to perform the check. The logic should throw an error if the email does not match the required domain, preventing the entry from being saved. The 'check field' and 'throw error' pattern is supported in CL, allowing you to enforce dynamic domain restrictions.","category":"procedural","topic":"Restrict Email Addresses in QA Environment"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to access a Subscription property in custom logic with a target object of Invoice?","response":"It is not possible to access a Subscription property in custom logic when the target object is Invoice, as InvoiceItems are not in scope for such logic.

{"instruction":"Is there a Zuora Billing setting that makes a One Time Charge (OTC) bill again upon renewal if the original version had the OTC?","response":"A one time charge that is billed again upon renewal is considered a recurring charge. To have a charge bill again on renewal, you should use a recurring charge aligned to the renewal terms. The UI may display the OTC from the original quote on a renewal subscription, but this does not mean it will be billed again unless it is configured as a recurring charge. The presence of the OTC in the UI or order preview does not guarantee it will be invoiced on renewal; this may be a UI artifact or due to the original not being included in a bill run.","category":"definitional","topic":"OTC on Renewal Subscription"}

However, both Zuora Reporting and Data Query support Multi-Org, and new reporting and dashboarding capabilities are planned for future releases, starting with new 'Metric' data sources and visual reporting in Q1. In the interim, a workaround is to create a custom field on the Account to track organization and use it for filtering.","category":"definitional","topic":"Multi-Org Support in Analytics Dashboards"}
{"instruction":"How can I add sequential numbers to line items on the HTML Invoice template in Zuora?","response":"To add sequential numbers to line items on the HTML Invoice template, you can use the following expression: {{#Wp_Eval}}{{index}}+1|SetToVar(index){{/Wp_Eval}}. This should be placed within the table structure of your invoice template. Initialize the index variable at the start of the BySubscriptionName loop, and increment it for each line item. This approach allows you to display position numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) for each line item.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Line Item Sequential Numbering"}
{"instruction":"In Zuora CPQ, can a rule be written to add a product based on the total of existing lines on the quote, or is code required?","response":"It is possible to use rules in Zuora CPQ to add a product based on the total of existing lines on the quote. This can be done with a custom rules plugin or declaratively in the UI. For more complex scenarios, a custom action plugin may be required to calculate the total value of lines. Alternatively, a rollup value can be attempted in the UI.","category":"procedural","topic":"CPQ Rule for Product Addition"}

{"instruction":"Why does a charge show as expected in 'view unbilled usage' but turns negative and multiplies by 10 after billing in Zuora?","response":"This issue, where a charge appears as expected in 'view unbilled usage' but turns negative and multiplies by 10 after billing, is a specific billing anomaly. No direct solution is provided, but it is acknowledged as a problem that is causing confusion.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Zuora Billing Issue"}
{"instruction":"If I enable Audit Trail for Credit Memos (CMs) and Invoices in Zuora, are there any storage limits or considerations for the tenant?","response":"There are no storage limits or concerns to worry about when enabling Audit Trail for Credit Memos and Invoices in Zuora, as it is an out-of-the-box feature.","category":"definitional","topic":"Audit Trail for CMs and Invoices"}
{"instruction":"How can I ensure that email notifications are not sent out during a CSBX refresh in Zuora?","response":"During a CSBX refresh, email addresses are scrubbed so that notifications do not go to real addresses. However, even with scrubbed addresses, some customers have reported that their SMTP server is being flooded with outbound requests, affecting other email operations. Muting communication profiles may not be sufficient if the refresh process overrides these settings. There is no definitive solution provided for preventing all outbound email traffic during refresh, especially regarding server load.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"CSBX Refresh Email Notification Issue"}
{"instruction":"Can existing posted invoices from previous accounting periods be consolidated or amalgamated into a single invoice in Zuora?","response":"Zuora's Invoice Grouping feature only supports forward-looking consolidation at invoice-generation time and does not allow merging or consolidating existing posted invoices from previous accounting periods. To achieve a single consolidated invoice for a past period, the recommended approach is to offset or cancel the original invoices (ideally in an open accounting period) and then re-bill that period with configuration that produces a single consolidated invoice. Account Summary Statements can be used to present outstanding balances, but they do not merge invoices.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Consolidation for Past Periods"}
{"instruction":"How can I retrieve usage data in Zuora Workflows that is outside the cleanup period?","response":"Usage data outside the cleanup period can be retrieved using metrics in Cerebro, specifically under Trends -> workflow tasks. Information can also be found in OneId -> Zuora Entitlements. The usage consumption of Workflow is visible in the metrics regardless of whether workflow instances or tasks have been purged.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow Usage Data Retrieval"}
{"instruction":"How can I extract Unbilled Usage values, including overage amounts, for reporting in an external platform?","response":"To extract Unbilled Usage values, including overage amounts, you should use the RatingResult object. The unbilled usage is stored in the RatingResult object, which can be accessed via API (queryRatingResults endpoint) or Action Query (ZOQL). This allows you to retrieve the unbilled usage data for reporting purposes. Note that while you can get the usage charge itself (which will end up on the invoice), you do not get a price per usage unless you use mediation rating, which has its own complexities. For API access, you may need to pass the originalsubscriptionid or the last version subscriptionid depending on the interface. This approach enables you to extract the required unbilled usage information for external reporting.","category":"procedural","topic":"Unbilled Usage Extraction"}
{"instruction":"When the Unbilled Usage feature is enabled in Zuora, how can one see the Unbilled amount in the UI and is there a way to extract this information?","response":"When the Unbilled Usage feature is enabled, you can see the Unbilled amount in the UI on the subscription view at the charge level, where a 'View Unbilled Usage' option is available. To extract this information, you can use the RatingResult object via API or Action Query (ZOQL), as it stores the unbilled usage data. This allows for external reporting and analysis of unbilled usage amounts.","category":"procedural","topic":"Unbilled Usage Feature UI and Extraction"}

{"instruction":"Is it possible to change a legacy custom field from non-indexed to indexed (or vice versa) in Zuora?","response":"It is not possible to directly change a legacy custom field from non-indexed to indexed (or vice versa). The recommended approach is to create a new custom field with the desired indexing, export/import the data, and then swap the API names of the fields. For large tables, multiple export/import cycles and custom logic may be needed to keep fields in sync until the swap. The only exception is for customers on a dedicated shard, where engineering can index the field, but it will still appear as non-indexed in the interface.","category":"procedural","topic":"Legacy Custom Field Indexing"}
{"instruction":"Do Zuora API integration SLA numbers correlate to TP90 standards (90th percentile)?","response":"A customer has inquired about TP90 (90th percentile) standards for API integration SLAs, specifically whether 90% of all user requests or transactions are processed and returned within 300 ms or less.

{"instruction":"What tax engines are typically used by customers in EMEA and/or ANZ if they do not use Z-Tax?","response":"For customers in EMEA and/or ANZ who do not use Z-Tax, Avalara and OneSource are commonly used third-party tax engines. Some customers use Z-Tax for EU/UK jurisdictions to reduce costs, as tax tables are simpler outside the US/CAN. Conditional logic to choose the tax engine based on the sold-to country is popular. For example, Avalara is used for US and Canada, while Z-Tax is used for other countries. Blackline uses Avalara for EU and Japan. Customers with small tax teams may prefer third-party engines for automation and ease of tax remittance.","category":"definitional","topic":"EMEA/ANZ Tax Engine Recommendations"}
{"instruction":"Is there a single API endpoint in Zuora to determine if a subscription is in a grace period (i.e., a new term has started, there is an invoice to be paid, and the payment attempt failed)?","response":"There is no single API endpoint in Zuora to determine if a subscription is in a grace period. The information must be gathered from multiple endpoints. Data Query via API is not suitable for single-object checks due to concurrency limits. The /v1/transactions endpoints are obsolete, and Quickstart API is not evolving. Zuora does not document 'grace period' as a standard concept; it is a customer-specific definition. The recommended approach is to check for invoices with rejected payments related to the subscription, but this requires multiple API calls and is not straightforward due to Zuora's account-centric invoice model. Linking invoices to subscriptions requires drilling down to invoice items. Some assumptions may be made based on implementation specifics, such as one subscription per account or matching invoice and term dates.","category":"procedural","topic":"Subscription Grace Period API Inquiry"}
{"instruction":"What was the cause of the error 'RenewalSetting is required' in a v1/orders API call, and how was it resolved?","response":"The error message 'RenewalSetting is required' in a v1/orders API call was misleading. The actual cause of the error was the presence of the Idempotency-Key parameter in the request header. Removing the Idempotency-Key parameter allowed the call to succeed.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"v1/orders API Error"}
{"instruction":"How can I access OAUTH credentials in Zuora Sandbox if I am unable to access Users under administration?","response":"If you are unable to access the Users table in Zuora Sandbox as an admin (possibly due to slowness), you can try querying the user by ID and using a direct URL to view the user. The workaround is to use the direct URL with the user ID to access the user details.","category":"procedural","topic":"Sandbox User Access"}
{"instruction":"When are OANDA rates populated in Zuora Billing (ZB)?","response":"Zuora Billing pulls OANDA rates usually once a day.

{"instruction":"How can I link CreditMemo TaxationItemID to its related TaxationItemIds in a Zuora workflow?","response":"In a workflow to cancel a subscription, the /v1/orders/{subscriptions->orderActions->cancelSubscription} endpoint generates the Credit Memo. While CreditMemoItems and related InvoiceItems can be obtained in the Query Task, linking CreditMemo TaxationItemID to its related TaxationItemIds is challenging. There is a request for methods to derive a unique key on TaxationItem, such as a combination of Name, Jurisdiction, and Location Code, but no definitive solution is provided.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Credit Memo Taxation Item Linking"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to automate the annual RSA key rotation process for Snowflake integration with Zuora Mediation, and can Zendesk tickets be created automatically via workflow or API?","response":"Automation of the annual RSA key rotation process for Snowflake integration with Zuora Mediation is not supported; the customer must raise a ticket each year. As a workaround, a scheduled workflow can be set up to automatically create a Zendesk ticket for key rotation. It is possible to raise tickets by sending an email to the support email address, and there is interest in knowing if other projects have implemented automatic Zendesk ticket creation via workflows or API calls.","category":"procedural","topic":"Automated Snowflake Key Rotation"}
{"instruction":"How can I address the issue where a Black Friday discount applied to additional licenses mid-term causes MRR reporting to decrease instead of increase in Zuora?","response":"When a discount is applied at the rate plan level to additional licenses added mid-term, the MRR reporting may show a decrease instead of an increase because the discount is applied to the total subscription value. This is a known issue, and suggestions for addressing it are being sought. No definitive solution is provided in the discussion.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Black Friday Discount MRR Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Which customers are doing subsidized billing in Zuora, where a partner or government entity pays part of an end customer's subscription?","response":"Aura may be a customer doing subsidized billing in Zuora, where a partner pays part of an end customer's subscription.

{"instruction":"What is the best way to migrate the product catalog for an OTR implementation, and how can revenue accounting code fields be updated in mass?","response":"The Product Catalog API Loader has limitations and does not support revenue accounting code fields. Deployment Manager may have similar issues. A workaround is to write a query to extract the fields and use Data Loader for updates. For mass updating revenue fields, check under Revenue Settings for Data Backfill options. This approach can be used to update fields like 'Right to Bill Flag' in CSBX.","category":"procedural","topic":"Product Catalog Migration and Revenue Field Update"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the 'Right to Bill Flag' in mass in Zuora?","response":"To mass update the 'Right to Bill Flag' in Zuora, use the Data Backfill option under Revenue Settings. This method allows for bulk updates of revenue-related fields without manual changes to each record.","category":"procedural","topic":"Right to Bill Flag Mass Update"}
{"instruction":"What are the implications of enabling Invoice Item Settlement in Zuora, and what challenges have been encountered?","response":"Enabling Invoice Item Settlement in Zuora can complicate the data model and impact reporting and data extracts, especially those feeding ERP systems. After enabling, some reports may fail and require updates. Journal Runs will use new transaction types, and detailed journal entries for payments will increase in volume. The object model changes with new objects like PaymentApplicationItem, and some existing fields may no longer be populated as before. It is important to review and update integrations and reports that rely on affected objects.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoice Item Settlement Enablement"}
{"instruction":"How can I cancel a draft invoice in Zuora Workflow and regenerate a new invoice with different target dates?","response":"To cancel a draft invoice in Zuora Workflow, you can use the old CRUD API to update the invoice status to 'cancelled' or use the current API PUT /v1/invoices/{invoiceKey}/cancel. After cancelling, you can proceed to regenerate a new invoice with different target dates. The old API is documented in the 'other APIs' section of the developer center, and the current API may not be fully documented but is functional.","category":"procedural","topic":"Cancel Draft Invoice in Workflow"}
{"instruction":"How can I migrate the product catalog between environments in Zuora, and what are the limitations of Deployment Manager and Data Loader?","response":"The official way to sync the product catalog between environments is to use Deployment Manager, but it may not sync all fields (e.g., Minimum Commit charges, Z-Revenue fields) and does not detect changes in charge type with the same name. Data Loader can be used as an alternative by extracting fields via query and mapping them to templates, but exports and imports may not be fully compatible. For ZB, custom queries and workflows can help manage catalog creation and updates. Mass updates for ZR fields may require a separate process. The lack of a fully compatible, user-friendly feature for catalog migration is a known issue.","category":"procedural","topic":"Product Catalog Sync Methods"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the price of a product rate plan charge across multiple currencies using Data Loader in Zuora?","response":"To update the price of a product rate plan charge across multiple currencies using Data Loader, first use a Data Query on the Product Rate Plan Charge Tier object to retrieve the Tier IDs for each currency. Then, upload a template to Data Loader with the Tier ID and new price for each currency. Map the Tier ID and Price fields accordingly. This method works for updating all currency amounts successfully, as the standard 'Update Product Rate Plan Charge' template may not handle non-USD currencies correctly.","category":"procedural","topic":"Product Rate Plan Charge Multi-Currency Update"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to clean up transactional data while retaining configuration data in Zuora Billing Sandboxes?","response":"The recommended approach is to use a cleanup script developed by Zuora, which deletes all accounts except one, provided the customer has licensed Zuora Workflow. This script removes transactional data but does not reset settings or reference data (such as the product catalog). Notification and callout history may not be fully cleared. Soft-deleting all accounts is another option, but some data may remain accessible for a period after deletion.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Cleanup Options in Billing Sandboxes"}
{"instruction":"What is the maximum number of payment gateways that can be configured in a single Zuora tenant, and how does this apply in a multi-org setup?","response":"If there is a limit on the number of payment gateways in a single Zuora tenant, it is high. Some customers have up to 12 active gateways. There is no specific limit mentioned for multi-org setups, but multiple gateways can be configured as needed.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Gateway Limits"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for enabling payment processing from a call center, specifically for taking deposits while an agent is on the phone with a customer in Salesforce?","response":"Some payment gateways, such as Stripe and Adyen, support MOTO (Mail Order Telephone Order) transactions, which are suitable for call center payment processing. IVR (Interactive Voice Response) may also be considered. The best practice is to use a gateway that supports MOTO transactions for secure and compliant payment processing during calls.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Call Center Payment Processing"}

{"instruction":"Is there a way to provide goodwill or benefit to existing active subscribers in Zuora without using a credit memo?","response":"A time-limited discount rate plan (percentage or fixed amount for a set number of billing periods) can be added mid-term to an existing subscription to provide a benefit without using a credit memo. Alternatively, a negative rate plan can be used for a limited duration. Both methods allow for mid-term application and expiration after a specified number of invoices.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Goodwill Discount for Active Subscribers"}
{"instruction":"Can the auto pay flag be enabled on an account via the Hosted Payment Method (HPM) form in Zuora?","response":"It is not possible to set the auto pay flag on the account via the HPM form. This is a product limitation and not a bug. The typical workaround is to use the Zuora API synchronously to set the auto pay flag after payment information is collected. Event Trigger or Workflow can also be used to update the flag. This is considered an enhancement request, and customers may need to manually or bulk update the flag as needed.","category":"procedural","topic":"HPM AutoPay Flag Enhancement"}
{"instruction":"Is there a setting in Zuora to specify that credit memos should be applied before payments, and what is the default order of operation?","response":"For electronic payments, there is an out-of-the-box option to apply credit memos first. For external payments, a workflow is required. By default, payment run applies unapplied credit memos before collecting the difference from credit card payments. However, between unapplied credits and unapplied payments, there is no setting to establish the order of operation; this must be managed via workflow. This is a known limitation, and an AOC may be tracked for future enhancement.","category":"procedural","topic":"Credit Memo Application Order"}
{"instruction":"What are the limitations and gotchas of the Split Invoice feature in Zuora?","response":"The Split Invoice feature in Zuora is limited to splitting by percentage, not by amount, product, or quantity. If a split draft invoice needs to be reversed, all invoices must be canceled and re-split. The feature is older and may not meet all customer requirements. In some cases, Billing Schedules are used as an alternative. A specific gotcha is that if a milestone billing scenario involves invoices in different periods and the subscription is canceled, future-dated invoices may cause errors such as 'The credit memo transaction is not processed as the credit memo amount is more than the available invoice amount.'","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Split Invoice Feature Issues"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora generate journal entries (JEs) for FX gains/losses, or must they be created manually in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Zuora Billing does generate journal entries for FX gains/losses.

Any statements to the contrary in templates should be updated.","category":"definitional","topic":"FX Gains/Loss Journal Entries"}
{"instruction":"Is there a standard step-by-step process or internal guide for migrating from SOAP to REST APIs in Zuora, especially for Order Harmonization and ISH?","response":"There is no set approach for converting Subscribe/Amend (S/A) calls to Orders API calls, as each integration is different and the structure of Orders API is very different from S/A. The recommended approach is to migrate to Order Harmonization first, perform a full regression, and then modernize to Order APIs as desired. For guidance, reference projects like SportsEngine, which involved both Orders and IS migration. The Functional Design Document (FDD) from such projects can highlight key areas to focus on, including integrations with sales systems, callouts, and reporting. The conversion to Orders API was done by third parties with advice from Zuora, and integration details are critical for planning the migration.","category":"best_practice","topic":"SOAP to REST API Migration Guidance"}
{"instruction":"How can I resolve SSL certificate verification issues in Zuora Workflow callout tasks, and what format should the certificate be in?","response":"To resolve SSL certificate verification issues in Workflow callout tasks, you may need to add the provided certificate to a trust store. The certificate should be included in PEM format, with the '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----' and '-----END CERTIFICATE-----' statements. Disabling SSL verification is a short-term fix, but completing the SSL handshake is preferred for security.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Workflow Callout SSL Certificate Issue"}

No issues were found during testing for similar setups.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Accounting Calendar Configuration"}
{"instruction":"What are common anti-patterns or mistakes seen in Zuora subscription and order management?","response":"Common anti-patterns include creating multiple accounts for address or tax purposes (which can now be handled via Flexible Billing Attributes) and creating multiple accounts for currency purposes (now supported with sub-level currencies). These practices are outdated and can be avoided with current Zuora features.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Subscription Lifecycle Anti-patterns"}
{"instruction":"How can I change the API name of an existing custom field in Zuora, and what are the risks?","response":"Changing the API name of an existing custom field can break any integrations that reference that field. While it is technically possible if there are no integrations, it is generally safer to add a new field with the desired name and migrate data if needed. Caution is advised, as this area is not commonly modified and may have unforeseen impacts on queries and system behavior.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Field API Name Change Risks"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to generate a single PDF from multiple PDFs or invoices in Zuora for dunning or summary purposes?","response":"Zuora does not natively support generating a single PDF from multiple PDFs or invoices. This can only be achieved via Workflow by calling an external service or Lambda function. Alternatively, Account Summary Statements can be used to summarize details across invoices, but they generate a new PDF based on data rather than merging existing PDFs. Custom Document task generators or Lambda tasks are other options, but the statement template is the out-of-the-box solution for summary purposes.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice PDF Consolidation"}
{"instruction":"What is the limit to the number of contacts, subscriptions, and rate plan charges (RPCs) on an account in Zuora?","response":"The number of contacts on an account is flexible and can be around 2,000 or more, though performance may degrade with high volumes. The number of subscriptions per account is typically around 12,000, but can be expanded to 100,000-500,000 with special arrangements. There is no hard limit on the number of RPCs, but performance degradation is noticeable after about 20 RPCs. CPQ may have lower limits due to batch sizing and JSON size constraints. The documentation may show outdated limits (e.g., 100 contacts), but the actual limits are higher.","category":"definitional","topic":"Zuora Object Limits"}
{"instruction":"How does Zuora handle proration for annual charges with monthly billing cycles, especially for February?","response":"Zuora prorates annual charges with monthly billing cycles based on the actual number of days in the month, including February. There is a billing rule to force all months to 30 days, but if this is not enabled, the system should prorate February as 28 or 29 days. The proration calculation can be viewed in the invoice UI by hovering over the 'Amount' value if it is underlined.

{"instruction":"What is the process and what are the complications of changing the period start and end date on a customer's calendar in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Changing the period start and end date on a customer's calendar in Zuora Revenue depends on whether the customer is a new implementation or an existing one. For a net new implementation, the process is easier: purge the old calendar and load a new one, and there may be an accelerator available for this. For existing customers, changing the calendar is more complex and requires custom patching, which can have a wide impact and is considered a mini project. In such cases, it is necessary to engage the Global Services (GS) and Center of Excellence (COE) teams to scope and execute the project. Support does not assist with this process; only GS has access to the necessary data changes.","category":"procedural","topic":"Changing period dates on Zuora Revenue calendar"}
{"instruction":"A customer is unsure about the customizations present in their Zuora Revenue implementation after team turnover. What is the recommended approach to identify and document existing customizations?","response":"When a customer is uncertain about the customizations in their Zuora Revenue implementation due to team turnover, the recommended approach is to engage with internal resources who have historical knowledge of the account. If possible, identify individuals who were involved in the original implementation and can review old documentation. The customer should specify which areas they are interested in so that relevant documentation can be located and reviewed. Planning a workshop with knowledgeable team members can help refresh and document the current state of customizations for future reference.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Identifying customizations in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"Why does a cancelled credit line that is not CV eligible still appear in the list of contract modifications and impact allocation treatment in Zuora Revenue?","response":"A cancelled credit line that is not CV eligible may still appear in the list of contract modifications and impact allocation treatment because the system attaches contract modification rules and treatments to the cancelled line, regardless of its CV eligibility. This behavior is intended to indicate the type of contract modification (CMOD) that occurred. Even if the line is not CV eligible, the system may show the CM rule that would apply, such as 'Retro,' but the revenue contract (RC) header will reflect the appropriate status (e.g., 'P') if only the CV=N line is retro. This can sometimes be a result of user error, so it is advisable to review the process and confirm the system's behavior aligns with expectations.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Contract modification treatment for CV not eligible lines"}
{"instruction":"What should be done if Zuora Revenue sandboxes are inaccessible and display a 'site is under maintenance' message?","response":"If Zuora Revenue sandboxes are inaccessible and display a 'site is under maintenance' message, first check with other users or regions to determine if the issue is widespread or localized.

{"instruction":"How should a customer handle a scenario where a usage-based transaction with non-committed revrec shows an unreleased amount in Zuora Revenue that is not traceable in usage tables?","response":"If a usage-based transaction with non-committed revenue recognition shows an unreleased amount in Zuora Revenue that cannot be traced in the usage tables, it is possible that an invoice was generated and collected for an overstated amount. Running the usage master process job may process and release the unreleased amount. Customers should verify the invoice and collection amounts and ensure that all usage data is properly processed through the usage master process to reconcile any discrepancies.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Unreleased usage amounts in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to upload a file to Zuora Revenue using the api/integration/v1/upload/file API by passing a server location instead of a filename in the API body?","response":"The upload/file API in Zuora Revenue requires a filename to be specified, but it is possible to attach a file from the server location where the API call is initiated. The filename must be mentioned in the API body, and the file can be uploaded from the server's local path.","category":"procedural","topic":"File upload API usage in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"When bringing a cancellation from Salesforce into a standalone Zuora Revenue instance, why does setting quantity to 0 and cancel flag to 'Y' with a non-zero Unit Sell Price result in the unit's selling price being reduced to 0 and triggering a contract modification due to price change?","response":"In a standalone Zuora Revenue instance, when a cancellation is brought in from Salesforce with quantity set to 0, cancel flag set to 'Y', and a non-zero Unit Sell Price, the system reduces the unit's selling price to 0 and triggers a contract modification due to a price change. The expectation is for the contract modification to be triggered due to a change in quantity, not price. This behavior may be due to how the system processes cancellations and updates the selling price. It is important to review the integration and mapping logic to ensure that cancellations are handled as intended and to consult with support if the behavior does not align with business requirements.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Cancellation processing in standalone Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer prevent a Manual Journal Entry (MJE) in Zuora Revenue from transferring upstream to Workday if 'GL Transfer = No' is selected but the entry is still included in the transfer batch?","response":"If a Manual Journal Entry (MJE) in Zuora Revenue is created with 'GL Transfer = No' but is still included in the transfer batch to Workday, it is important to determine whether this is a one-off case or a regular scenario. The system may include the MJE in the transfer batch despite the 'GL Transfer = No' selection. Customers should review the configuration and consult with support to identify if there is an alternative mechanism to prevent the entry from being transferred. Understanding the business reason for wanting an MJE that is not sent to the GL can also help in finding an appropriate solution.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Preventing MJE transfer to Workday"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices and lessons learned for data migration from NetSuite to Zuora Billing & Revenue (OTR), specifically regarding whether to migrate all historical contracts or only in-flight contracts?","response":"When migrating data from NetSuite to Zuora Billing & Revenue (OTR), a key decision is whether to migrate a complete snapshot of all historical contracts/subscriptions to retain full transactional history for audit and reporting, or to focus only on in-flight (active) contracts at the time of migration to minimize complexity and streamline post-cutover processing. Best practices include evaluating the audit and reporting requirements, the complexity of historical data, and the impact on post-migration processing. Migrating only in-flight contracts can reduce complexity, but may limit historical reporting. Migrating all historical contracts ensures full data continuity but increases migration effort and risk. Each approach should be carefully considered based on the organization's needs.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data migration strategy from NetSuite to Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can forecast schedules be generated on a dynamic, period-specific percentage basis in Zuora Revenue, and are user-defined schedules supported in OTR?","response":"Forecast schedules can be generated on a dynamic, period-specific percentage basis in Zuora Revenue by using user-defined forecast schedules. These schedules allow for different percentages to be applied to each period, and the schedule can be readjusted as needed. User-defined schedules work for different percentages and have been used in the past. In OTR (Order to Revenue), user-defined schedules for actuals are not supported, but for forecasts, they can still be defined within the Forecast template and are supported in OTR.","category":"procedural","topic":"Dynamic forecast schedules in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to pass custom fields from the Order object in Zuora Billing to Zuora Revenue in the K2 integration, and what are the recommended approaches if not?","response":"In the K2 integration, it is not possible to map custom fields directly from the Order object to Zuora Revenue. The recommended approach is to push the custom field value to the Order Line Item (OLI) level, which is supported. Alternatively, a DA rule can be used to copy the order object value using the order_id, but this is not recommended. Transitioning the customer to use OTR (Order to Revenue) is advised for better support of custom fields. Using DA with DS tables should be avoided.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom field mapping in K2 integration"}
{"instruction":"Can a customer opt out of a quarterly upgrade in Zuora Revenue if the release is not applicable to them?","response":"Customers cannot opt out of a quarterly upgrade in Zuora Revenue unless there are special mitigating circumstances that are explained and approved beforehand.

{"instruction":"How can a customer exclude transactions less than $10,000 from SSP analysis in Zuora Revenue, and what is the correct way to apply such a filter?","response":"To exclude transactions less than $10,000 from SSP analysis in Zuora Revenue, a filter can be added based on the Ext Sell Price field. The field used for filtering must be included in the view. After adding the filter condition, it is important to back out the batch and collect data again, rather than just recompliance, to ensure the filter is applied correctly. This approach allows lines below the threshold to be removed from SSP analysis.","category":"procedural","topic":"Filtering transactions in SSP analysis"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to display notes from the events file at the line level within the Revenue Contract Workbench in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Notes from the events file do not go to the line level in the Revenue Contract Workbench in Zuora Revenue.

{"instruction":"Is it possible to generate a historical waterfall report in Zuora Revenue, and are there any sample scripts or limitations to be aware of?","response":"The historical waterfall report in Zuora Revenue is a view that updates as a snapshot when it is run. It is not possible to go backwards in time to recreate historical waterfalls, as previous deleted snapshots are not persisted. There are sample scripts for RC rollforward, standard waterfall, and insights in Snowflake, but not for historical waterfall. Customers should be aware of this limitation when planning reporting and audit activities.","category":"definitional","topic":"Historical waterfall report limitations"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for changing the period name format in Zuora Revenue, and can it be defined using a profile?","response":"To change the period name format in Zuora Revenue (e.g., from 'Mon-YY' to 'Mon YYYY'), a one-time update using a script to update the calendar table is required. There is no profile available to define the period name format; it must be updated directly in the database.","category":"procedural","topic":"Changing period name format in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer handle a scenario where a 3-year contract billed in Year 1 results in overstated Long Term CL, and how can they get the correct LT number as of prior periods?","response":"If a 3-year contract is billed in Year 1 and results in overstated Long Term CL, enabling the INVOICE_CONTRACT_RATABLE profile will provide an accurate LT/ST CL balance at the end of each period, but only prospectively for newer transactions.

{"instruction":"What is the process for tracking CPD refresh and netting jobs in Zuora Revenue, and can these be monitored via scheduled jobs?","response":"The CPD refresh job is visible in the schedule job list view when run manually, but there is no single job that runs for CPD refresh automatically in the background. CPD is dynamically triggered based on multiple actions, and there is currently no way to track these automatic triggers. The last refresh date and time for CPD is displayed in the top right corner of the CPD page. Netting job tracking was not specifically addressed.","category":"procedural","topic":"Tracking CPD refresh and netting jobs"}
{"instruction":"How should a customer handle POBs in auto POB state due to misconfiguration in Zuora Revenue OTR?","response":"If POBs are in auto POB state due to misconfiguration in Zuora Revenue OTR, the recommended approach is to perform a data backfill on the affected RPCs, regenerate the sales orders (SOs), and run data collection (DC). If the fields are populated correctly in billing but the configuration issue is in Revenue, recollecting the data with the correct mapping should resolve the issue and remove the auto POB state.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Handling auto POB state in OTR"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to handle FX gain/loss in Zuora Revenue, and what is the standard process for recognizing revenue before billing?","response":"Zuora Revenue does not handle FX gain/loss directly. When revenue is recognized before billing, the system uses the sales order (SO) date exchange rate. Upon receiving the invoice, the system reverses the revenue at the SO date and rebooks it at the invoice rate, ensuring that functional Deferred Revenue/CL balances net to $0. Customers who want to know the impact of FX gain/loss can use the Unbilled FX Report.","category":"definitional","topic":"FX gain/loss handling in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the use of the profile that controls whether the contract modification date on the sales order line is used as the start date for recasting contractual revenue in Zuora Revenue?","response":"When this profile is set to Yes, the contract modification date on the sales order line is used as the start date for recasting the remaining contractual revenue. If the contract modification date is null, the start date of the current period is used. Adjustment revenue is recast following the contractual revenue timing after SSP allocation is completed. When set to No, only adjustment revenue is recast, and the contractual revenue waterfall remains unchanged. This profile controls how revenue is recast after contract modifications.","category":"definitional","topic":"Contract modification date profile usage"}
{"instruction":"If a Manual Journal Entry (MJE) is linked to a Revenue Contract (RC) and SO line ID that is on hold, will the hold prevent the MJE from transferring or transacting in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Putting an RC, POB, or line on hold does not automatically block a linked MJE from approval, transfer, or posting. Holds apply only to the revenue schedules on that line, not to MJEs, which follow their own approval and posting workflow. To ensure an MJE waits until the RC hold is cleared, require MJE approval, set GL Transfer = No, or hold off on MJE approval until after the hold is released.","category":"definitional","topic":"MJE behavior with RC/line holds"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer prevent double recognition of revenue when two Usage Master Process jobs are executed simultaneously in Zuora Revenue?","response":"To prevent double recognition of revenue when two Usage Master Process jobs are executed at the same time, the 'Incompatible with All' setting should be enabled for the Usage Master Process in the Background Jobs settings. This setting ensures that only one instance of the job can run at a time. Engineering has provided scripts to make the job self-incompatible, and this will be available as a default setting in a future release. From a product perspective, the system should not double recognize revenue even if the job is run twice, but engineering involvement may be needed to enforce this behavior.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Preventing double recognition in Usage Master Process"}
{"instruction":"Is Advanced Consumption Billing (ACB) available for K2 and standalone setups, or is OTR required?","response":"Advanced Consumption Billing (ACB) only requires Consumption Billing and is available for K2 and standalone setups.

{"instruction":"What is the best practice for including Workday tags in Zuora Billing and mapping them into Zuora Revenue?","response":"The best practice for including Workday tags in Zuora Billing and mapping them into Zuora Revenue is to create custom fields in Billing for the Worktags and map these custom fields to attribute fields (ATRxx) in Revenue. Alternatively, GL segments in Billing can be used, which requires corresponding GL segments in Revenue. Worktags are used for reporting purposes in Workday, and the mapping should be configured accordingly in the GL interface setup.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Workday tag mapping in Zuora Billing and Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer upload a custom file to Zuora Revenue via API, and does the upload perform upserts or truncate the table?","response":"A custom upload file can be uploaded to Zuora Revenue via API by providing the template name as input. The upload process supports only inserts, not upserts or truncation. Each upload is treated as a unique batch, and new data is inserted without affecting existing records. This behavior applies to both manual and API uploads.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom file upload via API in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"Can lines be excluded from LT/ST classification in Zuora Revenue based on an attribute, and how are carves treated in the reclass process?","response":"Lines cannot be excluded from LT/ST classification based on an attribute in Zuora Revenue. The LT/ST classification considers both contractual and adjustment (carve) revenue. Carves are treated as billed, so they are always included in the reclass if they spread past one year. The system does not track carve value by billed vs unbilled, which can lead to reclasses that may not align with billing status.","category":"definitional","topic":"LT/ST classification and carve treatment"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for updating the fiscal calendar in Zuora Revenue, and what are the considerations for revenue deferral and reporting?","response":"When updating the fiscal calendar in Zuora Revenue (e.g., shifting from January–December to February–January), one approach is to have a 13-month year as a transition, then convert to the new calendar for the next 12 months. This approach is easier than having a stub period and helps with year-to-date reporting. If revenue deferral is not required, the transition can start from the new fiscal year. Data fixes and COE involvement are needed, and the impact on revenue deferrals and reporting must be considered. The appropriate solution depends on whether revenue dates change and how reporting is affected.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Fiscal calendar change process and considerations"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for changing the period name format in Zuora Revenue, and can it be defined using a profile?","response":"To change the period name format in Zuora Revenue (e.g., from 'Mon-YY' to 'Mon YYYY'), a one-time update using a script to update the calendar table is required.

{"instruction":"How can I combine the usage of two products for overage purposes in Zuora, so that a customer committing to a total number of units across both products can have their usage aggregated for overage calculation?","response":"To achieve combined usage for overage purposes when a customer commits to a total number of units across two products (with the same price), you can use Prepaid Drawdown (PPDD). The customer would pay upfront, and both usage units of measure (UOMs) for the products can be linked to the same drawdown/prepaid UOM. This setup allows the usage from both products to be aggregated against the same prepaid balance, enabling overage calculation based on the combined usage.","category":"procedural","topic":"usage aggregation for overage"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to migrate in-flight Direct Debit (DD) payments from one system to another, specifically with GoCardless, so that a payment initiated in the legacy system can be completed in Zuora?","response":"Migrating in-flight Direct Debit payments (such as those initiated in a legacy system but not yet cleared) to Zuora, especially with GoCardless, is generally not supported or recommended. The process is complex because the payment clearing process is already underway in the original system, and Zuora is not designed to take over the clearing of a payment that was not initiated within its own environment. There is no standard approach or precedent for this type of migration, and it is considered a highly unusual and risky request.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"in-flight payment migration with GoCardless"}
{"instruction":"How can I support EDI 820 file format for lockbox processing in Zuora, given that it is not supported out-of-the-box?","response":"Zuora does not support the EDI 820 file format for lockbox processing out-of-the-box. However, some users have explored implementing support for EDI 820 using Zuora Workflow (WF). This would require building a custom workflow to parse and process the EDI 820 files according to the customer's requirements. There is no standard template or solution available, so any implementation would be a custom effort.","category":"procedural","topic":"EDI 820 lockbox support"}
{"instruction":"In CPQX, is there a way to trigger a bill run (generate an invoice) when an order is submitted from Salesforce, similar to the runbilling=true option in the order API?","response":"Yes, in CPQX, before sending a quote to Zuora, there is a check/flag called \"Generate Invoice.\" Enabling this flag will trigger the bill run and generate an invoice upon order submission, similar to using runbilling=true in the order API.","category":"procedural","topic":"CPQX bill run trigger"}
{"instruction":"Can a payment run in Zuora process a credit card payment method if the account's default payment method is wire transfer, but a credit card is stored and explicitly provided?","response":"To process a payment using a non-default payment method (such as a stored credit card when the default is wire transfer), you should use the 'create a payment' functionality, where you can explicitly specify the payment method. The standard payment run functionality always uses the default payment method on the account or subscription. However, with the Payment Run API, you can specify the payment method ID (PMId) for each account in the data field, enabling a 'custom' payment run. This allows you to process payments using a specific payment method even if it is not the default. Note that surcharges only apply to payments triggered via payment runs, not to those created outside of payment runs. When using the custom payment run, ensure that the target date is beyond the due date of the invoice for the payment to be processed. If the payment is not created, check the target date, due date, and other relevant fields. Once these are set correctly, the payment should process as expected.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"custom payment run with specific payment method"}

{"instruction":"When is the 'Upcoming Renewal' notification triggered for a monthly termed subscription, and what is the scheduler's frequency for this event in Zuora?","response":"For a monthly termed subscription created in a specific timezone (e.g., CST), the 'Upcoming Renewal' notification (set to trigger 5 days before renewal) is executed by Zuora's scheduler at a default time of 01:00, regardless of the data center. The scheduler checks for upcoming renewals at this default time, not at the exact time the subscription was created.","category":"definitional","topic":"upcoming renewal notification timing"}
{"instruction":"Why don't payments and refunds inherit the sequence set numbering assigned at the subscription level in Zuora's Flexible Billing, and are there any side effects when used with payment profiles?","response":"In Zuora's Flexible Billing, assigning a sequence set at the subscription level ensures that billing documents (like invoices) inherit the numbering of the assigned sequence set. However, payments and refunds do not inherit this numbering. This is because payments are generally linked to the account, not directly to subscriptions, except when using payment profiles. For example, a payment run can pay multiple invoices from different subscriptions on the same account, making it impractical to link payments to a single sequence set. Even with the 'invoice separately' tag, a payment can still cover multiple invoices. The sequence set includes payment and refund prefixes, which can cause confusion, but unless payment profiles are used, payments remain account-level. The documentation should be updated to clarify this behavior. There are no direct side effects when used with payment profiles, but the relationship between sequence sets and payments/refunds remains account-centric unless specifically configured otherwise.","category":"definitional","topic":"sequence set inheritance in flexible billing"}
{"instruction":"How can I configure payment links in Zuora to allow different payment methods based on the payment amount (e.g., allow CC and ACH under $10k, but only ACH over $10k)?","response":"Zuora's payment link feature does not support dynamic logic to change available payment methods based on the payment amount. Each payment link is tied to a single payment form with fixed payment methods. There is no out-of-the-box way to conditionally display payment methods based on the amount being collected. Workarounds may involve creating separate payment forms and links for different payment thresholds, but this is not natively supported.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"payment link payment method restrictions by amount"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer using CPQX send a Hosted Payment Page (HPM) link to their customer after subscription creation to collect payment method information, especially for sales-led customers without website logins?","response":"To collect payment method information after subscription creation for sales-led customers (who do not have website logins), the following approach can be used: 1) CPQX generates a unique link for each customer account that redirects to the client's website using Zuora's HPM page to capture the payment method. 2) This link is stored in a custom field in the Zuora account using Zuora APIs. 3) Zuora can trigger a notification containing this link, enabling customers to provide payment method details. 4) The customer clicks the link, which redirects them to the client website for payment method collection. 5) The client website opens Zuora's HPM. 6) The customer enters payment information and saves it. 7) The payment method details are saved in Zuora.

{"instruction":"Why does the v1/orders?returnIds=true API call with runBilling set to true not return the invoiceId when the invoice owner and subscription owner are different accounts, but does so when they are the same account?","response":"When using the v1/orders?returnIds=true API call with runBilling set to true, the invoiceId is returned if the invoice owner and subscription owner are the same account. However, if they are different accounts, the invoiceId is not returned. This behavior may be due to how the API handles ownership relationships and is likely a limitation or inconsistency in the API's response structure. This issue has been observed by others and may require further investigation or a workaround.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"orders API invoiceId return with different owners"}
{"instruction":"Can Order Line Items (OLIs) in Zuora be billed to a different invoice owner in the same way as subscriptions, to consolidate billing for one-time purchases?","response":"Yes, it is possible to bill OLIs to a different invoice owner, similar to subscriptions. There is an option for Invoice Owner Transfer during OLI creation, which allows for consolidating billing to a main company account even when the purchases are for different employees or entities.","category":"procedural","topic":"OLI invoice owner transfer"}
{"instruction":"How can I convert a dollar amount to a percentage in Zuora's HTML invoice templates?","response":"You can use JavaScript within an HTML box in the invoice template to convert a dollar amount to a percentage. For example, you can add a div element and a script that takes the invoice amount, divides it by 100, and formats it as a percentage. The script would look like this: <script> function intToPercentage(num) { return (num / 100).toLocaleString(undefined, { style: 'percent', minimumFractionDigits: 0, maximumFractionDigits: 0 }); } document.getElementById('percentage').innerHTML=intToPercentage({{Invoice.Amount}}); </script>","category":"procedural","topic":"HTML template percentage conversion"}
{"instruction":"Is it correct that a single-version subscription cannot be activated for customers who already have a versioned subscription live in Zuora?","response":"Yes, a single-version subscription cannot be activated for customers who already have a versioned subscription live. This is a system limitation, and for further clarifications or to explore feasibility, you should reach out to the relevant product manager.","category":"definitional","topic":"single-version vs versioned subscription activation"}
{"instruction":"Why does an advanced bill run filter in Zuora process so many accounts, and how does the filter logic work for accounts, subscriptions, and charges?","response":"In Zuora, the advanced bill run filter processes many accounts because the system filter logic starts with accounts, then moves to subscriptions, and finally to charges. If you do not specify an Account Filter, all accounts with charges to be billed are picked up, and then the system checks your defined subscription condition. If you do not specify both Account and Subscription Filters, all accounts and subscriptions with charges to be billed are picked up, and then the system checks your defined charge condition. This means that to narrow down the processing to a specific account or subscription, you must include the appropriate filters at each level. The system does not allow direct selection of charges while skipping accounts or subscriptions.","category":"definitional","topic":"bill run filter logic"}
{"instruction":"Is there a roadmap item in Zuora's product catalog to allow adding or removing a specific charge from a subscription, instead of having to remove the entire rate plan?","response":"The ability to add specific charges to a rate plan (even one already created) is supported out-of-the-box via the charge subset feature, and it is available through the API. However, removing a specific charge from a rate plan is not clearly documented and may be a limitation.

{"instruction":"What is the limit on the number of versions supported for a subscription in Zuora, and what are the implications of having many versions?","response":"Zuora supports up to 1001 versions (1000 amendments) per subscription. Having a large number of versions can lead to performance degradation, although this is less severe than in the past. For new customers, the Single-Subscription Version feature may be considered to address some issues, but it can only be enabled on a clean, empty tenant before any transaction data exists. If there are existing transactions, the feature cannot be enabled. In some cases, it may be possible to use the feature conditionally, but this is not the standard approach.","category":"definitional","topic":"subscription version limits"}
{"instruction":"How can I consolidate credit memos generated from return orders with multiple OLIs, to avoid operational inefficiencies from multiple credit memos?","response":"Currently, when a return order is created for OLIs, the invoice group number is removed during return order activation. If the original order contains multiple line items with the same invoice group number, a single invoice is generated, but each line item in the return order results in a separate credit memo. This behavior leads to multiple credit memos for large orders, causing operational inefficiencies. Even when setting the Invoice/CM Generation rule to \"Create Credit Memos for net negative totals\" or \"Put all negative charges on a credit memo,\" separate credit memos are still created. There is no standard solution to consolidate these credit memos, and this remains a challenge for customers with large return orders.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"credit memo consolidation for return orders"}
{"instruction":"What are best practices for capturing payment methods as part of the quoting flow in Zuora?","response":"Best practices for capturing payment methods during the quoting flow include integrating payment method collection into the quote process, ensuring secure handling of payment data, and aligning the flow with the customer's sales and onboarding processes. Specific implementation details may vary based on the payment gateway and business requirements.","category":"best_practice","topic":"payment method capture in quoting flow"}
{"instruction":"How can I determine unbilled charges in Zuora, and what queries should I use to identify missed billing and upcoming anticipated billing?","response":"To determine unbilled usage charges, use the RatingResult table with a query such as: select servicestartdate, serviceenddate, amount, quantity, status from ratingresult where status = 'Rated' and subscriptionid = '<subscription_id>'. For prepaid drawdown, the GuidedUsage table can be used to retrieve unbilled usage or remaining drawdown balance. For recurring charges, calculation is required as there is no direct table for unbilled recurring charges.","category":"procedural","topic":"unbilled charges identification"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to generate both a PDF invoice and a PEPPOL XML file within Zuora, without using a third-party integration?","response":"Yes, it is possible to generate both a PDF invoice and a PEPPOL XML file within Zuora. The generation of PDF and XML files are independent processes, and you can send the PDF to customers via Zuora emails while delivering the XML to the PEPPOL network separately. No third-party integration is required for this dual output.","category":"procedural","topic":"PDF and PEPPOL XML invoice generation"}
{"instruction":"Is there an API to retrieve the list of organizations (orgs) configured in a multi-org Zuora platform, similar to the API available for multi-entity?","response":"There is an internal API available to retrieve the list of orgs configured in a multi-org platform, but it is not publicly documented. The API for multi-entity is available, but the equivalent for multi-org is not officially exposed for general use.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi-org API for org list retrieval"}
{"instruction":"How can I trigger a workflow in Zuora when a customer successfully imports an FX Rates file, given that the 2310 - Import Processed event does not support callouts?","response":"Since the 2310 - Import Processed event does not support callouts, you have a few options: 1) Schedule the workflow to run at a fixed time after the FX rates are typically imported. 2) Have the customer trigger the workflow directly via API after the FX Rate import is complete. 3) If the FX rates are loaded via API, ask the customer to add a step to call your workflow after a successful import. 4) Alternatively, if the file is placed on SFTP, a workflow can be set up to pick up the file. There are limitations in the events and notifications system that prevent direct triggering from the FX Rate import event.","category":"procedural","topic":"workflow trigger on FX Rate import"}
{"instruction":"How can I display non-blended tiered pricing (transparent tiered pricing) on a mail merge invoice template (not HTML) in Zuora?","response":"The question of displaying non-blended tiered pricing (i.e., showing the actual tiered rates and calculations) on a mail merge invoice template (not HTML) in Zuora was raised, but no direct solution or method was provided in the discussion. This remains an open challenge for users needing transparent tiered pricing on non-HTML templates.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"non-blended tiered pricing on mail merge template"}
{"instruction":"What should a customer be aware of when migrating to the EU data center in Zuora, beyond updating API URL endpoints and SDK changes?","response":"When migrating to the EU data center, customers should update API URL endpoints and make necessary SDK changes. Additional considerations or potential issues ('gotchas') were not specified in the discussion, and no specific experiences or warnings were shared. Customers are advised to proceed with caution and consult with others who have completed such migrations for further insights.","category":"best_practice","topic":"EU data center migration considerations"}
{"instruction":"How can I handle a use case where a customer wants to bill one line item on the invoice, but internally the line item needs to be broken over multiple products and/or chart of account accounts in Zuora?","response":"To achieve this, you can group charges in the invoice template. While you cannot have multiple line items with unique chart of accounts (COA) as one charge, you can have one product with multiple unique charges, each mapped to a different COA. Displaying these as a single line item on the invoice PDF requires grouping logic in the template. The actual structure depends on whether 'products' refer to Zuora products, rate plans, or rate plan charges. For the scenario where a line item (e.g., 'Broadcast TV') needs to be split internally (e.g., 85% to one COA, 15% to another), configure a rate plan with multiple charges, each with the appropriate COA. Group the charges per rate plan on the invoice PDF for display. This is standard configuration for billing-only customers not using Zuora Revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"invoice line item grouping and COA allocation"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to test provisioning a PayPal Payment Method (with Braintree as the Gateway) via the Zuora UI? Is it possible, or do we need to wait for a Payment Page to redirect to PayPal for a BAID?","response":"Testing the provisioning of a PayPal Payment Method with Braintree as the gateway via the Zuora UI typically requires the use of a Payment Page to redirect to PayPal and obtain a Billing Agreement ID (BAID). Direct provisioning via the UI without this flow is not generally supported.","category":"procedural","topic":"PayPal payment method provisioning with Braintree"}
{"instruction":"How can I report subscription-level metrics (e.g., TCV, ACV) in home currency if the subscription currency is different from the home currency in Zuora?","response":"To report subscription-level metrics like TCV and ACV in the home currency when the subscription is in a different currency, you can use the fxcustomrate table (if exchange rates are loaded via mass updater). In Data Query, multiply the rate in the fxcustomrate table with the TCV or ACV amount on the subscription to convert the values. This approach allows you to generate reports in the desired currency.","category":"procedural","topic":"subscription metrics currency conversion"}
{"instruction":"How can I create a report in Zuora to compare the monthly invoiced (revenue) amounts for an account for the previous year against changes to the account's estimated MRR caused by orders?","response":"To compare monthly invoiced amounts with changes in estimated MRR due to orders, you need to extract both sets of data: 1) Actual invoiced revenue per month (from invoice data) and 2) Net MRR change estimates (from order metrics or subscription changes). There is no out-of-the-box report for this, so you will need to create custom data extracts and potentially combine them outside of Zuora for analysis. Suggestions include using Data Query to pull the relevant data and then graphing or comparing the results externally.","category":"procedural","topic":"MRR vs invoiced revenue reporting"}
{"instruction":"How can I mass load picklist values for a custom field definition in Zuora, instead of entering them one at a time?","response":"You can use the Settings API to redefine custom fields of a Zuora object and load multiple picklist values at once. The process involves: 1) GET /settings/custom-fields/zuora/<object> to retrieve the current schema. 2) Extract the relevant sub-structure from the payload. 3) Add the picklist values as needed. 4) Remove any default values set to \"\" and any fieldIndex entries. 5) PUT /settings/custom-fields/zuora/<object> to update the definition. This approach allows you to efficiently load a large number of picklist values without manual entry.","category":"procedural","topic":"mass loading picklist values for custom fields"}
{"instruction":"How can I validate VAT IDs for EMEA customers in Salesforce before sending accounts to Zuora, and what are the options for format and authenticity validation?","response":"VAT ID validation can be handled in several ways: 1) Some tax providers like Sovos and Vertex offer APIs that can be called upstream (e.g., from Salesforce) to validate VAT ID format and, in some cases, authenticity. 2) If using Z-Tax, you may need to build custom code in Salesforce to validate VAT ID formats for the relevant jurisdictions. 3) Vertex O-Series, for example, can validate the format and, for EU VAT IDs, check authenticity via real-time database checks (like VIES). These validations occur during tax calculation calls (e.g., invoice preview or post), but for pre-validation (before account creation in Zuora), a custom integration to the tax provider's API is required. The Vertex and Sovos APIs can be called from workflow or directly from the customer's portal for pre-validation. The standard Zuora O-Series connector supports validation during invoice processing, but not pre-validation at account creation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"VAT ID validation options"}
{"instruction":"How can I activate currencies on a charge in Zuora, and are there any API limitations for bulk activation?","response":"Currencies are activated at the ProductRatePlan level in Zuora. You can use the API to activate currencies, and recent updates allow for activating more than four currencies at a time (up to 50-100 currencies). This is more efficient than manual activation via the UI. When activating currencies, ensure that the default currency is included in the list for each rate plan.","category":"procedural","topic":"bulk currency activation on product rate plans"}
{"instruction":"How can I price a product with exclusive tax in the US and inclusive tax in the UK/EMEA using a single Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) definition in Zuora?","response":"You can select whether a rate plan charge is tax inclusive or not at the time of order creation by using charge overrides. This allows you to use a single PRPC definition and specify the tax treatment (inclusive or exclusive) per order, depending on the region.","category":"procedural","topic":"tax inclusive/exclusive pricing per region"}
{"instruction":"How can I limit free trials in Zuora so that the same credit card cannot be used to obtain multiple trials with different emails and accounts?","response":"Zuora does not inherently prevent the use of the same credit card on multiple accounts, as compliance requirements prevent querying for matching card numbers across the system. Some gateways provide a fingerprint for cards, which can be used for additional checks, but this is not foolproof. Custom logic or workflow could be implemented to check for duplicate payment method tokens, but this is not a standard feature and may have compliance implications. Stripe, for example, offers fingerprinting, and Zuora stores a unique Payment Method ID per gateway token, which could be used for such checks via API or workflow.","category":"best_practice","topic":"limiting free trials by credit card"}
{"instruction":"How can I manage Zuora configurations as code using Terraform, and is there any support or best practice for this approach?","response":"There is currently no official Terraform provider for Zuora, but there is customer interest in managing Zuora configurations as code using Terraform. Some customers are exploring this approach for CI/CD purposes, but it is not natively supported. Feedback and use cases are being collected to potentially prioritize this capability in the future.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Terraform integration for Zuora configuration as code"}
{"instruction":"How can I compare the objects and fields that are supported in Zuora's Data Query, AQuA, and Data Source Export (DSE), and what determines which objects are available in each?","response":"The availability of objects in Data Query, AQuA, and DSE is determined by customer demand and domain team priorities. There is no single maintained dictionary or list that shows which objects are supported in each export API. Missing objects are typically added when customers request them. Some objects exist only in Data Query, while others are available in AQuA and DSE. The situation is inconsistent, and improvements are planned, but there is no definitive source of truth at this time.","category":"definitional","topic":"object support in data export APIs"}
{"instruction":"How can I retrieve the custom field value set by a Custom Logic function in the response of a Create Subscription API call in Zuora?","response":"Custom Logic functions that update custom fields on subscription creation are executed after the Create Subscription API call completes. As a result, the custom field value set by the function will not be present in the immediate response to the API call. To retrieve the updated value, a second API call is required after the subscription has been created.","category":"definitional","topic":"custom logic field update timing"}
{"instruction":"How can I report on or export Bill Run Document Generation Errors in Zuora?","response":"There is no direct way to export Bill Run Document Generation Errors via Data Query.

{"instruction":"How can I validate the format and authenticity of Tax ID numbers (such as VAT, GST) for customers in various countries using Vertex O-Series?","response":"Vertex O-Series provides built-in capabilities to validate the format and, in some cases, the authenticity of Tax ID numbers for customers in over 65 countries. It integrates with regional and international databases to check VAT/GST identification numbers, validates structural formats according to country-specific rules, and can perform real-time authenticity checks (e.g., VIES for EU VAT IDs). Validation can be triggered within Vertex or from connected systems using APIs. Businesses can configure which customer types or regions require validation, and error handling is provided for non-compliant IDs. The Vertex Validator tool documents supported countries and ID types.","category":"definitional","topic":"Vertex O-Series Tax ID validation"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the accounting codes for a charge when creating a subscription or adding a product to a subscription in Zuora?","response":"The accountReceivableAccountingCode, deferredRevenueAccountingCode, and similar parameters under chargeOverrides in the Orders API documentation can only be used for Standalone invoices. Attempting to use these fields for standard subscription or product addition actions will result in an error. There is no supported way to set these accounting codes during standard order actions; they must be set after creation using the Mass Updater API or manually.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"charge accounting code update limitations"}
{"instruction":"How can I create multiple invoice schedules in bulk with a single API call in Zuora?","response":"It is not possible to create multiple different invoice schedules in bulk with a single API call in Zuora. Each invoice schedule must be created individually.","category":"definitional","topic":"bulk invoice schedule creation"}
{"instruction":"How can I hide or remove the Cancel button from the Subscription page UI in Zuora, and what are the implications?","response":"There is a property control that can hide the Cancel button, but the cancel button generates order actions similar to the Create Order route. Disabling the button may require a support ticket. Alternatively, user roles and permissions can be used to restrict access, so that even if the button is visible, it will fail without the correct permission. The Cancel button always takes today's date for order and trigger dates, and does not allow for past-dated cancellations, unlike the Create Order route. An enhancement to allow entering the order date in the cancel modal is in the backlog but not yet planned.","category":"procedural","topic":"subscription cancel button control"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the Accounts Receivable Accounting Code for Product Rate Plan Charges (PRPC) in Zuora, and is it possible to set this field during creation via API?","response":"The Accounts Receivable Accounting Code for PRPC cannot be set during creation via API. It must be updated after creation using the Mass Updater API. There is no way to set this field upon creation, which is a limitation for customers managing multiple AR codes. Manual or bulk updates are required after the initial creation of charges.","category":"procedural","topic":"PRPC AR accounting code update"}
{"instruction":"How can I activate a subscription status to 'pending activation' in Zuora Billing UI, and what settings are required?","response":"To set a subscription status to 'pending activation,' you must skip a trigger date (such as service activation) when creating the subscription order. The tenant must be configured to require service activation; otherwise, the subscription will be set to active by default. This setting is found in the subscription configuration options.","category":"procedural","topic":"pending activation subscription status"}
{"instruction":"How can I migrate all historical changes (amendments) to subscriptions when migrating to Zuora Billing, so that the subscription history is preserved?","response":"To migrate all historical changes to subscriptions, you can use a single order with multiple order actions (e.g., create, add product, update product), each dated appropriately to reflect the original amendment timeline. This approach allows you to bring in the full version history of a subscription. Templates for this process are available via developer tools, and the order actions must be chronological and dated to match the original amendments.","category":"procedural","topic":"subscription history migration"}
{"instruction":"How can I create a report to compare ordered MRR against actuals in Zuora?","response":"There is no out-of-the-box report to compare ordered MRR against actuals.

Suggestions include using Data Query or custom reporting to pull the necessary data for analysis.","category":"procedural","topic":"ordered MRR vs actuals reporting"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the prepaid charge (reduce pending units/amount) on a subscription with an active invoice schedule in Zuora?","response":"Once an invoice schedule is in execution mode, updates to included charges are restricted. To update the prepaid charge (e.g., reduce pending units/amount), you may need to remove the charge and create a new one, but the new charge would be in a different invoice schedule. There is no straightforward way to amend the prepaid charge within the same invoice schedule.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"prepaid charge amendment with invoice schedule"}
{"instruction":"How can I configure the GL Summary connector in Zuora to include additional custom fields in the file mapping settings after the app has been created?","response":"If you want to use custom fields in the GL Summary connector's file mapping settings, you must create the custom fields before creating the app. There is no way to refresh the available fields in the interface after creation; you may need to delete and recreate the GL interface to recognize new custom fields. For further assistance, file a support ticket.","category":"procedural","topic":"GL Summary connector custom field mapping"}
{"instruction":"How can I handle a scenario where a customer wants to account for sales tax by state, with different accounting codes for each state in Zuora?","response":"To account for sales tax by state with different accounting codes, you need to update the accounting codes on the taxation item level based on the account's state. This can be achieved by creating a workflow that runs after the bill run or when an invoice is generated as draft. The workflow would extract the account state information and update the taxation item's finance information accordingly.","category":"procedural","topic":"state-based sales tax accounting codes"}
{"instruction":"How can I override accounting codes for invoice write-offs using the PUT_WriteOffInvoice API call in Zuora?","response":"To override accounting codes for invoice write-offs, you can use the onAccountAccountingCode field (under items>financeInformation>onAccountAccountingCode) in the PUT_WriteOffInvoice API call. If this field is omitted, the accounting code from the Rate Plan Charge is used. For more advanced write-off scenarios (e.g., using expense or bad debt GL accounts), the Enhanced Write Off permission can be enabled in the tenant, allowing for revenue and non-revenue impacting write-offs without requiring a PUT call.","category":"procedural","topic":"write-off accounting code override"}
{"instruction":"How can I retrieve the most up-to-date Swagger API file for Zuora, and is it tenant-specific?","response":"The Swagger (OpenAPI) file for Zuora can be downloaded from the API Reference. The file is not tenant-specific; it includes all API call data but does not contain custom fields or tenant-specific configurations. Custom fields present in the tenant must be recreated manually, as the Swagger file does not reflect tenant-specific customizations.","category":"definitional","topic":"Swagger API file retrieval and specificity"}
{"instruction":"How can I sync Zuora Products to existing Salesforce products, and what are the limitations?","response":"To sync Zuora Products to existing Salesforce products, you need to update the Zuora IDs into the Salesforce products. This updates the product but does not create Product Rate Plans (PRPs) and Product Rate Plan Charges (PRPCs). The connector may have changed, and the current behavior should be verified. For further assistance, consult the #data-connect channel.","category":"procedural","topic":"Zuora-Salesforce product sync"}
{"instruction":"How can I use advanced merge fields in callout template configuration in Zuora, and what are common pitfalls?","response":"When using advanced merge fields in callout templates, ensure that functions like First require an argument (e.g., First(1)). The structure of the template must match the object hierarchy, and incorrect usage can lead to validation errors. For example, to fetch product information linked with an order, you need to navigate from the order to the relevant subscription and rate plan, but be aware that this may return products from prior orders if not carefully constructed. The correct syntax and object path are crucial for successful template configuration.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"advanced merge fields in callout templates"}
{"instruction":"How can I assign a variable in Zuora email templates for reuse, and what is the correct syntax?","response":"To assign a variable in Zuora email templates, use Cmd_Assign. For example: {{Cmd_Assign(PLName,\"N/A\",True)}} assigns the value 'N/A' to the variable PLName. You can then use {{#Wp_Eval}}\"{{PLName}}\"{{/Wp_Eval}} to reference the variable elsewhere in the template. This allows for dynamic assignment and reuse of values within the template.","category":"procedural","topic":"variable assignment in email templates"}
{"instruction":"How can I use Data Query in Zuora to pull only the first value from a 1:M relationship, and what SQL techniques are recommended?","response":"To pull only the first value from a 1:M relationship in Data Query, use the ROW_NUMBER() window function with PARTITION BY to number the rows per group, then filter for row_number = 1. For example: WITH RankedJoin AS (SELECT ..., ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ...) as rn ...) SELECT ... FROM RankedJoin WHERE rn = 1. Alternatively, array functions like element_at, slice, or subscript operator [] can be used to select the first element from an array result.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Query first value selection"}
{"instruction":"How can customers prevent transactions from certain subscriptions from being sent to Zuora Revenue by OTR, especially for new subscriptions or order actions created after OTR enablement?","response":"Customers can prevent transactions from being sent to Zuora Revenue by using specific exclude fields available in the API. For new subscriptions or order actions created post-OTR enablement, the fields \"excludeItemBillingFromRevenueAccounting\" and \"excludeItemBookingFromRevenueAccounting\" can be used in the API to block transactions at the desired level. This allows for granular control over which transactions are sent to Revenue, beyond just using catch-up bill runs for migrated subscriptions.","category":"procedural","topic":"exclude transactions from revenue in OTR"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling write-off recoveries in Zuora Revenue when a payment is received after an account was previously written off and churned?","response":"The best practice is to apply the payment in Billing, but from a Revenue perspective, both the write-off credit memo and the debit for the payment received after the write-off should be excluded from processing in Revenue to avoid double counting. If the write-off occurred in a previous period and the payment is received later, an adjustment should be booked to correct the revenue, rather than trying to fix the system retroactively. Alternatively, if the customer is willing to accept the impact, they can process the debit memo created for the write-off credit memo, but generally, an adjustment is preferred for accuracy.","category":"best_practice","topic":"write-off recovery in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer regenerate Transfer Accounting outbound files for already closed periods after modifying GL outbound mappings? Is this recommended, and what is the best way to achieve it?","response":"It is possible to regenerate Transfer Accounting outbound files for closed periods after modifying GL outbound mappings. If the batches for the previous periods exist, the customer can simply click the regenerate button on each Transfer Accounting batch after updating the GL Interface mappings. Alternatively, creating an Accounting Detail Report Layout with all fields in the GL Interface Mapping and generating reports for each period is another approach. However, it is important to consider whether the past periods have already been posted to the GL, as regenerating files may have audit or reconciliation implications.","category":"procedural","topic":"regenerating Transfer Accounting outbound files for closed periods"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to refresh a Zuora Revenue sandbox with a backup older than 30 days, and what are the available options for selecting backup dates?","response":"Yes, it is possible to refresh a Zuora Revenue sandbox with a backup older than 30 days. After 40 days, a Weekend (Saturday) backup can be used for up to 60 days, and the last day of the month backup is available for up to 18 months. The refresh process typically uses the latest available backup, but with special requests or commands, these older backups can be selected for sandbox refreshes.","category":"definitional","topic":"Zuora Revenue sandbox refresh backup options"}
{"instruction":"What is the process and best practice for handling upstream changes to credit memos in Zuora Revenue, such as when a credit memo is booked and then changed on a subsequent day?","response":"Zuora Revenue does not accept updates to billing documents like credit memos. The typical and recommended practice is to cancel the original credit memo and rebill, rather than attempting to update the existing billing document. This approach ensures data integrity and aligns with standard ERP practices.","category":"best_practice","topic":"handling credit memo changes in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer report on revenue that will expire or has expired, specifically when using POB templates that expire revenue at the contract end date?","response":"Customers can use the \"POB Released Report\" in Zuora Revenue to report on revenue with an expiry flag or date, as well as to show recognized revenue resulting from expiration. This report provides the necessary information to track both upcoming and already expired revenue based on POB template configurations.","category":"procedural","topic":"reporting on expired revenue in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for correcting data in Zuora Revenue when order dates are incorrect due to upstream workflow issues in Billing?","response":"The best practice is to correct the data in Billing, not in Revenue. Data updates or corrections in Revenue are tedious, especially after amendments begin. The recommended approach is to debook or cancel the subscription upstream as of the start date and create a new subscription with the correct details. Fixing only in Revenue can cause reconciliation issues, so it is important to work with Billing support to update the necessary data points, remove the incorrect lines from stage, and redo the transformation or regeneration process.","category":"best_practice","topic":"correcting order date errors from Billing in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for handling bundle splits in Zuora Revenue when a renewal introduces a new segment and term number? Will the system use the new bundle split or the old one?","response":"When a renewal introduces a new segment with a new term number, the old bundle split should be end-dated. If not, there will be two splits applicable, and the system might randomly apply either. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the old bundle split is properly end-dated to avoid ambiguity and ensure the correct split is used for the new term.","category":"best_practice","topic":"bundle split handling on renewal in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can customers recognize unbilled amounts through event uploads in Zuora Revenue, and what are the requirements for this process?","response":"Customers can recognize unbilled amounts through event uploads as long as the sales order (SO) has value and revenue release is based on the event. For example, if the SO is 20K, the invoice is 12K, and the event upload amount is 15K, the revenue to date should be 15K. The key requirement is that the SO must have value and the event-based release is properly configured.","category":"procedural","topic":"recognizing unbilled revenue via event upload"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling adjustments in upstream invoices for professional services, such as when negative invoice lines are used for phase changes or hour adjustments, and these lines fail to collect in Zuora Revenue?","response":"The best practice is to ensure that the sign of the invoice amount matches the sign of the original sales order (SO) amount. If adjustments are needed, such as moving hours or amounts between phases, it is recommended to cancel and rebill the affected lines rather than using negative invoice lines that do not match the SO. This approach aligns with how Zuora Revenue processes invoice and SO relationships and helps avoid collection failures.","category":"best_practice","topic":"handling invoice adjustments for professional services in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for setting up contract impairment in Zuora Revenue, and do customers typically use new revenue accounts or existing ones for this purpose?","response":"The setup for contract impairment in Zuora Revenue is configurable and depends on customer preference. Customers can choose to report impairment amounts as part of revenue or in a separate account, and this is determined by their specific reporting requirements. There is no single general practice; it is up to the customer to decide whether to use new or existing accounts in both upstream and revenue systems. Documentation on required configurations, such as accounting setup, profile/lookup configurations, and transaction values (especially for selecting the correct impairment type), is requested but not fully detailed in the available discussions.","category":"definitional","topic":"contract impairment setup in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can customers use Secure Share with Zuora Revenue, and is it possible to ingest externally generated files into Secure Share?","response":"Secure Share in Zuora Revenue is designed for customers to build reports or metrics from shared objects, such as Revenue Accounting Summary and RevenueContractRollForward. It is not possible to ingest externally generated files, such as reports from Zuora Revenue, into Secure Share.

{"instruction":"What is the process for reporting on RPO (Remaining Performance Obligation) for publicly traded companies in Zuora Revenue, including total contracted but not recognized revenue, excluding cancelable contracts, and forecasting future recognition?","response":"To report on RPO for publicly traded companies, customers typically want to see: (1) total contracted but not recognized revenue, (2) the amount excluding any cancelable contracts (which can be identified using a custom field), and (3) how much unrecognized revenue is expected to be recognized over the next 12 months. If the customer utilizes Zuora Revenue's forecasting capabilities, these requirements can be met by leveraging standard and custom reporting features, including filtering by custom fields and using forecasting data. These are standard requirements for public companies and can be addressed with the available reporting tools in Zuora Revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"RPO reporting for public companies in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can customers change the period name format in Zuora Revenue, and is it possible to define this using a profile?","response":"To update the period name format (e.g., from 'Mon-YY' to 'Mon YYYY') in Zuora Revenue, a one-time update using a script to modify the calendar table is required. There is no profile available to define the period name format, so manual intervention is necessary before the customer goes live.","category":"procedural","topic":"updating period name format in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for using custom upload files with the Zuora Revenue API, and are uploads treated as upserts or inserts?","response":"Custom upload files can be uploaded to Zuora Revenue via API by providing the template name as input. Currently, all uploads through the UI or API are treated as inserts, not upserts, because each upload is considered a unique batch. The system does not support upserts or table truncation for custom uploads at this time; only new data inserts are supported.","category":"definitional","topic":"custom upload file handling in Zuora Revenue API"}
{"instruction":"How can customers schedule usage sync in Zuora Revenue, and is there a profile option to enable scheduling for usage sync?","response":"Usage sync in Zuora Revenue can be scheduled to run at a specific time (e.g., daily at 3 am PST). If the option to schedule is not visible, it may be due to missing profile options or system configuration. In some cases, usage sync is triggered automatically when data is inserted to stage, especially if files are uploaded or integration is used. For standalone scenarios, scheduling may need to be enabled or configured differently.","category":"procedural","topic":"scheduling usage sync in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling contract modifications and POB (Performance Obligation) templates in Zuora Revenue, especially regarding the use of standard versus custom POBs for consumption use cases?","response":"The recommended best practice is to use standard out-of-the-box consumption POBs for consumption use cases, rather than creating custom POBs. Custom POBs for consumption scenarios are not aligned with the product's design and can impact scalability and maintainability. If different organizations require different recognition methods or expiry rules, these should be addressed within the constraints of the standard POBs and through configuration, not customization.","category":"best_practice","topic":"POB template usage for consumption in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can customers report on manually recognized start/end dates in Zuora Revenue, and which reports or fields should be used?","response":"Manually recognized start/end dates are not shown in the Waterfall report. These dates can be found in event transactions or as part of the RC workbench revenue actions. There is no out-of-the-box report that directly shows manually changed dates in the Waterfall tab, and this would require an enhancement to the reporting functionality. Customers should use event transaction data or RC workbench details for this purpose.","category":"procedural","topic":"reporting on manual revenue recognition dates"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for handling negative invoice lines for adjustments in Zuora Revenue, and what are the best practices to ensure successful processing?","response":"When handling negative invoice lines for adjustments (such as for professional services), it is important to ensure that the sign of the invoice amount matches the sign of the original sales order (SO) amount. If the signs do not match, the invoice line will fail to collect. The best practice is to modify the billing setup to avoid creating credit memos for net negative invoice totals without grouping charges, and to use data augmentation rules to process positive credit memos and negative debit memos as standalone transactions. This approach helps ensure successful processing and avoids errors related to signage mismatches.","category":"best_practice","topic":"processing negative invoice lines for adjustments"}
{"instruction":"How can customers use the Netsuite connector with Zuora Revenue for multibook environments, and are there any examples of customers using this setup?","response":"The Netsuite GL connector in Zuora Revenue supports multibook environments.

{"instruction":"What is the process for updating the filter criteria in the manage inbound feature of Zuora Revenue, and what issues might prevent updates?","response":"If the manage inbound feature does not allow updating the filter criteria, possible issues include entering values with quotes, browser-related problems, or multi-org configurations that prevent selecting the correct organization. Using browser tools can help identify errors. In multi-org environments, the inability to choose the right org for the update may require raising a support ticket for resolution.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"manage inbound filter criteria updates"}
{"instruction":"How can customers recognize revenue for $0 lines in Zuora Revenue, and why might the system mark these as outside the SSP range?","response":"For transactions with $0 sell price, the system should derive the SSP as $0. However, Zuora Revenue may incorrectly mark these lines as 'N' for SSP Within Range, even though they should be 'Y'. In the same revenue contract, lines with non-zero sell price and matching SSP are marked as 'Y'. The expectation is that $0 lines should also be marked as 'Y' for SSP Within Range, and this may require further investigation or a product fix.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"SSP within range for $0 lines in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for using the MJE_RC_LINE_FIELD_MAP lookup in Zuora Revenue, and what are some use cases?","response":"The MJE_RC_LINE_FIELD_MAP lookup is used to map fields for manual journal entries (MJE) at the revenue contract line level.

{"instruction":"What is the process for handling multi-org and multi-book requirements in Zuora Revenue, such as directing data to specific books or organizations?","response":"In multi-org or multi-book scenarios, if the book ID is populated, the data will be pushed to that specific book; if the book ID is blank, the product will push data to all books. However, Zuora charges customers only for primary book volume, so directing volume to secondary books may have financial implications. For cases where different subsidiaries require different data handling (e.g., different currencies), it is recommended to use one book and filter entries based on segment when pushing to the upstream system (e.g., NetSuite).","category":"best_practice","topic":"multi-org and multi-book data handling in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can customers use the 4-4-5 calendar creation script in Zuora Revenue, and is this script available?","response":"A 4-4-5 calendar creation script has been used in the past for Zuora Revenue, and technical users may have access to it. The script can be used to quickly set up a 4-4-5 accounting calendar, but availability may depend on internal resources or historical usage.","category":"procedural","topic":"4-4-5 calendar creation in Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for handling event-based POBs in Zuora Revenue, and how are start/end dates managed in reports like the waterfall?","response":"Event-based POBs allow for different start and end dates to be provided in event loads, but these dates may not be reflected in the waterfall page. The waterfall tab is not designed to show billing-based information, and users should be guided to use the Billed Revenue Waterfall report for such details.

{"instruction":"How can customers use the 'MULTI_CURR_FV_REPORT_LEVEL' profile in Zuora Revenue, and what is its impact on allocation currency?","response":"When the 'MULTI_CURR_FV_REPORT_LEVEL' profile is set to 'Reporting Currency', the allocation currency is always the reporting currency (e.g., USD). Fields such as allocatable extended functional price and extended SSP price are calculated using line-level exchange rates to arrive at the reporting currency amount. Carves and adjustments are also generated in the reporting currency. If all lines in the revenue contract have the same functional currency, allocations are performed in functional currency; otherwise, reporting currency is used.","category":"definitional","topic":"MULTI_CURR_FV_REPORT_LEVEL profile in Zuora Revenue"}

{"instruction":"How can payment failures be sent from Zuora to an external payment retry vendor like Vindicia after a certain number of retries, and is this done in batch or per transaction?","response":"Zuora does not have a built-in interface to automatically send payment failures to external vendors like Vindicia after a set number of retries. How you send payment failures—whether in near real-time or in batch—depends on how you build the integration. For example, you can configure notifications for near real-time sending or use Workflow for batch processing. Some customers extract payment failures after a certain period (e.g., 30 days) and send the details to the third party, but this is a custom process and not an out-of-the-box feature.","category":"procedural","topic":"sending payment failures to external vendors"}

{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for exporting a very high number of records from a custom object in Zuora, given Data Query and API limitations?","response":"To export a very high number of records from a custom object, Data Query (DQ) can be used, but it has pool size and output limitations. The API 'get' can fetch up to 1000 records per page. AQuA is not available for custom objects. The recommended approach is to segment the export into multiple DQ calls to handle large data volumes. This is currently the only possible solution for such use cases.","category":"best_practice","topic":"exporting large custom object datasets"}
{"instruction":"How does the payment retry process work in Zuora, specifically regarding the behavior of retrying payments, and what happens if the payment method changes mid-cycle?","response":"In core Zuora, a given payment is not retried; instead, a new payment is attempted (with a different payment number) as long as it follows the retry rules (i.e., has not exceeded max consecutive failures and is beyond the retry window). If the payment method changes to wire transfer, the cycle continues on the electronic method until exhaustion. In the past, the only way to stop a cycle was to use a specific API to remove the invoice from collections. Manipulating payment method flags mid-cycle is not recommended as it can cause problems, and this scenario should be tested for the latest behavior.","category":"procedural","topic":"payment retry process and method changes"}
{"instruction":"Is there a specific bundle feature in Zuora to create a product bundle with discounted pricing compared to individual products, or what are the options for setting up such a bundle?","response":"A customer wanted to launch a new product bundle (combining three products into a single SKU with discounted pricing).

{"instruction":"Why does a custom field value on a Rate Plan (e.g., 'Type of Charge') appear as 'N/A' in the invoice template, even though it is set correctly in the Product Catalog, and how can this be fixed?","response":"If a custom field value on a Rate Plan appears as 'N/A' in the invoice template, but is set correctly in the Product Catalog, the issue is likely with the template logic rather than the Rate Plan itself. Reviewing and possibly correcting the conditional logic in the invoice template is recommended. If only one Rate Plan is affected, compare its configuration and template logic to those of Rate Plans that display correctly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"custom field value in invoice template"}
{"instruction":"How can an account's unbilled balance for rated usage be captured in near real-time, and are there higher-level events available to reduce workflow executions per account?","response":"Capturing an account's unbilled balance for rated usage in near real-time can be done by adding a custom event to the RatingResult object, but this only provides charge-level granularity and may trigger multiple workflow executions per account. There is no mention of higher-level events that can be leveraged to consolidate processing and reduce workflow churn. Queueing or filtering logic before the workflow runs is not available, so this remains a challenge.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"unbilled balance event notifications"}

{"instruction":"How does usage rollup work with parent and child subscriptions, especially when using Prepayment Drawdown with usages, and how can parent units be drawn down among children?","response":"When usage rollup is enabled and usage is uploaded to a child subscription, the system may bill both the child and the parent subscriptions. The usage is correctly copied to the parent, but the expected behavior is for parent units to be drawn down among children. If this is not happening, review the configuration, especially when using Prepayment Drawdown with usages. The desired behavior is for the parent pool to be shared among children, but the system may not always handle this as expected.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"usage rollup with prepayment drawdown"}

While you can define criteria to apply a hold if the functional currency is, for example, USD, and apply it to a hold type RC, there is no functionality to support applying a hold based on the functional currency amount exceeding a threshold when the transaction currency is different (e.g., all lines in EUR but hold needed if functional currency amount exceeds USD $150k). There is no available workaround for this scenario at this time.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"RC-level hold by functional currency amount"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended way to extract data from Zuora Revenue, and can Workflow be used for this purpose?","response":"Zuora Revenue does not have a native workflow concept like Zuora Billing. To extract data from Zuora Revenue, the recommended approaches are: (1) Use Reporting and Data Query from within the application for internal extraction needs; (2) Use API calls for external data extraction. Some teams have used Zuora Billing (ZB) workflows to extract data from Zuora Revenue, such as generating and sending GL files to downstream systems, but this is a workaround rather than a supported feature. For most use cases, Reporting, Data Query, or API are the supported and recommended methods.","category":"procedural","topic":"data extraction from Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"Is the Account Distribution feature (splitting a GL account into multiple accounts by percentage) still supported in Zuora Revenue, and what are the alternatives?","response":"The Account Distribution feature, which allowed splitting a GL account into multiple accounts by percentage (e.g., split account 41000 into 41005 (40%) and 41010 (60%)), is no longer supported as a standard product feature in Zuora Revenue. While a few customers (such as NCR) may still use the distribution table, it is not recommended due to lack of UI, support, and visibility, and it requires manual maintenance by support or GS. The best practice is to handle such splits upstream or use product bundles if the distribution/volumes can be managed that way. For new customers, it is advised to avoid this approach and manage splits outside of Zuora Revenue.","category":"best_practice","topic":"GL account distribution"}
{"instruction":"How should a customer handle a contract modification scenario where a contract is shortened and the new waterfall should not include revenue in the removed period, but Zuora Revenue still spreads revenue across all periods?","response":"In a standalone Zuora Revenue environment, if a contract is shortened (e.g., from 3 months to 2 months), and a prospective allocation is triggered, the new waterfall may still spread revenue across all original periods, including the removed period. To achieve the desired outcome (no revenue in the removed period), one approach is to use an RORD (Return Order) update, which can adjust the waterfall as expected. However, note that the extended sell price may not update automatically with this method; only the allocatable extended price is updated. This is expected behavior: the extended sell price updates only with SO update or overstatement, not with RORD. Ensure the POB is set up as event-based and revenue is released by POB expiry date for correct behavior.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"contract modification and waterfall adjustment"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora Revenue support 'Suspend & Resume' functionality out of the box for Order to Revenue (OTR) customers?","response":"Zuora Revenue does support 'Suspend & Resume' functionality for OTR customers out of the box.

If you do not have access to production, you may need support team assistance to obtain this information. Additionally, check if any transactions are being processed in Cerebro or if the observed data is from previously scheduled releases (e.g., waterfall scheduled in advance).","category":"procedural","topic":"post-migration revenue processing check"}
{"instruction":"What is the behavior of consolidated POB (Performance Obligation) allocation and revenue timing/waterfall in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Consolidated POBs in Zuora Revenue drive revenue release based on the leading line, with all other lines matching the release percentage and timing. While POB-level allocation calculates the carve at the POB level and pushes it back to the lines, the within SSP (Standalone Selling Price) range flag is still determined at the line level, not at the consolidated POB level. The allocation, waterfall, and related behaviors remain at the line level, even when POB-level allocation is enabled. The system performs initial allocation at the POB level, then redistributes the resultant allocation percentage among the POBs based on the sell price ratio. Customers may expect the within SSP flag to be determined at the POB level, but currently, it is at the line level.","category":"definitional","topic":"consolidated POB allocation and waterfall"}

{"instruction":"What is the best practice for migrating new entities onto Zuora Revenue for a live Billing and Revenue customer, given that Catch Up Bill Runs (CUBR) cannot be used?","response":"For global rollouts, catchup entries on the Revenue side should be flagged via data fix as posted so they are not picked up. The issue with CUBR is that it does not create invoices, so it is not recommended with Zuora Revenue. The best practice is to ensure that any catchup entries are handled as posted and not processed again, and to avoid using CUBR for new entity migrations.","category":"best_practice","topic":"entity migration and CUBR"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer recognize cost based on billing but recognize revenue upfront in Zuora Revenue?","response":"You can get invoice dates on cost lines and release cost as per these dates.

{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling Credit Memo reversals and re-issuance in K2 (ZB-ZR) integration to avoid stage validation errors?","response":"When a Credit Memo is reversed in Zuora Billing, it generates a Debit Memo, which is processed in Zuora Revenue as a standalone document. Upon reissuing the Credit Memo, stage validation errors can occur if the credit memo amount exceeds the available invoice amount. The best practice is to ensure that the reversal and re-issuance process does not result in credit memos exceeding invoice amounts, and to coordinate the process to avoid validation errors. Additional scripts or support may be needed for mass actions involving many POBs.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Credit Memo reversal and re-issuance"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer enable additional options for 'Action On' in Manage Mass Actions in Zuora Revenue?","response":"If the Revenue Tenant is Billing Integrated, only RC level updates are allowed in Manage Mass Actions.

{"instruction":"What is the difference between Central Revenue and Advanced Revenue in Zuora Revenue, and how difficult is it to upgrade from Central to Advanced?","response":"Central Revenue can handle basic contract modifications such as add/remove/cancel, quantity/price changes, and suspend actions for contractual revenue. However, if the customer needs to use SSPs and perform allocations for contract modifications, this is not available in Central Revenue and requires Advanced Revenue. Upgrading from Central to Advanced Revenue is possible, but the effort depends on the specific features and data involved. If the customer does not allocate revenue between POBs and does not use SSP, Central Revenue may suffice. If future needs include allocations, plan for an upgrade to Advanced Revenue.","category":"comparison","topic":"Central vs Advanced Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer check what version of Zuora Revenue their org is on?","response":"Almost all customers are on the same version (e.g., 37.019.01.00).

Best practices involve careful planning of the transition, understanding the impact on POBs and ratable methods, and possibly consulting with experts for large-scale changes. Specific steps for revenue reallocation are not detailed in the available information.","category":"best_practice","topic":"fiscal calendar transition"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer handle a scenario where a customer wants to apply holds at the Sales Order Number level in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Holds can be applied at the RC, POB, or line level. For applying a hold at the Sales Order Number level, use the workbench hamburger menu to apply a line-level hold, then filter for the SO and apply the hold. For standalone revenue customers, manage mass actions can also be used. Criteria only matter when the hold is systematically applied at RC collect; after-the-fact holds can be applied manually.","category":"procedural","topic":"applying holds at Sales Order Number level"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer handle a scenario where the 'Action On' dropdown in Mass Action only shows 'RC' and not 'Transactions' in Zuora Revenue?","response":"If the tenant is billing integrated, only RC level updates are allowed in Mass Action.

{"instruction":"How can a customer handle a scenario where the RC grouping does not reflect expected grouping fields in the UI in Zuora Revenue?","response":"If lines are grouped into the same RC but the UI does not reflect the expected grouping fields (e.g., GRP_BY_VAL), check if the retain_so/grouping template was changed. If it is a time-based grouping, retain_so will not work. The grouping behavior depends on the configuration of grouping templates and profiles.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"RC grouping and UI display"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer handle a scenario where a customer wants to reverse posted adjustment revenue reduced through a CM-R and reallocate with other lines within the same RC?","response":"To achieve prospective allocation with a cutoff date as of a specific period (e.g., end of June), and reallocate posted adjustment revenue, there is no standard way to do this in Zuora Revenue. The system will reallocate based on the current period, and posted revenue from previous periods may not be reallocated automatically. Custom configuration or support may be required for this scenario.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"prospective allocation and adjustment revenue"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer handle a scenario where the Vimeo waterfall report is publishing records for RCs fully posted/recognized in prior periods?","response":"If the waterfall report includes RCs that are fully posted/recognized in prior periods, it may indicate that the RC scanning program is not updating all RCs as expected. Running the scanning program on demand may help, but if the issue persists, raise a support ticket for further investigation by engineering.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"waterfall report and RC scanning"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer handle a scenario where the Zuora Data Transformation job ends in a warning 'You're not authorized to run the job for this entity' in a sandbox?","response":"Check entity mapping versus org and role org.

{"instruction":"How can a customer handle a scenario where the cost is capitalized when an invoice is issued, but 'Cost Additions' is zero in the Cost Cap/Accrual Rollforward Report?","response":"If cost is capitalized upon invoice issuance but 'Cost Additions' is zero in the report, check the cost formula and ensure that the setup is correct. Multiple cost entries may be created due to contract changes, and the correct behavior is that no cost is capitalized if there is no invoice. If a credit memo is created and capitalized cost is reversed, the capitalized cost becomes zero. The cost formula and setup should be reviewed for accuracy.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"cost capitalization and rollforward report"}

{"instruction":"How do you correctly find the CBA (Credit Balance Adjustment) going forward after enabling Invoice Settlement, and what is the recommended approach for handling CBA and bad debt/write-offs in this context?","response":"Once Invoice Settlement (IS) is enabled, the CBA balance is automatically converted into a credit memo as part of the migration process. There is no CBA balance from that point forward. You can choose which product appears in the credit memo, so it's recommended to create a special product to track the origin of the CBA. The same approach applies to bad debt/write-offs: create a dedicated product to ensure the credit memo doesn't get synced with revenue. This allows for clear tracking and separation of these items post-migration.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Settlement and CBA handling"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to use Bill To contact for tax calculation in Zuora Tax and Direct Avalara Integration?","response":"In Zuora Tax, there is a billing rule that allows switching from SoldTo (the default) to BillTo for tax calculation.

The question about Direct Avalara Integration remains open, as no definitive answer was provided in the discussion.","category":"definitional","topic":"Tax calculation contact selection"}
{"instruction":"How can you model an Order Line Item (OLI) use case where the first hardware item is free and the second is paid, without going outside of Zuora, given that OLI does not support tiered pricing?","response":"The discussion raised the challenge of modeling a hardware use case where the first item is free and the second is paid, noting that OLI does not support tiered pricing. No concrete solution was provided in the thread, but the issue was flagged for further attention by tagging relevant team members. The implication is that this scenario may require creative modeling or a workaround, as native tiered pricing is not available for OLIs.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"OLI hardware pricing modeling"}
{"instruction":"What could cause no results to be returned in an HTML template when filtering a custom object by a DateTime field, and what troubleshooting steps can be taken?","response":"If an HTML template returns no results when filtering a custom object by a DateTime field, check whether the custom field is a text field or a timestamp. If it's a timestamp, direct timestamp comparison may not work as expected. Troubleshooting steps include formatting the DateTime values (e.g., converting to GMT) for both fields or comparing to functions like fn_today. If these approaches do not generate output, further investigation into the filter logic and data types is needed.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"HTML template DateTime filtering"}
{"instruction":"How can you cancel one subscription and refund its full amount when two subscriptions are on a single invoice, and what are the limitations?","response":"To cancel one subscription and refund its full amount when both subscriptions are on a single invoice, create a cancellation order from the specific subscription page, effective the subscription start date. Then, run a bill run to generate a credit memo (CM), and refund the CM to the card. However, this cancel and refund process only works if you have separate invoices for the two subscriptions or if Invoice Item Settlement is enabled. If both subscriptions are on the same invoice and Invoice Item Settlement is not enabled, the system will not allow cancellation via the standard cancel button.","category":"procedural","topic":"Subscription cancellation and refund with multi-sub invoices"}
{"instruction":"How can you customize the Line Memo and Class fields in the Summary GL connector for Netsuite, and what are the limitations?","response":"The Line Memo field in the Summary GL connector for Netsuite can be customized using Liquid templating. For example, you can use '{{JournalEntry.Number}} - {{JournalEntryItem.Type}}' to append the journal entry number with the item type. The Class field is more complex and may require additional logic or segmentation to get product information onto an accessible object. This approach may not always be appropriate, and implementing if-else logic in Liquid code may be necessary. The feasibility of customizing the Class field depends on the specific data model and segmentation setup.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Summary GL connector customization for Netsuite"}
{"instruction":"How can you generate a consolidated invoice upon renewal that includes prorated charges for different rates based on a member's age, specifically for a scenario where a discounted rate applies until the 30th birthday and a normal rate applies after?","response":"To generate a consolidated invoice upon renewal that includes prorated charges for different rates based on a member's age (e.g., discounted rate until age 30, normal rate after), store the birthday in a custom field on the Account. One approach is to use a scheduled order or a future-dated order action to handle the rate plan swap on the 30th birthday. However, using a future-dated order action may not be processed at the time of invoice generation, so a scheduled order is suggested. Running a bill run with a future target date may also be attempted, but may not always yield the desired result. The solution may require further configuration or workflow to ensure the correct proration and consolidated invoicing.","category":"procedural","topic":"Prorated renewal invoicing based on age"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to auto-populate a custom field value from the Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) to an identically named custom field on the Subscription Rate Plan Charge (SRPC) without explicit population, and what are the options?","response":"Auto-populating a custom field value from the PRPC to an identically named field on the SRPC is not natively supported without explicit population. The value can be stamped on the SRPC when the order is created, which may require an extra line of code in the order call. If orders are created manually in the UI, automation is limited. Post-processing with Workflow or an external solution can be used to copy or stamp the value. Custom Logic could be a fit for this use case once it supports the sub rate plan/charge objects, but it is best to populate the field during order placement to avoid performance issues.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom field propagation from PRPC to SRPC"}
{"instruction":"How can a subscription with a 39-month term and specific billing intervals be structured when revenue is based on booking, and what are the recommended approaches?","response":"For a subscription with a 39-month term where revenue is based on booking, and specific billing intervals are required, two main approaches were discussed: (1) Using a ramp deal, where the first two intervals are 12 months each and the third is 15 months, solving the problem upfront without future changes; (2) A custom approach involving an amendment after the second billing period to remove and re-add the charge with an updated billing period for the third interval. The ramp approach is preferred as it is more out-of-the-box and does not require customizations. The initial term should remain 39 months to avoid impacting revenue recognition.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Structuring long-term subscriptions with custom billing intervals"}
{"instruction":"What are the steps to transfer data from an API sandbox to a developer sandbox in Zuora, and what support is available?","response":"To transfer data from an API sandbox to a developer sandbox, the recommended approach is to submit a support ticket to Zuora.

Besides moving endpoints, the support team will assist with the migration process.","category":"procedural","topic":"Sandbox data migration process"}
{"instruction":"What issues can arise with Zuora 360 sync to Salesforce when using split_segment_by_charge, and what are the workarounds for displaying all charge segments in Salesforce?","response":"When both Billing and Revenue are enabled and split_segment_by_charge is used, Zuora 360 sync to Salesforce may only display the last segment (of Version 2) rather than all charge segments. This is because Salesforce only shows the last_segment. There is no direct workaround mentioned to display the first segment details in Salesforce; this limitation is inherent to the current sync logic.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Zuora 360 sync and charge segment display in Salesforce"}
{"instruction":"Does the HTML Invoice template in Zuora support multi-lingual content in a single template, or is a separate template required for each language?","response":"The HTML Invoice template in Zuora does not support multi-lingual content within a single template. A separate template is required for each language.","category":"definitional","topic":"HTML Invoice template multilingual support"}
{"instruction":"How can proration credits (from product removal or cancellation) be auto-applied as part of bill run or bill run post in Invoice Settlement, especially when payment runs are not used?","response":"In Invoice Settlement, proration credits can be consolidated with the invoice if configured, resulting in a single document. If there are no positive charges to offset the credits (e.g., customer churns), a credit memo (CM) is generated. If all prior invoices are paid, the CM cannot be auto-applied and must be refunded, which may require manual intervention or a custom workflow. If there are unsettled invoices and a payment gateway integration is used, the 'Auto-apply unapplied credit memos during payment runs' option can be enabled in Payment Run (without 'Process electronic payments') to auto-apply credits, provided a default payment method and AutoPay are enabled. If not using Payment Run or electronic payments, workflow automation may be needed to apply credits.","category":"procedural","topic":"Auto-application of proration credits in Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"What filtering options are available for ad-hoc runs in the Summary GL Interface, and can this support different executions per Journal Run for Multi-Org customers?","response":"In the Summary GL Interface, filtering can be used for ad-hoc runs, allowing separate journal runs for each organization. This filtering can support different executions of the interface app per Journal Run, which is useful for Multi-Org customers. Separate journal runs can be kicked off for each org using these filters.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Summary GL Interface filtering for Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"How can Zuora be integrated with monitoring and alerting solutions like Datadog and Sentry, and what are common integration methods?","response":"Zuora can be integrated with monitoring and alerting solutions like Datadog and Sentry, which are similar to platforms like Splunk. Some customers use data query (DQ) to extract audit trail record changes and updates, although there is no dedicated API for this purpose. For uptime monitoring, customers may use APIs to trigger basic calls to verify Zuora's availability. Integration methods may include using DQ for audit data and API calls for system health checks.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integration with monitoring and alerting solutions"}
{"instruction":"Are there plans to support the Order object (or other objects) in the fieldLookup function with Multi-Attribute Pricing (MAP)?","response":"A customer inquired about plans to support the Order object (or other objects) in the fieldLookup function with MAP.

{"instruction":"What are the Flexible fields in the Vertex Advantage v1 template used for, and when should they be included or removed?","response":"Flexible fields in the Vertex Advantage v1 template allow for the configuration of custom fields in Vertex, similar to custom fields in Zuora. These fields are used to pass additional data required by custom rules in Vertex that are not covered by out-of-the-box fields. If the customer does not have any Flex fields configured in their tax server, these fields can be removed from the template.","category":"definitional","topic":"Vertex Advantage template Flexible fields"}
{"instruction":"How can you split invoices for different charges on the same subscription when a customer wants separate invoices for each charge, and what upcoming features may help?","response":"To split invoices for different charges on the same subscription, you can use Create Bill Run with billRunFilters to specify specific rate plan charges. Alternatively, you can post the initial invoice before amendments are made, or hold off on billing for amendments until the initial invoice is posted. However, these solutions can become complex to maintain. An upcoming feature in Q2 will allow prevention of invoices merging into existing draft invoices, which may address this use case. Progress can be tracked in ticket INV-16242.","category":"procedural","topic":"Splitting invoices for charges on the same subscription"}
{"instruction":"What are the available options for handling hardware booked but invoiced only upon fulfillment, especially when cancellations are allowed before fulfillment?","response":"When hardware is booked but invoicing occurs only upon fulfillment, and cancellations are allowed before fulfillment, one approach is to use onetime charges instead of Order Line Items (OLIs). With onetime charges, the rate plan can be removed before the billing day, which works end-to-end. OLIs present challenges, such as not being able to edit or cancel a booked OLI prior to fulfillment. For hardware returns (RMAs), initiating a return in the booking state may be possible but requires customization and has not been fully tested end-to-end. The complexity of handling hardware in this scenario led some customers to remove hardware from scope and use onetime charges for services instead.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Hardware booking, fulfillment, and cancellation handling"}
{"instruction":"Are there customers leveraging SFDC CPQ and ACB charge models, and what is the complexity of such integrations?","response":"Yes, there are customers leveraging SFDC CPQ and ACB charge models, such as Veradigm. The integration involves using workflow with custom fields in Salesforce. The complexity depends on the number of drawdowns: if there is only one, it is not very complex; if there are multiple, the integration becomes more complex.","category":"comparison","topic":"SFDC CPQ and ACB charge model integration"}
{"instruction":"Are there integrations that allow Zuora to read contracts and create subscriptions from them, and what solutions exist for this use case?","response":"Zuora offers AI Order Form Entry, which can process order forms and create subscriptions.

The solution is designed to automate the extraction and processing of contract data to create subscriptions in Zuora.","category":"procedural","topic":"Contract reading and subscription creation automation"}
{"instruction":"Why might the 'available to credit' amount on invoices become negative after canceling a subscription and running a bill run, and what settings or bugs could be involved?","response":"The 'available to credit' amount on invoices should never go below $0. If it does, this is likely a bug. The issue may be related to how credit memos (CMs) are generated and applied when canceling subscriptions with discounts. The setting 'Include billing engine credits in total available credit' affects whether the available to credit amount changes based on bill run credits for cancellations. If set to 'No,' the available to credit amount does not change; if set to 'Yes,' it should decrease to avoid over-crediting. The bug appears to be related to the system not zeroing out balances correctly, especially when discounts are involved and CMs are applied across multiple invoices.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Negative available to credit on invoices after cancellation"}

{"instruction":"What is the best way to handle a scenario where a customer wants to send invoices 'n' days before the actual invoice generation date, especially for different advance periods per customer?","response":"To send invoices 'n' days before the actual invoice generation date, create recurring scheduled Bill Runs to bill customers in batches based on a custom field that specifies the advance period (X days) for each customer. Set up multiple scheduled Bill Runs with the Target Date set X days in advance. This approach allows grouping customers by their required advance period and automating the process. If the advance period varies, use the custom field to organize customers accordingly. Scheduling a daily recurring Bill Run with the target date set to the desired number of days ahead will align the invoice generation as needed.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Advance invoice generation scheduling"}
{"instruction":"What are the impacts and risks of enabling certain parameters that may cause incompatibility with ASC 606 revenue recognition, especially if Zuora Revenue is not used?","response":"Enabling certain parameters in Zuora may cause incompatibility with ASC 606 revenue recognition, as stated in the Knowledge Center. If the customer is not using Zuora Revenue, the primary concern is the risk of non-compliance with ASC 606 standards. No additional concerns were specified beyond the incompatibility with ASC 606.","category":"definitional","topic":"ASC 606 incompatibility risks with parameter settings"}
{"instruction":"How can you display the price per tier for a tiered charge in an HTML invoice template, showing each tier and its calculated price?","response":"To display the price per tier for a tiered charge in an HTML invoice template, you need to iterate over the tiers and output each tier's range and price. For example, for an invoice with quantity 260, you would show rows for each tier (e.g., 1-50 at $3, 51-200 at $2, 201+ at $1). The template logic should loop through the tiers and display the relevant information for each, rather than just the total quantity and average price per unit.","category":"procedural","topic":"Displaying tiered charge pricing in invoice templates"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for enabling Delivery Pricing in a Zuora tenant, and why might the Knowledge Center documentation be outdated?","response":"Delivery Pricing may already be enabled in your tenant by default, even though the Knowledge Center documentation states that it needs to be self-enabled from Billing Features. If you do not see the option to enable it, check if it is already active. The documentation may need updating to reflect this change.","category":"definitional","topic":"Enabling Delivery Pricing feature"}
{"instruction":"How can you retrieve the current Net MRR from the Subscription level using the Charge Metrics table, and what is a correct query example?","response":"To retrieve the current Net MRR from the Subscription level using the Charge Metrics table, ensure you filter for the latest subscription version, the last segment of the rate plan charge, active status, and charge metrics with an end date greater than or equal to the current date. An example query is: select s.name,sum(cm.mrrnetamount),sum(cm.mrrgrossamount) from subscription s left join chargemetrics cm on s.name = cm.subscriptionname left join rateplancharge rpc on rpc.id = cm.rateplanchargeid where cm.subscriptionname = 'ZD-S02256398' and s.islatestversion = true and rpc.islastsegment = true and s.status = 'Active' and cm.enddate >= current_date GROUP BY s.name","category":"procedural","topic":"Querying current Net MRR from Charge Metrics"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling a scenario where a customer wants to provide a grace period by extending the due date of an invoice, without unposting and updating the invoice date?","response":"The best practice is to handle the grace period directly in the dunning process rather than changing the invoice due date. One approach is to create a custom field (e.g., GracePeriodDueDate) that can be updated as needed. The dunning workflow can then reference this custom field instead of the actual invoice due date. This method avoids unposting and updating the invoice, and allows for flexible grace period management without affecting invoice aging reports or core invoice data.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Grace period management for invoice due dates"}
{"instruction":"How can you test 'My Account' expired credit card functionality in Zuora, given that you cannot set a past expiration date in the UI or API?","response":"To test 'My Account' expired credit card functionality, you can create a payment method with an expiration date set to the current month and then wait until the next month for it to be considered expired. There is no way to set an expiration date in the past via the UI or API, so testing must be scheduled accordingly. Alternatively, if you have historical data with expired cards, you can use those records for testing. There is no hidden setting to bypass this limitation.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Testing expired credit card functionality"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for handling a scenario where a customer wants to clone an existing subscription in Zuora?","response":"There is no native process in Zuora to clone an existing subscription. Cloning is typically handled by a customer-built integration or process, such as triggering the process outside of Zuora and orchestrating it externally, or by using Workflow. For one-off cases, a workflow can be triggered via a button in the UI. The need for cloning should be evaluated to determine if it is a one-off, for testing, or a common process, as it may indicate an opportunity to optimize the process or design flow.","category":"procedural","topic":"Cloning subscriptions in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can you report on the list of inbound callouts (APIs sent to Zuora) in Zuora?","response":"To report on inbound callouts (APIs sent to Zuora), use the System Health API dashboard. This dashboard logs every API call that hits the system, including those from external systems. It provides visibility into inbound API activity.","category":"procedural","topic":"Reporting on inbound API callouts"}
{"instruction":"How can you export the Countries, Regions, and States configuration from Zuora?","response":"Countries and regions can be exported from Zuora using Data Query with 'SELECT * FROM Country' and 'SELECT * FROM State'. Alternatively, the Settings API can be used: 'GET /settings/regions' for countries and 'GET /settings/regions/{regionId}/sub-regions' for sub-regions (states or provinces).","category":"procedural","topic":"Exporting country and region configuration"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to dynamically populate a custom field with the value of another field in Zuora, and what are the options for different objects?","response":"Dynamically populating a custom field with the value of another field can be achieved using custom logic functions for supported objects (e.g., payments). For objects not supported by custom logic (e.g., Journal Entry), workflow or other integration methods may be required. The feasibility depends on the object type and available automation features.","category":"procedural","topic":"Dynamic custom field population"}
{"instruction":"Can invoice settlement be enabled in only one entity in a multi-entity environment in Zuora?","response":"Yes, invoice settlement can be enabled in only one entity within a multi-entity environment in Zuora.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice settlement in multi-entity environments"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for managing entity segments in Zuora, and should entity be tracked at the account or subscription level?","response":"The best practice is to manage entity segments at the account level in Zuora. Tracking entity at the subscription level is discouraged, as it complicates enforcement of transaction integrity and can lead to untagged transactions. Managing entity at the account level ensures consistency across all transactions (credit memos, invoices, payments, etc.) and simplifies reporting and reconciliation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Entity segment management in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can you retrieve the current roles assigned to a user in Zuora, and what are the limitations of using audit logs for this purpose?","response":"To retrieve the current roles assigned to a user in Zuora, use the UI export mechanism to export current assigned roles. Audit logs (auditsettingchangeeventlog) can show role changes (additions and removals), but may not provide a complete picture if the user was created before audit logging was enabled or if records have been purged. The most recent audit entries can indicate current roles if within the retention period, but there is no API in billing to retrieve assigned roles directly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Retrieving current user roles in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can you handle a scenario where a customer wants to set a maximum number of renewals for a product, such as a student product that can only renew four times?","response":"There is no out-of-the-box way to limit the number of renewals for a product in Zuora. Renewals are subscription-related events, not product-related. Possible approaches include: (1) Using workflow automation to track the number of renewals by maintaining a counter on the subscription and triggering actions (e.g., cancellation or product change) when the limit is reached; (2) Setting the charge end date to prevent billing past the allowed number of renewals, though the subscription itself could still renew. The solution depends on business requirements and may require custom logic or workflow.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Limiting product renewals in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can you display the invoice number in a payment notification email template in Zuora, given the data model's flexibility?","response":"There is no direct 1:1 relationship between Payments and Invoices in Zuora, as a payment can cover multiple invoices and vice versa. To display the invoice number in a payment notification email, use advanced merge fields to access the PaymentApplication object linked to the Payment. For example: '{{#Payment.PaymentApplications|First(1)}}{{Invoice.InvoiceNumber}}{{/Payment.PaymentApplications|First(1)}}' will display the invoice number of the first invoice paid by the payment. This approach may not work for rejected payments and should be tested for the specific use case.","category":"procedural","topic":"Displaying invoice number in payment notification emails"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for changing a tenant name in Zuora, and what parts can be changed by the customer versus requiring support?","response":"Customers can change the display name (banner name) shown at the top of the UI themselves in tenant profile settings. However, changing the actual tenant name (as shown in OneID or system-level references) requires submitting a support ticket to Zuora or contacting the provisioning team.","category":"procedural","topic":"Changing tenant name in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"How can you separate workflow (WF) data by organization (org) in a multi-org environment in Zuora?","response":"To separate workflow data by org in a multi-org environment, execute the workflow from a specific org unit using the org selector, which ensures the workflow runs in the context of that org (all APIs and data access are scoped accordingly). When executing a workflow via API (near real-time WF), you can pass the org id header to run the workflow in the desired org context. Not all tasks may be fully enabled for org separation, so testing is recommended.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow data separation in multi-org environments"}
{"instruction":"How can you report on the size of files generated by workflows or the size of invoice/credit memo PDFs stored in Zuora?","response":"There is no direct method to report on the size of files generated by workflows or the size of invoice/credit memo PDFs stored in Zuora. Attempting to use the datasize field in workflow_task and workflow tables may not yield the expected results. This need may require custom analysis or external tracking, as no built-in reporting exists for file sizes.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Reporting on workflow and document file sizes"}
{"instruction":"How can you relate charges in invoice items to charges in order items created in Orders, especially for interfaces to shopping portals?","response":"There is no direct link between invoice items and order items in Zuora. One approach is to use the invoice item name to match to the subscription rate plan charge name, or to tie each invoice to a specific subscription using the subscription number. Using 'invoice separately' can help ensure unique subscriptions and easier linking between orders and invoices. However, the lack of direct IDs in orderItems may limit the ability to create a precise mapping. Showing the subscription number on the invoice may be sufficient for most account management and customer-facing use cases.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Relating invoice items to order items in Zuora"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for handling a scenario where a customer wants to apply a fixed discount per unit in Zuora's product catalog?","response":"Zuora's product catalog does not natively support fixed discounts per unit for per-unit pricing models. Customers must calculate the quantity themselves and apply the correct discount amount, or use a percentage-based discount and adjust the percentage to approximate the desired fixed amount. This limitation is recognized as a valid use case that is not currently supported out-of-the-box.","category":"definitional","topic":"Fixed per-unit discounts in product catalog"}
{"instruction":"How can you track changes to the Bill Cycle Day (BCD) for an account in Zuora, and what query can be used?","response":"To track changes to the Bill Cycle Day (BCD) for an account, use the following query: select * from auditobjectchangeevent where objecttype = 'Account' AND Attributeid='BillCycleDay' AND updateddate>=Date AND Objectid='' ORDER BY timestamp DESC. This query retrieves audit events for BCD changes within a specified time frame for a given account.","category":"procedural","topic":"Tracking Bill Cycle Day changes"}
