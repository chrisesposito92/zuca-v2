{"instruction":"What do the values 'L' and 'R' represent in the 'Accounting Type' field of the Unbilled Fx Report?","response":"The values 'L' and 'R' in the Accounting Type field of the Unbilled Fx Report typically relate to your specific accounting type setup configuration. You should review the accounting type setup in your environment to confirm what these specific codes map to for your implementation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR data migration require specific handling for subscriptions with a large number of versions (e.g., >200)?","response":"If the data is standard out-of-the-box (OOTB), specific issues are not anticipated solely due to version count. However, challenges often arise from data quality issues, such as owner transfers or account deletions occurring over those versions. If issues arise during migration, a support ticket should be raised for engineering assistance.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Can Revenue GL fields on the ProductRatePlanCharge (PRPC) be updated via API?","response":"Yes, you can update the revenue GL accounts on the PRPC using the PUT API endpoint: `https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/operation/PUT_RevProAccountingCodes/`.","category":"procedural","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"How are discounts handled in OTR, specifically regarding mapping to GL accounts and charges?","response":"In OTR, a Discount charge is treated as part of the regular charge it applies to. There are settings to allow Discounts to use their own GL accounts and dates. If you require the discount to be treated as a completely separate distinct charge with different behavior, you may need to use a non-discount charge type. For mapping, fields like `ApplyToSubscriptionID` or `Discount Applied to Rate Plan Charge` in the Booking Transaction object can be used to establish relationships.","category":"definitional","topic":"Discounts"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended solution for a customer with a single OTR tenant selling in multiple functional currencies (e.g., USD and EUR) across different entities?","response":"The recommended solution for handling multiple functional currencies across different entities (e.g., US and Ireland) is to use Multi-Org in Zuora Billing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected CCV for pending charges if 'Generate all charges' is selected for Booking Transaction generation?","response":"Currently, the CCV for pending charges remains zero. A feature to provide estimated CCV based on estimated dates is in development but not yet available as of early 2025.","category":"definitional","topic":"CCV Calculation"}
{"instruction":"How is CCV calculated if a Fixed Amount Discount (FAD) is removed from a subscription?","response":"If a FAD is removed (e.g., from the beginning), the regular charge CCV reflects the full amount, and the FAD charge CCV will reflect only the discount amount that was actually billed prior to removal.","category":"definitional","topic":"CCV Calculation"}
{"instruction":"Can BookingTransaction and BillingTransaction objects be extracted from Zuora Billing to a Data Warehouse?","response":"Yes, these objects can be extracted to a data warehouse using an AQUA query.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Extraction"}
{"instruction":"Should custom fields for revenue reporting be mapped to the Booking or Billing transaction object?","response":"It depends on the specific use case. For example, if you are using standalone invoicing to form a revenue contract, fields should be mapped to the Billing Transaction object. The mapping location should align with the object driving the revenue logic.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Is Multi-Currency supported for K2 customers?","response":"No, Multi-Currency is not supported in the RevProIntegrationV2 (K2) environment. Customers must onboard with Order to Revenue (OTR) to utilize the Multi-Currency feature.","category":"comparison","topic":"Multi-Currency"}
{"instruction":"What steps should be taken to troubleshoot a subscription that fails to sync to Revenue?","response":"To troubleshoot sync issues: 1. Use Data Query to confirm data generated in Billing. 2. Check logs to see if the `SOLineId` was sent to Sunergy (Revenue integration layer). 3. Query the `zb_uno_event` table for `sent_on` and `received_on` timestamps. 4. Verify if Sunergy received the transaction.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sync Troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"Does enabling Invoice Item Settlement (IIS) impact OTR?","response":"No, OTR supports both Invoice Item Adjustment (IIA) and Invoice Settlement (IS). IIS relates to how payments apply to billing documents and does not negatively impact OTR.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"Can reconciliation tables (e.g., RPRO_UNO_RECON_*) be exposed to customers for Data Warehouse reporting?","response":"No, these are temporary internal tables and should not be exposed. Customers should extract the standard `BookingTransaction` and `BillingTransaction` objects from Billing to build their own reconciliation or reporting views.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Reconciliation"}
{"instruction":"Can prepayment charges flow into revenue as usage charges instead of 'Upon Event'?","response":"Typically, a prepayment charge represents cash on account (liability) and is not itself revenue. The revenue recognition event is triggered by the consumption (usage) items that draw down that balance.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepaid"}
{"instruction":"Does performing a suspend and resume action on the same day create a new charge segment?","response":"If the relevant permission is enabled, suspend and resume actions on the same day will split the segment. The system generally defaults to using enhanced CCV logic.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"What should be checked if a user cannot access or save OTR Settings?","response":"Check the user role permissions. The \"Manage OTR Settings\" privilege must be enabled. If the standard Administrator role does not have this visible, you may need to create a new custom role with this specific permission enabled.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Permissions"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support 'prepaid cash with drawdown' and does it impact revenue?","response":"Prepaid cash with drawdown is primarily a payment/collection feature and does not directly affect revenue. Revenue is driven by the orders and subsequent consumption/usage.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepaid"}
{"instruction":"How is the estimated end date derived for recurring charges on evergreen subscriptions in OTR?","response":"In OTR, the estimated end date for evergreen subscriptions is typically calculated as the current term plus one additional Billing Period (BP).","category":"definitional","topic":"Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"Is the API to regenerate booking transactions public?","response":"Yes, the Regenerate API is public. Documentation is available under the 'Regenerate' tag in the API reference.","category":"definitional","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"How does the backfill utility handle revenue fields for Product Rate Plan Charges (PRPC) versus Invoice Items?","response":"The auto-backfill utility copies revenue field values from the PRPC to the Rate Plan Charge (RPC) and Order Line Item (OLI). It does *not* automatically update Invoice Items or Memo Items; flags for those must be updated manually if needed.","category":"procedural","topic":"Backfill"}
{"instruction":"What happens to OTR settings when a Revenue Sandbox is refreshed from Production?","response":"If OTR is not enabled in the source Production environment, refreshing the Sandbox will reset the OTR settings (profiles). OTR settings are not automatically preserved if the source does not have them.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"Is it supported to change the Bill Cycle Day (BCD) for an OTR customer?","response":"Changing BCD is generally complex in OTR. However, if the BCD change occurs alongside a Terms & Conditions (T&C) order action (e.g., switching from monthly to annual on a new date), it is supported. The first CCV will use the billed amount.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Bill Cycle Day"}
{"instruction":"Can custom fields on the Contact object be mapped to Revenue?","response":"It is not recommended to map custom fields from the Contact object because updates to contact fields are not automatically synced to Revenue, which can lead to reporting inconsistencies. It is better to use snapshot fields (like Bill To/Sold To) or capture the data at the Subscription level.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How can historical unbilled usage be migrated to Revenue?","response":"Historical data cannot be converted to unbilled usage during migration. A common workaround is to perform a consumption upload to release the revenue for those historical periods.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"What is the logic for 'Sales Order Line ID' and 'Sales Order Line Number' in the Booking Transaction object?","response":"The `Sales Order Line ID` maps to the original Rate Plan Charge (RPC) Segment ID. The `Sales Order Line Number` maps to the Charge Number.","category":"definitional","topic":"Booking Transaction"}
{"instruction":"Does the inline discount functionality support Pay-As-You-Go (PayGo) usage?","response":"Yes, inline discounts support unbilled usage (PayGo) and PPDD (Prepaid with Drawdown), but they do not support committed usage models.","category":"definitional","topic":"Discounts"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'Before Validate' and 'Before Bundle Explode' stages in Data Augmentation?","response":"'Before Validate' runs before validation logic on the source data. 'Before Bundle Explode' runs after validation but before the bundle is exploded; this stage is useful for applying generic manipulations that should trickle down to parent and child lines to avoid duplicating efforts.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Augmentation"}
{"instruction":"How does OTR Data Migration determine which subscriptions and charges to migrate based on the cutover date?","response":"Migration selects subscriptions where the cutover date falls between the Term Start and Term End dates. For selected subscriptions, charges active in that term (and their history, if amended) are migrated. If a recurring charge is active in the current term but was added in a previous term, its history is also included.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"What are the default values for 'Allocation Eligible' and 'Right To Bill' revenue flags?","response":"The default value for these flags is 'No'. This is intentional to force a detailed analysis during enablement. You can use the data backfill tool to update these fields on the Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC).","category":"procedural","topic":"Configuration"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended order for enabling Invoice Settlement (IS) and OTR?","response":"While they are independent, for existing customers undergoing billing modernization, it is recommended to enable and validate Invoice Settlement (IS) first before proceeding with OTR data migration.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Enablement"}
{"instruction":"Should allocation be enabled for standalone/adhoc Credit Memos in OTR?","response":"It is generally recommended to disable allocation for standalone Credit Memos, as these are typically used for write-offs or goodwill and should not impact the original booking allocation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"Is unposting invoices supported in OTR?","response":"Unposting invoices is strongly discouraged and often disabled in OTR because it causes 'double invoicing' issues in Revenue (original + reversal + new invoice). The recommended practice is to use Invoice Reversal or Invoice Item Adjustments.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR Data Migration support evergreen subscriptions?","response":"Yes, evergreen subscriptions participate in data migration as long as they are active (effective end date is blank/open).","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"What should be done if the 'Change Plan' order action is needed in an OTR-enabled tenant, given that documentation suggests it might not be supported?","response":"While some documentation (specifically regarding K2 integration) states that 'Change Plan' is not supported, OTR (Order to Revenue) does support the 'Change Plan' order action. The confusion often arises because documentation for K2 (Billing-Revenue Integration) lists it as unsupported. If an error like 'change plan is not supported' occurs, it may be because K2 permissions are still active. To resolve this, ensure that the tenant is correctly configured for OTR and that K2 permissions are disabled if OTR is the intended integration method. You should confirm with the support or engineering team that the tenant settings are correct.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"OTR Order Actions"}
{"instruction":"How should credit card surcharges be handled in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Credit card surcharges are typically considered a reduction in cost or a separate fee and do not integrate natively into Zuora Revenue as standard revenue items. They usually generate a debit memo (DM). If the 'Exclude Item from Revenue Accounting' flag is not configured, the surcharge (as a DM) and any subsequent refunds or write-offs may flow to revenue, which is often not the desired behavior. The recommended approach is often to exclude these transactions from revenue accounting via the exclude flags. If a refund occurs, unapplying the payment and refunding both the surcharge and the original invoice is the standard process, where the surcharge DM is automatically written off.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Credit Card Surcharges"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to support usage-based credits or 'SLA' style credits based on transaction volume in OTR?","response":"For usage-based credits (e.g., SLA penalties or volume-based rebates), Zuora Billing supports creating a usage charge with a negative per-unit price (e.g., 250 transactions @ -0.03 = -$7.50). This results in a negative charge that can be processed. However, typically revenue cannot recognize usage charges that are negative directly as standard usage. Mediation can calculate the credit, but the resulting negative usage charge needs to be handled carefully. It effectively acts as a rebate or reduction in transaction fees.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Credits"}
{"instruction":"Why does the error 'Amount Based Events is Not Supported only for Recurring charges' occur when sending One Time charges with amount-based event release?","response":"This error occurs because Amount Based Events are generally designed for recurring charges in the standard configuration. If you are attempting to use them for One Time charges in an OTR instance, you may encounter this limitation. This is often a configuration or product limitation that requires verification with the Revenue product team.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Amount Based Events"}
{"instruction":"How can I fix the 'No Open Periods' error in Zuora Revenue after creating a new Org and mapping it, while the Default Org works fine?","response":"If you create a new Org in Revenue and map it to Billing entities, but see 'No Open Periods', you likely need to open the periods for that specific new Org in the Revenue Console. If the Default Org works but the new one doesn't, ensure the new Org is active and periods are explicitly opened for it. If you revert to the Default Org, you may need to adjust the Org mapping in Billing. However, editing Org mapping in Billing might be restricted after initial setup, requiring a support ticket to redo the mapping.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Org Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Will the new pending orders functionality work in Revenue if a customer is on Order Harmony (OH)?","response":"Yes, if a customer is on Order Harmony (OH), the new pending orders functionality should work in Revenue, provided the customer is using Orders within OH.","category":"definitional","topic":"Order Harmony"}
{"instruction":"What are the requirements for merging an OTR-enabled child entity with Zuora Revenue (Multi-Entity)?","response":"When merging entities in a Multi-Entity hierarchy where OTR is involved, the OTR setting must be enabled at the Global entity level. Both Global and Child entities should use a single integration method (OTR) and should not mix K2 and OTR. If migrating data to a new entity, ensure the global settings are correct.","category":"procedural","topic":"Multi-Entity Merge"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'Split Segment' setting recommended for ZB-ZR integration in OTR?","response":"Yes, the recommendation is to keep 'Split Segment' ON in OTR. Turning it OFF carries risks regarding how segments and revenue are handled, so enabling it is the standard best practice.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Split Segment"}
{"instruction":"How can I link CM-ROs (Credit Memo - Revenue Operations) to original Invoice transactions on the ZR side to fix exchange rate inheritance issues?","response":"In credit proration scenarios (e.g., remove product amendment), CM-ROs might inherit exchange rates from Sales Orders instead of the originating Invoices, causing FX differences. While this issue is addressed in the Q2 release, if you need to analyze the data or link them manually for impact analysis, there isn't a direct standard link exposed easily for end-users to modify FX inheritance without the fix. The system logic typically defaults to LIFO (Last In First Out) for credit memos against bookings.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Does pre-rated usage sent to Zuora Billing cause issues in Revenue for OTR customers not using SSP?","response":"Pre-rated usage sent to Billing acts as an unbilled usage upload. It generally has no negative impact on Revenue in OTR. It flows through as usage data.","category":"definitional","topic":"Pre-rated Usage"}
{"instruction":"Can I modify seeded POB templates (e.g., 'Upon Order Activation Ratable') to add VC types?","response":"You should not modify or make copies of seeded POB templates. The best practice is to create a new POB template from scratch if you need specific configurations like Variable Consideration (VC) or different cost rules, rather than trying to enable them on the seeded templates.","category":"best_practice","topic":"POB Templates"}
{"instruction":"Why are exchange rates missing in Revenue for booking transactions even if they are loaded in Billing for the order date?","response":"If exchange rates are loaded in Billing but not flowing to Revenue booking transactions, it may be a system sync issue or a specific bug (e.g., missing exchange rate issue on charges). In such cases, regenerating the booking transaction often does not fix it if the underlying sync failed. A support ticket is usually required to investigate why the rates didn't propagate.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Is 'Billing Based Revenue Recognition' a valid option for new OTR customers?","response":"While Billing-based revenue recognition allows for accurate accounting by processing only invoices, it is generally not recommended for new OTR customers. The feature exists primarily to support existing K2 customers transitioning to OTR. New OTR customers should rely on the standard OTR booking/billing flows.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing Based Rev Rec"}
{"instruction":"How can I update OTR fields (like 'Exclude from Revenue') to be blank/null via data backfill if the system returns a 'value is required' error?","response":"If you are trying to exclude a Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) from revenue using data backfill, you do not need to populate all other OTR fields. You can simply provide the Charge ID and set the 'Exclude Item Booking from Revenue Accounting' and 'Exclude Item Billing from Revenue Accounting' columns to 'True'. You do not need to set other fields to blank; omitting them or focusing on the exclude flags is sufficient.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Backfill"}
{"instruction":"Why is usage uploaded in Billing not syncing to Revenue (rpro_daily_cnsmp_prestg_g table)?","response":"If usage is uploaded in Billing but not appearing in Revenue, check if 'Unbill Usage' is enabled. After enabling it, a migration by the engineering team might be required. Also, verify if the Daily Consumption object in DSE has values. Large data volumes in other tenants can sometimes cause processing delays (lag) in the shared environment.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Sync"}
{"instruction":"What is the source field for 'BookingTransaction.CurrentELP'?","response":"'BookingTransaction.CurrentELP' (Extended List Price) is calculated by OTR and does not have a direct source field in Billing. It is derived. If you see a $0 ELP where you expect a value, check the 'Original List Price' in the order action. If the list price in the Product Catalog (PRPC) is 0, you must set the 'originalListPrice' field in the Orders call to ensure the correct override value is used for calculation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Booking Transaction Fields"}
{"instruction":"Why are Revenue accounts missing in the Product Catalog UI for an OTR tenant?","response":"This is a known UI issue that can sometimes be related to VPN or network settings (e.g., Zscaler policies). Disconnecting from the VPN or updating Zscaler policies often resolves the visibility of Revenue accounts in the Billing UI. Alternatively, you can verify the fields exist via a data query or use data backfill to update them if the UI is blocked.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Product Catalog UI"}
{"instruction":"How does multi-currency behave in Zuora Revenue with OTR?","response":"In OTR, multi-currency support allows users to have multiple transaction currencies at the subscription or OLI level. There is no major change in how OTR or ZR works compared to standard logic; the system uses the transaction currency from the subscription. The major experience change is in Billing (capturing currencies at the sub level), while Revenue consumes the data as provided.","category":"definitional","topic":"Multi-Currency"}
{"instruction":"Can we execute a 'Change Plan' order action in OTR?","response":"Yes, OTR supports the 'Change Plan' order action. The limitation often cited in documentation refers to K2 (Billing-Revenue Integration), not OTR.","category":"definitional","topic":"Change Plan"}
{"instruction":"How can we migrate Product Catalog Revenue Accounting fields in an OTR implementation?","response":"Deployment Manager does not support migrating Revenue Accounting fields. The recommended approach is to use the Data Loader (Update Product Rate Plan Charge template). You can update fields like 'AllocationEligible', 'RevenueRecognitionTiming', 'RevenueAmortizationMethod', and 'Exclude' flags. The 'Right to Bill Flag' corresponds to the 'IsUnbilled' field in the PRPC API.","category":"procedural","topic":"Product Catalog Migration"}
{"instruction":"Is there a dashboard to monitor OTR connector performance?","response":"Currently, there is no customer-facing health dashboard for the OTR connector (unlike the Salesforce connector). The sync is designed to be near real-time. Performance monitoring is managed internally by the Product/Engineering teams.","category":"definitional","topic":"OTR Performance"}
{"instruction":"How can we split revenue between a partner and company account for the same subscription in OTR?","response":"The best approach is to use separate GL accounts rather than a bundle upload. Create a subscription with multiple usage charges—one for the partner and one for the company. When usage is uploaded, it will automatically take the GL account associated with the respective charge, splitting the revenue automatically during processing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Revenue Split"}
{"instruction":"Can we continue to run the ZBilling Revenue Detail Report after enabling OTR?","response":"Generally, enabling OTR turns off ZBilling Revenue capabilities. However, some customers want ZBilling to create Revenue Schedules for reporting (Revenue Detail Report) without creating Journal Entries. This is a specific configuration question, but typically OTR replaces ZBilling revenue recognition.","category":"definitional","topic":"ZBilling Reports"}
{"instruction":"Can we map custom fields to both RPC and OLI using the same attribute (e.g., ATR1) in OTR billing templates?","response":"In the Booking template, you can map the same attribute (ATR1) to custom fields on both RPC and OLI. However, in the Billing template, once an attribute is mapped to an RPC custom field, it may not be available for mapping to the OLI object. This is a known limitation in the Billing template mapping.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How should 'Usage Charges' be handled in OTR for consumption revenue?","response":"Usage charges should ideally be handled using the Consumption revenue model. Using standard usage charges with manually created POBs is not recommended. If you have a consumption use case (e.g., active prospect with free units and overage), use the standard Consumption POBs rather than custom ones. The system defaults the list price on usage charges to $0 in some contexts, so rely on the consumption/mediation flow.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Charges"}
{"instruction":"Can we update custom fields on an invoice line after it has been collected in Revenue?","response":"No, updates to billing transactions (like invoice lines) are not allowed after they are collected. You cannot simply update the field and sync it. The workaround is usually to regenerate the booking/billing transactions if the period is open, but if already collected and processed, you may need to unapply/reverse or use a custom solution (which is difficult). Direct updates are blocked.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Invoice Updates"}
{"instruction":"What is the 'Right to Bill Flag' in the Product Rate Plan Charge API?","response":"The 'Right to Bill Flag' corresponds to the `IsUnbilled` field in the Product Rate Plan Charge API.","category":"definitional","topic":"API Fields"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support Invoice Adjustments (IA)?","response":"OTR only supports Invoice Item Adjustments. It does not support header-level Invoice Adjustments. If a customer needs adjustments, they must be at the line item level.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Adjustments"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle a scenario where a manually created Credit Memo (CM) was applied to an invoice but a second CM was automatically generated?","response":"If a manually created CM (standalone) is applied, and the system also generates a CM (e.g., from an invoice reversal or similar action), you may end up with duplicates in Revenue. The recommended approach is to identify which CM is valid for revenue. If the second CM (CM2) is invalid or duplicate, you should write it off or purge it from the stage (if not collected). Ensure only the valid revenue-impacting CM is processed.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"What are the limitations of OTR regarding 'Terms and Conditions' changes (Decreasing/Increasing Term)?","response":"There are known limitations when changing terms in OTR, specifically 'Decreasing term' and 'Increasing term when billing in advance'. If a term decrease occurs on an invoiced segment, a CM-C (Credit Memo-Cancellation) is generated. If the term creates a new segment, Billing might extend the segment instead, resulting in a CM-C that never gets a corresponding CM-RO (Revenue Operations) from upstream, leading to sync issues.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Term Changes"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support 'Change Plan' order actions?","response":"Yes, OTR supports 'Change Plan' order actions. Documentation stating it is unsupported refers to K2 (Legacy Billing-Revenue Integration).","category":"definitional","topic":"Change Plan"}
{"instruction":"How can I exclude specific billing items (Invoices, CMs) from Revenue in OTR?","response":"You can exclude specific billing items using the `Exclude Item Billing from Revenue Accounting` flag. This flag is available on Credit Memos (CMs) and Invoices via API. It allows you to prevent specific transactions from flowing to Revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"Revenue Exclusion"}
{"instruction":"What should be done if a 'Split Segment' is required for OTR?","response":"It is strongly recommended to keep 'Split Segment' ON in OTR configurations to ensure proper revenue handling and avoid risks associated with segment processing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Split Segment"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support the 'Reflect Discount in Apply To Charge Net Amount' setting for Per Unit Pricing models?","response":"Currently, the event-based revenue recognition in OTR (which uses `Reflect Discount in Apply To Charge Net Amount`) primarily supports Delivery Pricing and Daily Consumption models. Support for Per Unit Pricing models with this specific discount reflection setting in OTR is limited or requires verification of the specific use case (often not supported out of the box).","category":"definitional","topic":"Discount Settings"}
{"instruction":"How do I map the 'Invoice Owner' to the 'Customer' field in Revenue for booking transactions?","response":"OTR maps the Subscription Owner as the Customer in Revenue by default. Mapping the Invoice Owner is possible but not ideal; standard mapping allows Name and Account Number. Standard attributes on the Invoice Owner might not be fully available for mapping to the Customer field in Revenue without custom configuration or workarounds.","category":"procedural","topic":"Customer Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How can I monitor the sync delay or 'lag' between Billing and Revenue in OTR?","response":"There is no customer-facing dashboard for sync lag yet (ticket UNO-3862 tracks this). You can check the 'Data Source' in Revenue to see if Booking/Billing transactions exist. If they exist in Data Source but not in Revenue Stage/Tables, there is a lag in ingestion. If they don't exist in Data Source, you can use the 'Regenerate' API to force the transaction generation.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sync Lag"}
{"instruction":"Is 'Order Owner Transfer' supported in OTR?","response":"Yes, Subscription Owner Transfer triggers a booking transaction update in Revenue (often seen as a version update). However, Invoice Owner Transfer does not trigger a booking transaction update in Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"Owner Transfer"}
{"instruction":"Can I map the 'Relative Invoice' (or Related Invoice) field on a Credit Memo to Revenue?","response":"Currently, the 'Related Invoice' field on a Credit Memo is not natively exposed for mapping in the standard OTR integration. You can map `BillingTransaction.InvoiceId` for the Credit Memo, but the specific 'Related Invoice' number field requires a product enhancement (User story UNO-3796 exists for this).","category":"definitional","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Can we set a future target date for evergreen subscriptions to generate a single invoice and SO update?","response":"Yes, using a future dated target date for evergreen subscriptions is supported and typically results in a single invoice in the system, which is the expected behavior.","category":"procedural","topic":"Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How can we avoid revenue staging duplication during evergreen subscription migration if the automation tool triggers draft invoices for every order?","response":"This issue often stems from automation tooling triggering the invoice API for every order, creating multiple booking transactions. The recommended approach is to verify where the migration flag is applied and, if possible, load all accounts and orders first before running the Bill Run API at the end. Even if the Bill Run is invoked per order, it should be scoped to the specific subscription.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Is there a direct link between the OTR stage table and the Order Line Item (OLI) object?","response":"Yes, for OTR customers, you can link the stage table to the Order Line Item object by joining the `salesorderlineid` in the stage table with the `salesorderlineid` in the booking transaction, which matches the ID in the Order Line Item object.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Model"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for refreshing an OTR environment to ensure data consistency?","response":"It is recommended to refresh both the billing and revenue environments to avoid data inconsistency. If you need to revert a sandbox to a specific state (e.g., non-OTR matching Production), a refresh from Production will copy the relevant permissions and data.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Environment Management"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'Consume Deleted Transaction' setting affect deleted orders or amendments in OTR?","response":"If `CONSUME_DELETED_TRANSACTION` is disabled, deleted transactions may cause errors or remain in the inbound stage. Enabling it allows the system to process these deletions. Note that the 'Delete Amendment' feature for OTR is targeted for a future release (2025.Q4). Generally, deleting orders is not recommended; best practice is to use de-book/rebook or invoice reversals.","category":"definitional","topic":"Deleted Transactions"}
{"instruction":"Which date is used to derive the exchange rate in OTR integration?","response":"OTR integration typically uses the Invoice Date (Document Date) to derive the exchange rate.","category":"definitional","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Can we map custom fields from both Invoice and Credit Memo objects to the same ATR field in Revenue?","response":"Directly mapping custom fields from both Invoice and Credit Memo objects to the same ATR field at the object level is not supported. However, mapping is allowed for Invoice Items and Credit Memo Items. For OTR, mapping RPC and OLI to the same ATR is supported. To map fields like 'Ship To Country' to standard Revenue fields, they must typically be mapped to a revenue attribute first.","category":"procedural","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'Order Upgrade with Invoice Settlement' feature mandatory for OTR?","response":"No, Order and Invoice Settlement are independent features. OTR supports Subscribe/Amend, Orders, and Invoice Settlement.","category":"definitional","topic":"OTR Requirements"}
{"instruction":"How are FX rates handled for future-dated orders if the rate is not yet available?","response":"Booking transaction FX rates are calculated at the time of generation and do not auto-regenerate. It is recommended to not use future dates for the Order/Booking date; instead, use the current date and set the Effective Date to the future. If transactions fail due to missing rates, you may need to load rates into Revenue manually.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Do Booking and Billing Transaction objects automatically update when an Order is deleted?","response":"No, if the booking or billing transaction has already been generated, it will not be automatically deleted when the upstream Order is deleted.","category":"definitional","topic":"Transaction Sync"}
{"instruction":"Can we group subscriptions from different Billing orgs into a single Revenue Contract?","response":"Yes, if the Revenue tenant is single-org, you can group subscriptions from different Billing orgs into one revenue contract using a common attribute. Be aware that allocations and modifications across different company codes may trigger intercompany accounting entries.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"Can Invoice Item Adjustments (IIA) be regenerated and synced to Revenue?","response":"Yes, IIAs are supported in OTR. You can use the Billing Transaction regeneration API to sync them. Note that Tax IIAs generally do not sync to revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"Transaction Regeneration"}
{"instruction":"Why might there be a small discrepancy between Invoice TCV and Sales Order CCV in migrated data?","response":"TCV does not sync to revenue. Discrepancies between Invoice TCV and Sales Order CCV in migrated data are often due to specific bugs or data inconsistencies which should be reported to support.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Consistency"}
{"instruction":"Why does a subscription cancellation sometimes not create a booking transaction in Revenue?","response":"If a subscription is cancelled effective on its original term end date (natural end), it is treated as a non-impacting event and no booking transaction is generated. Cancellations effectively before the term end (early termination) should generate booking transactions.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Cancellation"}
{"instruction":"Why are booking transactions failing to sync to Revenue despite being generated in Billing?","response":"This can occur due to mapping issues. For example, a mismatch in field length for `FV_ELIGIBLE_FLAG` (Billing sending 'true'/'false' vs Revenue expecting 1 char) has been known to cause sync failures.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sync Errors"}
{"instruction":"How is Extended List Price (ELP) calculated for Prepayment charges?","response":"For prepayment charges, there is no proration. The ELP is calculated as the full amount for the validity period.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepayment"}
{"instruction":"How do we map the Invoice Number for a Credit Memo Item in OTR?","response":"You can map `INV.invoice number` in the billing transaction mapping to a revenue attribute to capture the invoice number for credit memo items.","category":"procedural","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support single version subscriptions?","response":"Yes, OTR supports single version subscriptions. However, there have been reported issues with fields like Product Family or Rev Rec Timing being blank in Booking Transactions for these subscriptions, which may require a fix.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"Can usage revenue be recognized prior to invoicing (Right to Bill)?","response":"Yes. This requires a pure usage charge and a POB template set to 'Consumption Usage (Non-Comitted)'. You must also run the 'Process Usage to Revenue conversion' (Usage Master process) to recognize the revenue prior to billing.","category":"procedural","topic":"Usage Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What are best practices for OTR Data Migration?","response":"Key best practices include: establishing a pre/post-migration reconciliation framework; batching data collection (e.g., 1M-5M records); ensuring accounting codes are unique (duplicates can block backfill); and monitoring for performance (subscriptions take longer than invoices). For testing subsets of data (mocks), consider using the Regenerate API instead of the full Data Migration job.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can we update FX rates for an invoice if they were missing during initial generation?","response":"You can use the regenerate API with the parameter `remigrate=true`. This purges the existing booking/billing transactions and rebuilds them, which should pick up the newly available FX rates.","category":"procedural","topic":"Transaction Regeneration"}
{"instruction":"How is the 'Semi-Annual' billing period handled in OTR mapping?","response":"There is a known issue where 'Semi-Annual' may be translated to 'Semi_Annual' (with an underscore). Until fixed, you may need Data Augmentation (DA) rules to handle both value formats.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Billing Period"}
{"instruction":"Can we map custom fields from a Usage record in Billing to Revenue?","response":"Currently, direct mapping of custom fields from usage records to Revenue is not supported. Workarounds include using the revenue upload functionality or deriving values from other available attributes.","category":"definitional","topic":"Usage Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle duplicate accounting codes blocking OTR backfill?","response":"Duplicate accounting codes (e.g., one active, one inactive with the same name) can cause backfill validation failures. The recommended workaround is to rename the inactive code if possible. A platform enhancement is planned to respect the active/inactive status.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Accounting Codes"}
{"instruction":"How can we create a Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) with revenue fields via API?","response":"If the create API does not support revenue fields directly, you can: 1. Set 'Allow Blank Accounting Codes' to Yes; 2. Create the PRPC; 3. Use the `PUT_RevProAccountingCodes` endpoint to set the revenue fields; 4. Revert the 'Allow Blank Accounting Codes' setting.","category":"procedural","topic":"API Usage"}
{"instruction":"Is it recommended to close accounting periods in Zuora Billing for OTR?","response":"Yes, it is highly recommended to close accounting periods in Billing to ensure no transactions are created in closed periods, which facilitates accurate auditing and revenue reconciliation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Accounting Periods"}
{"instruction":"Which Fixed Amount Discount (FAD) allocation option supports allocation at the FAD-line level?","response":"Option 2 (Generate Actual value in Booking Transaction) or Option 4 (Generate Actual Amount as a Standalone Booking Line) are suitable for line-level allocation. However, Option 2 may have limitations with usage or evergreen subscriptions.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Fixed Amount Discounts"}
{"instruction":"Does data migration include subscriptions created between the cutoff date and the migration run?","response":"Data migration is typically based on a 'From Date'. It generally includes all active and evergreen subscriptions relevant to that start date range.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Does the regenerate API bring in all versions of a subscription?","response":"The regenerate API brings in 'impacted' SO lines where revenue-impacting fields have changed. If a version change does not affect revenue fields, a corresponding line might not be generated.","category":"definitional","topic":"Transaction Regeneration"}
{"instruction":"Why do Fixed Amount Discount (FAD) revenue dates not update upon cancellation?","response":"FAD revenue dates typically flow blindly from billing or follow the recurring charge. If 'Generate Zero $' is configured, revenue is controlled by invoice items. Cancellation usually results in a Credit Memo rather than an update to the discount line's dates.","category":"definitional","topic":"Fixed Amount Discounts"}
{"instruction":"Are split segments needed if renewals come from an external CPQ (like Salesforce) as amendments?","response":"Yes, split segments are needed. A new term is expected to appear as a separate SO line in Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"Split Segments"}
{"instruction":"How are negative unit price usage charges handled in OTR?","response":"Negative unit price usage charges should generally generate an Invoice (INV), but may generate a Credit Memo (CM-C) if the billing item amount is negative. This behavior varies based on the specific scenario.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What do AMENDMENT_TYPE values like QTY_I or TERM_D mean in the stage table?","response":"These values indicate the type of amendment trigger: `QTY_I`/`QTY_D` for Quantity Increase/Decrease, `TERM_I`/`TERM_D` for Term changes, and `PRC_I`/`PRC_D` for Price changes.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Model"}
{"instruction":"Will a renewal line pick up a new account code if it is changed in the Product Catalog?","response":"For existing RPCs, they will typically retain the old account code even for new segments. Only totally new RPCs or Orders will pick up the new code automatically. To update existing lines, a data backfill is required.","category":"procedural","topic":"Account Codes"}
{"instruction":"How are evergreen subscriptions grouped in Revenue?","response":"If the grouping rule is 'Subscription Name + Term Number', evergreen subscriptions (which retain the same term number) are grouped into a single contract. The revenue end date extends based on invoicing.","category":"definitional","topic":"Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"Why does a cancellation credit memo sometimes not offset revenue correctly?","response":"If settings like 'Invoice Past End-of-Term' are enabled and a product is billed, a CM-C might be automatically created for the term exceeding the subscription. This behavior is driven by complex interactions between billing rules and revenue recognition settings.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Cancellation"}
{"instruction":"How can I ensure consistent invoice amounts when using Delivery-Based Pricing with a specific delivery schedule (e.g., Monday-Saturday)?","response":"For Delivery-Based Pricing with specific delivery days, the charge's billing period should be set to 'Week' rather than 'Month'. Using 'Month' can result in inconsistent invoice amounts due to the varying number of days or weeks in a month, whereas 'Week' ensures alignment with the weekly delivery schedule.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Delivery-Based Pricing"}
{"instruction":"Is there a streamlined way to implement mid-term subscription-level price increases across a large customer base without using CSV uploads?","response":"Currently, the Batch Price Update widget is best suited for updating one rate plan charge at a time. For updating hundreds of different charges or subscriptions simultaneously, there is no streamlined UI tool available; the recommended approach is to prepare and upload CSV files using the Data Loader tool.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Batch Price Updates"}
{"instruction":"Who can run an analysis to determine if a tenant requires Performance & Bill Run Enhancement (PBE)?","response":"The Beehive team (specifically internal contacts like Sidi Zhu) can run an analysis to provide optimization options and identify if PBE is necessary for a specific tenant.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Performance Analysis"}
{"instruction":"Which customers can be referenced for HighRadius integration with Zuora?","response":"Zillow and Zoom are referenceable customers using HighRadius integration, specifically for dunning and lockbox payment use cases.","category":"comparison","topic":"HighRadius Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are the common solutions for offline provisioning and entitlement management for IoT/Hardware devices?","response":"Common off-the-shelf vendors include Thales and Flexera. Many enterprise customers build homegrown systems. Platforms like Azure IoT Hub or Kaa often require connectivity and may not support offline provisioning scenarios as effectively.","category":"comparison","topic":"IoT Provisioning"}
{"instruction":"How do I set up a demo for Dynamic Usage Charges?","response":"As Dynamic Usage Charges are currently in an Early Adopter (EA) phase, you should work directly with the Product Manager to ensure the use case is supported and properly configured for a demo.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Dynamic Usage Charges"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for writing off bad debt in Zuora Billing?","response":"There is no single \"official\" standardized workflow for bad debt write-offs as practices vary by customer and downstream revenue implications. Common approaches include using Credit Memos or specific bad-debt Rate Plan Charges, but the exact method should be aligned with the customer's accounting requirements.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Bad Debt Write-off"}
{"instruction":"Can promo codes be applied directly via the Zuora UI or the initial order payload?","response":"No, promo codes cannot be applied via the standard UI or a single order payload. The process typically requires three steps: (1) Call the Promo Codes API to validate the code, (2) Call the Promo Codes API to consume/burn the code, and (3) Create the subscription or order with the specific discount rate plan charge appended.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Promo Codes"}
{"instruction":"What is the refresh interval for the Data Warehouse Connector (e.g., BigQuery)?","response":"The Data Warehouse Connector currently supports data refreshes on a regular interval, typically every 24 hours. On-demand refresh capabilities are not currently standard.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Warehouse Connector"}
{"instruction":"How is Insurance typically modeled in Zuora regarding term length and risk factors?","response":"Insurance calculations (premiums based on age, risk, term) are typically performed outside of Zuora in a specialized policy platform. The final calculated premium is then passed to Zuora as a flat fee or price. While Attribute-Based Pricing exists, complex actuarial math is usually kept external.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Insurance Modeling"}
{"instruction":"How can I simulate payment failures in a demo or test environment?","response":"Most test gateways provide specific credit card numbers or dollar amounts that trigger hard or soft declines. For the internal Zuora Test Gateway, specific \"magic words\" or values are documented to simulate various failure response codes.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Failure Simulation"}
{"instruction":"Can Heroku be used as an integration layer between Zuora and Salesforce instead of the managed connector?","response":"Yes, building an app on Heroku to act as middleware is a valid architectural pattern. It allows for custom handling of events and data sync to Salesforce custom objects, avoiding the API limits or specific constraints of the out-of-the-box Zuora 360 managed package.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integration Architecture"}
{"instruction":"How should I model a \"markup\" option plan that is a percentage of a basic plan?","response":"Zuora does not natively support a charge model that automatically calculates a percentage markup of another independent product's price. The recommended best practice is to calculate the markup amount in the upstream CRM or ordering system and pass it to Zuora as a flat fee.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Percentage Uplift Charges"}
{"instruction":"Can the 40-character limit for the City field in Contacts be increased?","response":"No, the character limit for standard contact fields like City is not configurable. Increasing it requires a platform product change.","category":"definitional","topic":"Contact Field Limits"}
{"instruction":"Does Attribute Based Pricing (ABP) automatically re-evaluate prices when a custom field changes during a subscription amendment?","response":"No, ABP typically evaluates pricing at the time of the Order creation. Simply changing a custom field on the subscription or account mid-cycle does not automatically trigger a re-rating of existing recurring charges unless a specific order action forces a re-evaluation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Attribute Based Pricing"}
{"instruction":"How can I open multiple OneID tenants simultaneously?","response":"Since OneID manages the session at the browser level, you must use different browser profiles (e.g., Chrome Profiles) or a feature like Firefox Multi-Account Containers to maintain separate active sessions for different tenants at the same time.","category":"Procedural","topic":"OneID Management"}
{"instruction":"How many levels of taxation does Z-Tax support?","response":"Z-Tax supports up to three levels of taxation (e.g., Federal, State, Local) per transaction line.","category":"definitional","topic":"Z-Tax"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora Tax calculate a tax on top of a total that already includes GST (Tax on Tax)?","response":"Generally, Zuora Tax calculates taxes based on the line subtotal. To support \"tax on tax\" or stacked taxes (e.g., a surcharge on top of GST), you typically configure the second tax as a separate tax code applied to the base amount, or use an external tax engine if complex compounding logic is required.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Tax Configuration"}
{"instruction":"What are the key changes to Zuora Billing API versioning introduced in late 2024?","response":"Zuora moved from numbered API versions (e.g., 186.0) to date-based versioning (e.g., 2024-05-20). Additionally, a new \"API Versioning\" setting in the admin console allows you to view and upgrade the tenant's default API version.","category":"definitional","topic":"API Versioning"}
{"instruction":"Is there a pre-built GL Connector for Microsoft Business Central?","response":"There is no specific named connector for Business Central. You would typically use the \"Configurable Summary GL Connector\" to generate a CSV file which can then be ingested by Business Central, or build a custom integration.","category":"architectural","topic":"GL Connectors"}
{"instruction":"Can Salesforce CPQ and Zuora CPQ coexist in the same Salesforce environment?","response":"Yes, they can coexist, typically by bifurcating the quoting flows (separate buttons). Data conflict on shared objects like `Product2` must be managed, noting that the modern Zuora 360+ sync allows for more granular control over object syncing to avoid conflicts.","category":"architectural","topic":"CPQ Co-existence"}
{"instruction":"How can I generate invoices in two different languages for the same customer?","response":"Zuora's standard multi-lingual support generates an invoice in the single language defined by the account's locale. To support two languages simultaneously (e.g., a bilingual invoice), you typically need to create a custom HTML template that hardcodes labels in both languages, rather than relying solely on the locale setting.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"Does a customer expanding to a new region (e.g., EU from Japan) need a new tenant?","response":"Often yes, especially if there are distinct requirements for data residency, currency, accounting rules, or ERP integrations. While Multi-Entity is the standard solution for managing multiple business units, separate tenants are required if data must physically reside in a different data center.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Org Architecture"}
{"instruction":"How can I enable proration for only specific charges in the catalog?","response":"You can enable \"Charge Level Proration\" under Billing Settings > Manage Features. This allows you to define proration rules at the individual charge level rather than globally.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Proration Settings"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora prorate charges by hour?","response":"No, the Zuora rating engine calculates proration based on days. Hourly proration requires custom calculations (e.g., passing the pre-calculated rated amount via API).","category":"definitional","topic":"Proration Granularity"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer A/B test Smart Retry vs CPR?","response":"Since payment methods aren't attached at invoice generation, random splitting is difficult. A common approach is to define cohorts using Customer Groups or custom fields on the Account, and then configure the retry logic to apply different strategies to those specific groups.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Smart Retry Testing"}
{"instruction":"What is the advantage of using a Developer Sandbox (DSBX) over an API Sandbox with Deployment Manager?","response":"A Developer Sandbox (DSBX) created via \"Refresh from Prod\" creates an exact replica of the production configuration and settings instantly. Deployment Manager requires manual setup and may not cover every single configuration setting, making DSBX a more reliable \"reset button\" for testing.","category":"comparison","topic":"Sandbox Strategy"}
{"instruction":"How does Overage Smoothing work with a Prepaid Drawdown charge model?","response":"Prepaid Drawdown takes precedence; the system consumes the prepaid balance first. Overage Smoothing logic applies only to the usage that exceeds the prepaid balance (the true overage).","category":"definitional","topic":"Usage Smoothing"}
{"instruction":"Can I build a Billing Preview report directly in Zuora Reporting/Analytics?","response":"Not out-of-the-box. Billing Preview data is accessible via API or Developer Tools. To report on it in Analytics, you typically need to use a Data Query or Workflow to fetch the preview data and store it in a custom object or export it for external reporting.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Billing Preview Reporting"}
{"instruction":"How can I handle an overpayment without issuing a refund?","response":"An overpayment sits as a credit balance (liability). To clear it without refunding, you must apply it to a debit. This can be done by generating the next invoice early and applying the credit, or by creating a Debit Memo (though this may have accounting implications).","category":"best_practice","topic":"Overpayment Handling"}
{"instruction":"Can I retrieve raw credit card (PAN) data from Zuora to migrate to another provider?","response":"No, Zuora does not expose raw PAN data via API due to PCI compliance standards. Exceptions for raw data extraction are extremely rare, require strict indemnification, and are handled via a specialized professional services engagement, not self-service.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Data Portability"}
{"instruction":"Can I modify a subscription while it is in 'Pending' status?","response":"Historically, modifying pending subscriptions has been limited. Enhancements are on the roadmap (targeted for late 2024/early 2025) to allow cancellation or modification of pending orders. Currently, it is best practice to manage the order in an external system (CRM) and only push to Zuora once finalized.","category":"definitional","topic":"Pending Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How does the new Salesforce 360+ Connector differ from the legacy version?","response":"The new Salesforce 360+ connector (Billing connector for Salesforce CPQ) offers improved performance and granular control over which objects are synced, allowing admins to reduce data volume usage in Salesforce.","category":"comparison","topic":"Salesforce Connector"}
{"instruction":"Is there a recorded demo for CPQ X?","response":"Yes, recorded demos and Saleo capture assets for CPQ X are available on Highspot for internal use.","category":"general","topic":"CPQ X Demo"}
{"instruction":"How do I manage a Staging environment connected to an external system when refreshing the sandbox breaks ID mappings?","response":"Refreshing a Zuora sandbox changes the internal IDs, breaking mappings with external static staging environments. Best practice is to either treat the sandbox as a long-lived tenant (avoiding refresh) or build automation to re-seed/re-map the sandbox data from the external system immediately after a refresh.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Environment Management"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between MRR Forecast in Billing and Revenue Booking-based RevRec?","response":"The MRR Forecast in Billing is a non-GAAP projection of recurring revenue. Zuora Revenue's Booking-based RevRec provides a compliant ASC606/IFRS15 view that includes allocations, standalone selling price (SSP), and one-time fees, which the billing forecast does not cover.","category":"comparison","topic":"Revenue Forecasting"}
{"instruction":"How can I check a customer's feature usage (e.g., custom objects) without logging into their tenant?","response":"You can use the internal 'Cerebro' tool to look up the account and view the 'Entitlements' or 'Trends' tab, which displays usage metrics.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Internal Tooling"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora support a B2B2C 'Bill on Behalf Of' model?","response":"Yes, Zuora can support this using Customer Hierarchy features (separating Invoice Owner and Subscription Owner). It requires detailed discovery to map out liability, invoice delivery, and payment responsibility.","category":"architectural","topic":"B2B2C Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can I mass activate currencies for a new product?","response":"There is no UI button to mass activate currencies. You can use a Workflow to query the ProductRatePlan IDs and iteratively call the API to enable the desired currencies for each plan.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Currency Management"}
{"instruction":"What causes the 'Fail to find a matching Charge Definition' error in Attribute Based Pricing?","response":"This error typically occurs if the underlying Product Charge Definition has a NULL end date. Updating the charge definition with a valid far-future end date via API often resolves the issue.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Attribute Based Pricing"}
{"instruction":"Why should a customer use Zuora for Accounts Receivable instead of their ERP (e.g., NetSuite)?","response":"Using Zuora for AR allows for a 'Subledger' approach where Billing and Revenue data remain the source of truth, simplifying the ERP integration to just summary Journal Entries. It avoids the complexity of reconciling two systems and prevents the rigidity of ERP logic from hindering pricing and packaging agility.","category":"comparison","topic":"Zuora vs ERP for AR"}
{"instruction":"What is the feedback on the JP Morgan (Chase) Payment Gateway?","response":"Feedback is generally mixed to negative due to the difficulty of working with their support structure and legacy infrastructure. Modern gateways like Stripe or Adyen are often recommended alternatives for a smoother integration experience.","category":"comparison","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"Can I use AQuA in a Dev tenant to save costs while using Snowflake Secure Data Share in Prod?","response":"While possible, it is not recommended because AQuA and Snowflake Secure Data Share use different data models and formats. Queries built for AQuA in Dev will not be portable to Prod, negating the testing value.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Snowflake Integration"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora integrate with Microsoft Power Platform?","response":"Integration is possible (e.g., AIMS360 uses it), but there have been historical compatibility issues regarding Microsoft's handling of OpenAPI 3.0 recursive calls.","category":"architectural","topic":"Microsoft Power Platform"}
{"instruction":"Why does cancelling a One-Time Charge (OTC) not generate a credit?","response":"To credit back a One-Time Charge, the cancellation effective date must match the charge's original start date. If the dates do not match, the system assumes the charge was valid for that period and may not issue a credit.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"One-Time Charges"}
{"instruction":"How can I apply a minimum charge based on the aggregate of multiple usage records?","response":"Standard Minimum Commit works per billing period. To enforce a minimum per transaction or hour across aggregated usage, you would likely need to use the Mediation (Rating Processor) engine with custom aggregation logic before the data reaches the rating engine.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Rating"}
{"instruction":"How do I manage a ramp deal with changing prices over time?","response":"Ramp deals can be managed using the Ramp Deal feature in Orders or by creating multi-period Rate Plan Charges with effective dates that align with the price changes. Misalignment of amendment dates with charge segments can cause billing errors.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Ramp Deals"}
{"instruction":"Is there a pre-built connector for PeopleSoft Finance?","response":"No, there is no pre-built connector. Integration is typically achieved via a generic summary Journal Entry export (GL Connector) or a custom middleware integration.","category":"architectural","topic":"ERP Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can a customer rotate their Cybersource v1 gateway key?","response":"No, Cybersource has deprecated key generation for v1. Customers needing to rotate keys must migrate to the Cybersource v2 gateway integration.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Gateway Migration"}
{"instruction":"What are common use cases for the \"Minimum Commitment\" or \"Percentage of Spend\" revenue models?","response":"Common use cases include manufacturing scenarios or B2B contracts where maintenance and support costs are calculated as a percentage of total spend (e.g., a 10% support fee added to usage). Another prominent use case involves threshold notifications at the account level, where actions are triggered when a customer's aggregated usage across multiple subscriptions reaches a certain daily or monthly limit.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Revenue Models"}
{"instruction":"How can customers perform bulk amendments if they do not have the Developer Tools (Mass Order Entry) feature?","response":"If Developer Tools are not available, customers can use the standard Data Loader. While the specific \"Amendment\" data dictionary template might be missing from some documentation, the object is supported. Alternatively, customers can use the \"Orders - Charge Overrides\" template in Data Loader to perform add-product or update-product actions in bulk, though this template may require enablement via a support request.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Loader"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between the \"% Charge Model\" and the \"Commitment Spend Model\"?","response":"The \"% Charge Model\" (or % of Spend) is a pricing model where the charge amount is calculated as a percentage of another billed amount, typically tied to usage or overall spend (e.g., a 10% support fee on a $100k bill). The \"Commitment Spend Model\" is a contractual agreement where a customer commits to spending a minimum amount over a period (e.g., $2M/year). Actual charges are tracked against this commitment, and a true-up is invoiced if the minimum is not met.","category":"definitional","topic":"Revenue Models"}
{"instruction":"Is the Zuora Secure Data Share for Snowflake bi-directional?","response":"No, the Zuora Secure Data Share for Snowflake is a one-way sync from Zuora to the customer's Snowflake account. It does not support pushing data from Snowflake back into Zuora.","category":"definitional","topic":"Snowflake Connector"}
{"instruction":"What are the benefits of vaulting payment methods in Zuora compared to an external gateway?","response":"The primary benefit of vaulting payment methods within Zuora is gateway flexibility. It allows you to route payments to different gateways based on business rules without requiring the customer to re-enter payment details. However, teams should consider localization requirements when deciding on a vaulting strategy.","category":"comparison","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling B2C invoices in Canada that need to be in both English and French?","response":"The recommended approach is to capture the customer's language preference upfront and then assign a localized Communication Profile and Invoice Template based on that preference. This avoids the need to create complex, cluttered templates that attempt to display both languages simultaneously.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"How should contract PDFs be managed when integrating Zuora with a Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) system?","response":"The recommended best practice is for the upstream system (e.g., a webapp or CPQ) to store the generated contract PDF directly into the CLM system and simply create the subscription in Zuora. It is generally not efficient to attach the PDF to the Zuora subscription object solely for the purpose of archiving it to a CLM later.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integration"}
{"instruction":"Which data objects are available via Zuora Secure Data Share for Snowflake?","response":"The Secure Data Share typically includes Billing objects. Objects such as Revenue Schedule, Revenue Event, and Chart of Accounts are technically part of the Finance/Revenue domain within Zuora Billing and are available for sync, though some specific objects may require explicit opt-in configuration.","category":"definitional","topic":"Snowflake Connector"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer offer an annual commitment with monthly payments?","response":"This can be achieved using Payment Schedules. The subscription is configured with an annual term and annual charges (ensuring the commitment is recognized), while a Payment Schedule is set up to break the collection of that total amount into monthly installments.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing"}
{"instruction":"How should external payments (e.g., processed in SAP) store identifying information in Zuora?","response":"The best practice is to use a custom field on the Payment object to store the external transaction ID or reference number. While the `second_reference_id` field is an option, a dedicated custom field is often cleaner. Note that the standard `number` field on the Payment object typically cannot be overridden via API.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"Can Power BI connect directly to Zuora without a Data Warehouse?","response":"Power BI is a visualization tool that typically requires a database or data warehouse source. While it cannot connect \"directly\" to Zuora's transactional engine in the same way it connects to a SQL DB, customers can use a Zuora Data Warehouse Connector (e.g., for Snowflake or SQL Server) to stage the data, or export Zuora data (via Data Query) into a local database that Power BI can query.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Analytics"}
{"instruction":"Why does the Salesforce CPQ Connector force a cancel/rebook (debook/rebook) for amendments?","response":"Salesforce CPQ's architecture typically handles changes by adding new quote lines, whereas Zuora modifies existing subscriptions via versioning. To align these disparate models and ensure accurate proration and downstream ERP revenue recognition, the connector often utilizes a cancel/rebook methodology rather than a native amendment update.","category":"comparison","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer upgrade their Zuora 360 or Zuora Quotes managed packages in Salesforce?","response":"Customers can obtain the latest installation links by opening a support ticket or checking the relevant CPQ community channels. The upgrade involves appending the installation URL to their Salesforce environment domain. It is strongly recommended to test the upgrade in a sandbox environment first to ensure compatibility with existing customizations.","category":"procedural","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can performance issues with large quotes (e.g., >50 lines) be addressed in Zuora CPQ?","response":"Performance for large quotes can be improved by enabling the Asynchronous Order Call setting in Quote Studio. This offloads the processing load and prevents timeouts in the UI during the submission process.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"CPQ"}
{"instruction":"How can unbilled usage data be exposed to a customer portal?","response":"Unbilled usage can be retrieved by querying the `RatingResult` table via API or Data Source Export. You can filter by the `status` field (looking for \"rated\" but not yet \"billed\" items) to display current consumption to customers before an invoice is generated.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage"}
{"instruction":"How can discounts be applied sequentially (e.g., 20% off, then 10% off the remainder) rather than stacked?","response":"This logic can be handled using Discount Classes. By assigning discounts to different classes and defining the application order, you can ensure that subsequent discounts are applied to the net amount remaining after previous discounts, rather than summing the discount percentages.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Pricing"}
{"instruction":"Can the Data Warehouse Connector synchronization be forced manually?","response":"No, synchronization is automated based on the configured latency. Standard connectors typically sync every 12 or 24 hours. The Snowflake connector offers higher frequency options (up to every 5 minutes) for an additional cost, but manual triggering is not a standard feature.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Warehouse"}
{"instruction":"Why does a connector stop working if the user who configured it changes roles?","response":"Connectors often run using the authentication credentials of the user who initially authenticated them. If that user's permissions are downgraded or their account is deactivated, the connector will fail. Best practice is to create a dedicated Integration/System User with the necessary permissions and use those credentials to authenticate connectors.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Connectors"}
{"instruction":"What should be checked if Bill Runs are taking longer than reported in Grafana?","response":"If Bill Runs appear to be taking longer than the execution times shown in Grafana dashboards, check the Tax Connector Health or tax calculation process. Latency or timeouts from an external tax engine (e.g., Vertex, Sovos) can extend the total processing time significantly without always appearing as \"Bill Run\" processing time.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Performance"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between Multi-Org and Multi-Entity in Zuora?","response":"Multi-Org provides virtual data barriers within a single tenant instance, allowing for shared configurations like products and accounting periods. Multi-Entity establishes physical data barriers, effectively creating unique environments (tenants) that do not share configurations by default, though they can be linked in a hierarchy.","category":"comparison","topic":"Architecture"}
{"instruction":"Can a single Payment Schedule be associated with multiple invoices?","response":"Yes, it is possible to associate a single Payment Schedule with multiple invoices, but this functionality is currently supported only via the API and is not available in the UI.","category":"definitional","topic":"Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can e-signature be handled when using the HubSpot Connector?","response":"A common approach is to build a workflow in HubSpot that updates a specific field (like \"Customer Acceptance Date\") on the Deal object once the signature is collected.

{"instruction":"What is the recommended provisioning flow for services based on Zuora subscriptions?","response":"The recommended flow is: 1) Submit the subscription to Zuora. 2) Use a callout or workflow to notify the provisioning system. 3) Once the external system confirms provisioning is complete, trigger an update to activate the subscription in Zuora.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Provisioning"}
{"instruction":"How can customers check their current status of a Prepaid Drawdown balance?","response":"Customers can query the prepaid balance status using the `queryPrepaidBalanceFundByKey` API to see the current fund level, and `queryPrepaidBalanceTransactions` to view the history of usage against that fund.","category":"definitional","topic":"APIs"}
{"instruction":"Should the same Salesforce API user be used for both Zuora 360 Sync and Custom Workflows?","response":"No, it is best practice to use distinct API users for different integrations. This ensures clear audit trails and allows permissions to be scoped specifically to the needs of each integration (e.g., 360 Sync may require different access than a custom workflow).","category":"best_practice","topic":"Security"}
{"instruction":"Can a Central Sandbox (CSBX) refresh be configured to include only specific data?","response":"No, Central Sandbox refreshes are typically full copies of the Production environment's data and configuration. There is no native option to select a partial data set for the refresh.","category":"definitional","topic":"Environment Management"}
{"instruction":"What are good use cases for Zuora Custom Logic?","response":"Custom Logic is excellent for implementing data validation rules to prevent downstream errors. Examples include validating email formats, restricting special characters in text fields, or enforcing field character limits to ensure compatibility with ERPs like NetSuite.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Logic"}
{"instruction":"Is the Snowflake Secure Data Share connector included in Sandbox environments if licensed for Production?","response":"No, the Snowflake Secure Data Share connector is licensed per environment. Having it in Production does not automatically grant access in Sandbox; a separate license or provisioning is required due to the costs associated with the secure share.","category":"definitional","topic":"Snowflake Connector"}
{"instruction":"Why might Invoice FX (Foreign Exchange) data be missing from data source exports?","response":"If Invoice FX data is missing, check if the \"Reporting Currencies\" feature (T9 setting) is enabled for the tenant. This feature is often required to expose the relevant FX transaction tables for reporting.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"What is the data retention period for Grafana data (specifically API metrics), and why might queries return no results?","response":"The data retention period for Grafana (which runs off the Pinot database) is approximately 90 to 100 days. Users attempting to query metrics or API volume beyond this 100-day window will likely see no results returned.","category":"definitional","topic":"Grafana Data Retention"}
{"instruction":"Is there an upper limit to the number of records allowed in a Dynamic Pricing Decision Table?","response":"While there is no strict upper limit enforced by the system, successful testing has been conducted up to 1,000 rows with 10 attributes. Exceeding this number (specifically beyond 10,000 cells) may result in errors from ZRules. For tables of that size, it is recommended to reevaluate the complexity of the pricing model to simplify it.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Dynamic Pricing"}
{"instruction":"Does purchasing the Multi-Org (MO) entitlement for Billing automatically include or require Multi-Org for Revenue?","response":"No, Multi-Org (MO) for Billing does not necessitate MO for Revenue. They are technically and commercially different entitlements with distinct goals. A customer can have MO for Billing enabled without enabling it for Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"Which payment gateways currently support Giro or AvtaleGiro payment methods for Norway?","response":"Currently, these methods are not natively supported by most major gateways in Zuora.

{"instruction":"What are the performance benchmarks for Performance Booster Elite (PBE) regarding high-volume invoice generation?","response":"Benchmarks indicate PBE can process approximately 2 million invoices in 5 hours for simple subscriptions (1 subscription with 1 rate plan). Complex subscriptions will lower performance. For extremely high volumes (e.g., 20 million invoices), it is recommended to distribute the load (e.g., via anniversary billing) or spread the bill run over 2-3 days rather than attempting a single-day run.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Performance Booster Elite"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit to the number of payment gateway instances (e.g., multiple merchant IDs) that can be configured in a single Zuora tenant?","response":"Zuora typically gates the number of unique gateway types (e.g., Adyen vs. Stripe) based on the contract, not the number of specific instances. It is technically possible to configure a large number (up to thousands) of instances of the same gateway type (e.g., 150+ Adyen merchant IDs) within a single tenant.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"How do I install and configure the Zuora MCP server for use with LLM tools like Claude Desktop or Cursor?","response":"To install the Zuora MCP server: 1) Install the 'zuora-mcp' package using npm. 2) Configure your tool (e.g., edit the configuration file for Claude) to include the 'mcpServers' definition with your BASE_URL, ZUORA_CLIENT_ID, and ZUORA_CLIENT_SECRET. 3) Restart the application (ensuring the process is fully stopped via Activity Monitor if needed). The server works with tools supporting MCP integration but may require specific personal licenses for tools like ChatGPT.","category":"procedural","topic":"Developer Tools"}
{"instruction":"How can I obtain a definition of the Zuora tables and fields pushed to Snowflake to perform a fit-gap analysis?","response":"A recommended approach is to use a demo or OTR instance to display the data in Snowflake and simultaneously perform an export on the corresponding object in Zuora. Comparing these outputs allows for verification of field definitions and types.","category":"procedural","topic":"Snowflake Integration"}
{"instruction":"Why would the 'Credit Memo' data source be unavailable in Reporting for a user with full permissions?","response":"The 'Credit Memo' data source is only available if the tenant has Invoice Settlement (IS) enabled. If the customer is not on Invoice Settlement, there are no credit memos to report on, and the data source will not appear in the reporting interface.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"What does 'maintenance mode' mean for the Subscribe and Amend (S&A) APIs, and what is the recommended path forward?","response":"'Maintenance mode' means the feature is not End of Life (EOL) yet, but only critical, revenue-impacting defects with no workarounds will be fixed. New features will not be added to these APIs. The recommended path is to transition to Orders Harmonization to access newer features and modern APIs.","category":"definitional","topic":"API Lifecycle"}
{"instruction":"Can the 'Single Version Subscription' feature be enabled on a tenant that already has existing versioned subscriptions?","response":"No, currently the Single Version Subscription feature cannot be enabled for tenants with existing versioned subscriptions. It requires a clean environment. Support for existing tenants is targeted for a future release (estimated Q2-Q3 2026). To test this feature, you must request enablement in a clean sandbox via a support ticket.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"Are Payment Links, Payment Forms, and Payment Pages mutually exclusive, and are they all PCI compliant?","response":"No, they are not mutually exclusive; a customer can implement all three simultaneously for different use cases (e.g., Links for ad-hoc payments, Forms/Pages for sign-up flows). All three options are PCI compliant and secure.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payments"}

{"instruction":"Does sending mediation data to external targets (Amazon S3, Snowflake, Kafka) incur additional costs?","response":"Yes, using targets that take data out of Zuora's systems (like Customer's Kafka or Snowflake) will add to data transfer costs. While the base charge is typically based on the number of events ingested, data egress to external targets incurs additional fees and may require Engineering setup.","category":"definitional","topic":"Mediation"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for billing Professional Services (T&M vs. Milestone) in Zuora?","response":"For Time & Materials (T&M), the recommended approach is to use the Usage model (consumption billing) to track hours burned. For Milestone-based billing, using Order Line Items (OLI) or Invoice Schedules is often preferred. Note that Usage models may require custom fields or Prepaid Drawdown to capture upfront booking metrics properly in Revenue.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Professional Services Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can I verify if a customer is actively using Hosted Payment Method (HPM) pages?","response":"You can verify HPM usage by checking telemetry data (e.g., Grafana) for calls to the 'POST /v1/rsa-signatures' API. Successful execution of this API indicates the customer is generating the signatures required for HPM or Payment Form implementation.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"How should gateway options be configured for Ecommerce transactions versus Recurring transactions?","response":"The gateway should typically be set to 'Recurring' by default. For Ecommerce transactions, you must override the gateway options on the Order API to flag the transaction type explicitly (e.g., as 'Ecommerce') to ensure high authorization rates and correct processing.","category":"procedural","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"What is a recommended technical approach for implementing custom dunning logic (suspend/resume/cancel) in Zuora?","response":"A common best practice is to utilize the Workflow engine to run a batch job that retrieves all open, unprocessed invoices. The workflow sorts these invoices into aging buckets and triggers the appropriate actions (suspend, cancel, etc.) based on the age. A parallel workflow should handle 'cleanup' by identifying invoices that have been paid and resuming the account.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Dunning"}
{"instruction":"What changes were made to the permissions for the Events & Notifications API in the Q3 2025 release?","response":"For compliance and security, API calls for Events & Notifications (which were previously available to multiple roles) are now restricted by default to users with the Platform Admin role. Users without this role will encounter errors when attempting to modify these settings via API.","category":"definitional","topic":"Security"}
{"instruction":"How should orders containing both physical hardware and software subscriptions be handled?","response":"The recommended approach is to bifurcate the order upstream (e.g., at the POS or Order Management system). The hardware portion should be routed to the fulfillment system, while only the software subscription/warranty portion is sent to Zuora. Zuora does not typically handle the physical fulfillment logic for hardware.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Order Management"}
{"instruction":"How can I migrate a subscription in the middle of a billing period without generating a new invoice for the already-paid period?","response":"Use the 'Catch-up Bill Run' feature. Load the subscription with its original start date (or start of the last term). Then, execute a catch-up bill run targeting the *next* planned billing date. This sets the 'Billed Through Date' forward to that date without generating a Zuora invoice or requiring a credit memo for the historical period.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"What is the process for upgrading from the legacy Zuora 360 Sync to the new Zuora Connector for Salesforce?","response":"The migration process involves: 1) Requesting Support to enable the 'Object Enablement' page. 2) Navigating to Settings > Commerce > Sync Object Enablement and selecting the specific objects to sync (optimizing for only necessary objects to manage API load). 3) Submitting a support ticket to finalize the cutover. Be aware that the new sync is optimized for latency but may consume more SFDC API calls.","category":"procedural","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can a single customer account in Zuora support multiple currencies?","response":"Yes, using the 'Multiple Currencies' feature, a single account can hold subscriptions in different currencies. However, the account-level default currency cannot be changed once set. Enabling this requires careful consideration of downstream impacts on billing, payments, and reporting.","category":"definitional","topic":"Multi-Currency"}
{"instruction":"Are Payment Schedules compatible with the 'Multiple Currencies' feature?","response":"No, Payment Schedules are listed as a limitation when the 'Multiple Currencies' feature (allowing different currencies on a single account) is enabled. However, Payment Schedules are compatible with standard multi-currency usage where different accounts use different single currencies.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora offer a supported connector or managed package for Microsoft Dynamics 365?","response":"No, Zuora previously offered a connector but it has been rolled back and is no longer available. There is no official managed package for Microsoft Dynamics 365. Integration must be built via APIs or using a generic middleware solution.","category":"definitional","topic":"Integrations"}
{"instruction":"Can Amendments be processed using the Zuora Data Loader?","response":"Yes, Amendments are supported in Data Loader, though the specific Data Dictionary for them may not be visible by default and might need to be requested. Alternatively, users can use the Orders template within Data Loader to perform actions like adding products or charge overrides, which is often the recommended modern approach.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Loader"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended strategy for migrating Zuora CPQ configurations and metadata when splitting a Salesforce instance (e.g., divestiture)?","response":"There is no native 'clone and purge' functionality to move Zuora CPQ data between Salesforce production organizations. The recommended approach is to treat it like a new implementation or use Salesforce deployment tools (like Copado) to migrate configurations and metadata. Detailed data tagging is critical for migrating accounts and contacts correctly.","category":"best_practice","topic":"CPQ Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can issue-based revenue recognition be handled for Media customers (e.g., weekly issues, extra issues)?","response":"For issue-based revenue recognition, such as with weekly media publications, it is recommended to either upload a schedule of 'delivery dates' or utilize a consumption-based model. In this model, the delivery of the issue serves as the trigger for revenue recognition.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Issue-Based Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for handling large volume data extractions for BI3 Views if the API is too slow?","response":"For large volume extractions where the standard API is insufficient (e.g., exceeding 20 million lines or experiencing timeouts), it is recommended to use the BI3 extract COE program or leverage Zuora Secure Data Share (Snowflake) for more efficient data retrieval.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Data Extraction"}
{"instruction":"What are the benchmarks and recommendations for switching from SFTP to API for data ingestion?","response":"API provisioning is generally recommended over SFTP for modern integrations. The current benchmark for APIs is approximately 1 million transactions/lines per push. APIs support ingesting transactions with file iterations in parallel. For extremely high volumes, checking outbound limitations is also advised.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Integration Methods"}
{"instruction":"How can the Long Term/Short Term (LTST) reclassification journal be disabled?","response":"To stop the LTST reclassification, the specific job should be unscheduled or not run. However, users must ensure that the final reversal journal occurs if the process was previously in use. If the requirement is related to netting, that specific configuration may need to be disabled.","category":"Procedural","topic":"LTST Journal"}
{"instruction":"Does the K2 integration between Zuora Billing and Revenue support evergreen subscriptions?","response":"Yes, the K2 integration supports evergreen subscriptions, but with specific ground rules. Typically, this requires that no revenue allocation is performed and revenue recognition is based on billing (e.g., 'Upon Billing') to avoid complexities with Contractual Contract Value (CCV) calculations.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How is the Unit Sell Price calculated in Zuora Revenue?","response":"The Unit Sell Price is calculated using the formula: Extended Sell Price divided by Quantity divided by Term (Ext Sell Price / Qty / Term).","category":"Definitional","topic":"Formulas"}
{"instruction":"How can the 'Refresh Sandbox' menu be enabled in the Zuora Revenue UI?","response":"The 'Refresh Sandbox' menu is controlled by a specific profile option named 'Refresh Sandbox'. This profile must be enabled for the option to appear in the user interface.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox Management"}
{"instruction":"How does the Zuora Revenue to Workday connector handle journal balancing?","response":"Zuora Revenue ensures that journal entries are balanced (Total Debits equal Total Credits) before sending them. The Workday connector will not post unbalanced journals. The journals contain both Ledger Accounts and Revenue Categories (Worktags).","category":"Definitional","topic":"Workday Connector"}
{"instruction":"Why might a line be missing from the Waterfall Report even if it belongs to the selected period?","response":"A line may be excluded from the Waterfall Report if it has been fully amortized/recognized in a prior period and the system's profile setting for retaining fully amortized lines has caused it to drop off. Duplicate lines in the report can occur if multiple Revenue or Deferred segments exist for a single line.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Reporting Discrepancies"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora Revenue reports be triggered automatically by system events (e.g., data arrival)?","response":"No, there is currently no functionality to trigger reports based on system events or data arrival hooks. Reports must be run either ad-hoc or on a time-based schedule.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Report Scheduling"}
{"instruction":"How should Termination for Convenience (TFC) clauses be handled regarding revenue allocation?","response":"For contracts with TFC clauses (e.g., a 12-month contract cancellable after 3 months), best practice is often to limit the revenue allocation to the guaranteed term (e.g., the first 3 months). This can be managed by booking the initial guaranteed term and treating subsequent periods as renewals, though specific handling depends on auditor requirements.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Revenue Allocation"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit on the number of transaction lines in a Revenue Contract (RC)?","response":"There is no hard system limit on the number of lines in an RC, but performance issues (such as slow loading times when opening the RC in the Workbench) typically arise when an RC exceeds 500 to 1,000 lines.","category":"Definitional","topic":"System Limits"}
{"instruction":"Can a single Zuora Billing entity be mapped to multiple Zuora Revenue organizations?","response":"No, mapping a single Billing entity to multiple Revenue organizations is a custom requirement and not supported out-of-the-box. Doing so can create significant data gaps, such as issues with functional currency alignment.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Multi-Org Configuration"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'Before Validate' and 'Before Bundle Explode' stages in Data Augmentation?","response":"'Before Validate' runs data augmentation logic before the system performs validation on the source data. 'Before Bundle Explode' runs after validation is complete but before the bundle explosion process occurs; this stage is useful for copying attributes from a parent bundle line to its children to avoid duplication of effort.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Data Augmentation"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora Revenue support booking in one currency and invoicing in another for the same transaction?","response":"No, Zuora Revenue requires that the booking (sales order) and the billing (invoice) for a transaction be in the same transactional currency to ensure proper reconciliation and accounting.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Currency Support"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora Revenue support multiple reporting currencies within a single organization?","response":"No, Zuora Revenue does not support multiple reporting currencies within a single organization. It typically supports one functional currency and one reporting currency per organization.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Currency Support"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling subscription cancellations in Billing to ensure correct flow to Revenue?","response":"The best practice is to perform a Bill Run after the cancellation to generate the necessary credit memos or invoice reversals within Billing. This ensures the cancellation flows to Revenue as a transaction (e.g., CM-C) rather than relying on manual write-offs, which may not trigger the correct revenue reversal logic (CM-RO).","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Cancellations"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between Order to Revenue (OTR) and the K2 integration?","response":"K2 is the legacy integration framework between Zuora Billing and Revenue, which is no longer receiving new feature enhancements. Order to Revenue (OTR) is the current standard integration that supports newer features (like Attribute Based Pricing and Multi-Currency) and addresses gaps present in K2.","category":"Comparison","topic":"Integration Types"}
{"instruction":"Are General Ledger (GL) codes mandatory input fields for data loaded into Zuora Revenue?","response":"Yes, GL codes are typically mandatory inputs. They are usually captured upstream (e.g., in the Product Master or Order Lines) and passed in the input file to ensure that Zuora Revenue can generate the correct Journal Entry activity for the subledger.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Data Ingestion"}
{"instruction":"Does setting a revenue line amount to $0 reverse previously recognized revenue?","response":"Yes, if a line's amount is updated to $0 (e.g., via a cancellation or modification), the system will reverse the previously recognized contract revenue, even if the Performance Obligation (POB) template is set to 'Retain Amount'.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Revenue Reversal"}
{"instruction":"How should initial open balances be loaded via MJE during a migration?","response":"Initial open balances can be loaded via a Manual Journal Entry (MJE). The MJE should book the balance (typically to Deferred Revenue and a contra-Revenue account). If the balance already exists in the GL, users can select the option to 'Skip GL Transfer' for that specific MJE batch to avoid double-posting.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Is it advisable to use negative Selling Price (SSP) values in Zuora Revenue?","response":"No, using negative SSP values is not recommended as it can lead to irrational allocations where allocated values exceed the total contract value. $0 SSP is permitted, but negative values should be avoided.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"SSP Allocation"}

{"instruction":"Can Ramp Orders in Zuora Billing automatically trigger Ramp Revenue recognition in Revenue?","response":"Ramp Orders in Billing populate the Ramp ID and Deal Reference in the integration, but this does not automatically trigger ramp normalization in Revenue unless specifically configured. In Order to Revenue (OTR), the Ramp Deal Reference may not populate by default and might require Data Augmentation.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Ramp Revenue"}
{"instruction":"Does Attribute Based Pricing (ABP) work with the K2 integration?","response":"No, Attribute Based Pricing (ABP) is not supported out-of-the-box with the K2 integration because the K2 CCV service reads list prices from the static Product Catalog rather than the ABP data model. ABP is supported in the Order to Revenue (OTR) integration.","category":"Comparison","topic":"Feature Support"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'Period Name' filter work in the Waterfall Report?","response":"The 'Period Name' filter in the Waterfall Report selects data based on the Revenue Schedule. If revenue is scheduled to be recognized in the selected period, it will appear in the report, regardless of whether the Order Date or Start Date is in the past. 'Current Period' displays a snapshot of all future scheduled revenue as of that period close.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Reporting Logic"}
{"instruction":"Can a user undo an event file upload before processing?","response":"It is not possible to 'undo' or delete the file itself after upload. However, users can navigate to the Inbound > Unprocessed Events screen and delete the specific event records before they are processed by the system.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Data Management"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for the user account used to schedule background jobs?","response":"It is best practice to use a dedicated generic account (e.g., an IT or Admin group email) to schedule background jobs. This prevents jobs from failing or needing rescheduling if a specific employee leaves the organization and their user account is deactivated.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"System Administration"}
{"instruction":"Is there an automated process to delete data from the Revenue Line Staging table?","response":"No, there is no automated process to delete data from the Line Staging table. For small volumes, data can be deleted via the 'Manage Inbound' UI. For large volumes, an asynchronous process can be used if Unified Authentication (UA) is enabled, or a support ticket may be required.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Data Maintenance"}
{"instruction":"How are POB template version changes applied to existing Revenue Contracts?","response":"POB template versions are applied based on the Sales Order Date. Re-collecting an existing Sales Order line will not automatically apply a newer POB template version if the order date remains the same. The line generally retains the version active at the time of its initial collection.","category":"Definitional","topic":"POB Configuration"}
{"instruction":"Can Revenue Journals and MJEs be transferred in a single Accounting Batch?","response":"Yes, Zuora Revenue defaults to transferring GL Journals and MJEs in a single batch unless a filter is applied. For this to work effectively, the field mappings for both objects should be aligned.","category":"Definitional","topic":"GL Interface"}
{"instruction":"Is there a read-only mode for a Zuora Revenue tenant during maintenance or cutover?","response":"There is no single global switch to put a tenant into read-only mode. The recommended workaround is to bulk update user roles to remove write privileges (make them Read Only) during the maintenance window and revert the changes afterwards.","category":"Procedural","topic":"System Administration"}
{"instruction":"What is the row limit for BI View exports and the recommended alternative for larger datasets?","response":"Exports from BI Views are limited to approximately 20 million rows.

{"instruction":"What is the expected behavior when a subscription with 3 lines for 1 year has lines end-dated to the last day of month 1 in month 2, and new lines are added, with a prospective modification rule? Specifically regarding SSP behavior.","response":"In a scenario where a subscription has lines end-dated to the last day of the previous month (month 1) during month 2, and new lines are added with a prospective modification rule, the remaining SSP (Standalone Selling Price) should be calculated based on the Posted Percentage as of the end of the month. Even if the original lines are end-dated, the SSP for the remaining portion of the original line (that was presumably recognized) might be locked in or calculated based on the posted percentage, rather than being set to zero. This ensures the correct portion of the carve from the original allocation is retained.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"revenue_allocation"}
{"instruction":"Which mandatory subscription fields must be defaulted or included when supporting dual data sources (e.g., manual uploads, NetSuite, Oracle). Key fields typically include Subscription Name, Term, and RPC-related fields (Rate Plan Charge). It is also important to validate RPC Type fields; for example, if the upstream system sends null values, defaulting the RPC Type to 'One Time' (or the appropriate charge type) may be necessary to avoid errors like 'Amount Based Events is Not Supported only for Recurring charges'.","category":"best_practice","topic":"data_ingestion"}
{"instruction":"Why might a Custom Report layout not show data on the screen when 'Run Reports' is clicked, but generates successfully when using 'Submit Download'?","response":"If a Custom Report layout displays no data on-screen but works via 'Submit Download', it often indicates that the report was not built for UI display or that a specific data point is causing the on-screen rendering to fail (e.g., warping HTML elements). Checking the SQL logs with log level 2 can help identify where the failure occurs.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"reporting"}
{"instruction":"When unfreezing a Revenue Contract (RC) with 'Retain' as the option, why would the allocation eligible flag be set to 'N' and SSP group assignments disappear?","response":"If unfreezing an RC with 'Retain' results in the allocation eligible flag being set to 'N' and the loss of SSP group assignments, check the contract modification rules. This behavior has been observed when the unfreeze contract mod rule is set to 'Retro' (or 'Existing Alloc Treatment') on an RC that was in Retro mode. This may require raising a support ticket if no obvious customizations explain the behavior.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"contract_modification"}

{"instruction":"Why does an amount-based event upload fail with the error 'Amount Based Events is Not Supported only for Recurring charges' even when the transaction is not from Zuora Billing?","response":"This error can occur if the product validates against the source field value and the RPC Type is null or missing. Even for transactions from upstream systems (non-Zuora Billing), ensuring the RPC Type is explicitly populated (e.g., defaulted to 'One Time') can resolve this validation error. Additionally, verify that the event criteria (like SO Line Number/Charge Number + Version) matches an existing line; if the version is missing or criteria aren't met, the error message might be misleading.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"event_processing"}

{"instruction":"Why would the Extended SSP Value/SSP List Price of a recurring charge appear double the expected value when a fixed amount discount charge is associated with it in OTR?","response":"This issue can occur in OTR (Order to Revenue) when using Fixed Amount Discounts (FAD) on recurring charges, specifically if the FAD is set to 'Generate actual value in booking'. If the Parent Charge Number and Parent Charge Segment are populated correctly but the SSP sell/list prices are still incorrect (e.g., double), it may be a bug requiring a support ticket. A potential workaround to test is updating the RPC_MODEL of the fixed amount discount to 'Discount-Percentage', though this does not always resolve the issue.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"ssp_allocation"}
{"instruction":"How should a line with an incorrect order date (future dated due to a workflow issue) be corrected if the customer wants it collected in the current period?","response":"Data updates or corrections for upstream issues (like incorrect order dates) should be fixed in the upstream system (Billing), not directly in Revenue. Fixing only in Revenue causes reconciliation issues. The best practice is to debook/cancel the subscription upstream and create a new one with the correct details, or work with Billing support to update the data points, remove lines from the stage, and re-collect.","category":"best_practice","topic":"data_correction"}

{"instruction":"When using OTR, how are Revenue Schedules handled since user-defined schedules are not available?","response":"In OTR, user-defined schedules are generally replaced by standard POB (Performance Obligation) templates or manual upload of revenue/forecast schedules if needed. User-defined schedules are rarely used. For requirements like recognizing a specific % upfront and the rest ratably (e.g., a 2-year term with a termination clause), this is typically handled via POB configuration or manual overrides rather than the legacy user-defined schedule feature. through Level 1 allocation.","category":"definitional","topic":"revenue_allocation"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer resolve 'PARENT REFERENCE WAS NOT FOUND' or 'Credit memo amount is more than available invoice amount' errors for a Credit Memo in Zuora Revenue?","response":"These errors typically indicate data integrity issues where the Credit Memo cannot find its parent invoice or the amounts do not align (e.g., CM > Invoice). The resolution usually involves verifying the data upstream to ensure the parent invoice exists and has sufficient balance. If the error is valid (e.g., bad data entry), the transaction might need to be corrected or deleted from the stage if it hasn't been processed.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"data_validation"}
{"instruction":"In a multi-book environment, is it possible to direct specific data (e.g., based on a subsidiary) to only one book while sending all data to the primary book?","response":"Technically, if a Book ID is populated on the transaction, data will be pushed to that book alone; if blank, it goes to all books. However, since customers are typically charged for primary book volume, directing volume only to a secondary book might have commercial/contractual implications. For requirements like handling different subsidiaries in different books (e.g., one book for US, one for Israel), the standard approach is often to use one book and filter/segment the data downstream (e.g., when pushing to NetSuite) rather than splitting ingestion at the book level in Revenue.","category":"best_practice","topic":"multi_book"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'Pull' and 'Push' for data ingestion in K2 vs OTR?","response":"In K2, data is generally 'Pulled' (Zuora Revenue fetches data). In OTR, data is 'Pushed' (Billing pushes data to Revenue via events/actions). For other upstream systems, it is typically a 'Push' via API/SFTP.","category":"definitional","topic":"data_ingestion"}
{"instruction":"Can unbilled revenue be recognized through event uploads?","response":"Yes, unbilled revenue can be recognized through event uploads, provided the Sales Order (SO) has a value and the revenue release is based on an event (e.g., POB is event-based). For example, if SO is 20k, Invoice is 12k, and an event of 15k is uploaded, revenue to date will be 15k.","category":"procedural","topic":"revenue_recognition_rules"}
{"instruction":"Are there plans to build an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Zuora Revenue to enable AI agent interactions?","response":"There are no near-term plans to build an MCP server. The long-term vision involves first building the right AI models/LLMs and ensuring the necessary functional APIs and object models exist to support autonomous operations (like creating RC grouping templates or POBs via natural language).","category":"definitional","topic":"roadmap"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling negative invoice lines for adjustments (e.g., Professional Services credits) that fail to collect because the SO line is positive?","response":"For upstream adjustments to Professional Services or similar charges, the best practice is often to cancel and rebook (cancel the original and create a new correct line) rather than sending negative invoice lines against a positive SO line, which can cause collection failures or collection issues.","category":"best_practice","topic":"billing_adjustments"}
{"instruction":"What happens if a Credit Memo is modified upstream (e.g., booked on 5/27, changed on 5/28)? Does Revenue sync the update?","response":"Zuora Revenue typically does not accept updates to billing documents (Invoices/Credit Memos) once they are synced. The standard and recommended practice is to cancel the incorrect document and re-bill/re-issue a new one.","category":"best_practice","topic":"billing_adjustments"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora Revenue support data warehouse connectors other than Snowflake Secure Share?","response":"Currently, Zuora Revenue primarily supports Snowflake Secure Share for data warehousing. It does not have out-of-the-box connectors for other warehouses like Databricks or BigQuery in the same manner.","category":"definitional","topic":"integrations"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limitation on straight-lining ramps that decrease in value (step-down) over time?","response":"No, there is no specific limitation on straight-lining ramps that go down in value. As long as the ramp deal reference/identifiers are populated across the charges, the application should handle the straight-lining calculation.","category":"definitional","topic":"revenue_allocation"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer put conversion waterfalls on hold?","response":"Conversion waterfalls (transfer accounting) can be put on hold by loading/applying a hold using mass actions, or potentially by managing the collection/processing flags if caught early.","category":"procedural","topic":"holds"}
{"instruction":"Does the NetSuite connector support multi-book?","response":"Yes, the NetSuite GL connector supports multi-book environments (e.g., Pure Storage, 66 Degrees).","category":"definitional","topic":"integrations"}
{"instruction":"How should write-off recoveries (payments received after a write-off) be handled in Revenue?","response":"Payment application is generally not a Revenue function. If a write-off (Credit Memo) has already been processed in Revenue, and a payment is later received, the best practice is to handle the reversal/adjustment in Billing (e.g., via a Debit Memo) but *exclude* that Debit Memo from Revenue to avoid double counting or messing up the already recognized/written-off revenue. Alternatively, an MJE (Manual Journal Entry) or adjustment in Revenue can be used if the system is closed.","category":"best_practice","topic":"payment_processing"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to ingest externally generated files (like reports) back into the Secure Share environment?","response":"No, Secure Share is for outbound data sharing (Zuora to Customer). You cannot ingest external files or reports back into the Secure Share environment.","category":"definitional","topic":"secure_share"}
{"instruction":"How can specific transactions (like test accounts) be skipped or excluded from sending to Revenue?","response":"Transactions can be excluded by: 1. Updating the 'Processed' flag to 'X' (or similar ignore status) in the Revenue stage tables to stop them from processing. 2. Using the 'Exclude from Revenue' flag/fields in Zuora Billing (e.g., `excludeItemBillingFromRevenueAccounting`) before the data is sent.","category":"procedural","topic":"data_exclusion"}
{"instruction":"Why might a usage event in the consumption stage table have a Processed flag 'R' but not release revenue?","response":"A Processed flag of 'R' in the daily consumption stage table usually indicates the record was ready or related to a line, but if revenue isn't releasing, check: 1. If the line has been fully collected. 2. If the POB template is correctly assigned (e.g., 'ZR Usage Amount Event'). 3. If the usage date falls within the open period and valid contract dates. 4. If the setup is K2 vs OTR (Advanced Consumption is OTR-native; K2 behavior can be inconsistent).","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"consumption_revenue"}
{"instruction":"Does the 'Contains' filter operator in reporting support multiple values?","response":"No, the 'Contains' filter generally does not support multiple values. The 'In' operator should be used for multiple values.","category":"procedural","topic":"reporting"}
{"instruction":"How is foreign currency translation handled for booking-based revenue recognition?","response":"For booking-based revenue, if booking revenue exceeds the billed amount, it typically uses the exchange rate from the Sales Order (SO). When the actual billing occurs, the system reverses the SO-based revenue and re-recognizes it at the Invoice exchange rate (or adjusts the CL/Unbilled AR accordingly).","category":"definitional","topic":"multi_currency"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to track report usage (who runs what report and when)?","response":"Yes, internal queries on the `rpro_schd_prog_g` and related tables can track report usage (submit history). For example, a query joining `rpro_rep_schd_g`, `rpro_rep_g`, and `rpro_schd_prog_g` can list job IDs, report names, users, and run times. This data is not typically exposed in a standard UI report but can be queried via Data Query Utility.","category":"procedural","topic":"system_administration"}
{"instruction":"Does the 'Pending Activation' status enhancement apply to K2 customers?","response":"No, the 'Pending Activation' status enhancement is supported only for OTR (Order to Revenue), not K2.","category":"definitional","topic":"subscription_lifecycle"}
{"instruction":"Is there an additional cost for BI Views?","response":"No, BI Views are out-of-the-box (OOTB) and do not have an additional cost.","category":"definitional","topic":"licensing"}
{"instruction":"Can a bundle split be calculated based on duration (start/end dates) rather than a static percentage?","response":"Ideally, SSP/Grouping stratifications should be static. While bundle splits based on duration have been implemented (e.g., for BMC) by uploading split files for each term or using attributes, this approach faces challenges with amendments (renewals, proration). The system doesn't natively calculate dynamic duration-based splits OOTB without custom handling or specific attribute configurations.","category":"best_practice","topic":"bundling"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'ENABLE_ONE_TIME_CREDIT_BACK' profile required for OTR?","response":"This profile is generally considered obsolete or not prioritized for OTR, as OTR handles credit backs and one-time charges differently than K2.","category":"definitional","topic":"profiles_settings"}
{"instruction":"When refreshing a Billing Sandbox from Production, what snapshot time is used?","response":"The snapshot is taken at the same time the refresh is initiated.","category":"definitional","topic":"environment_management"}
{"instruction":"Is the Consumption Revenue module free for all customers?","response":"The Consumption module is now generally included (free) for new deals, but for existing customers, it typically requires an amendment or order form update to enable it. It should be scoped with the Client Manager/SDM before enabling.","category":"definitional","topic":"licensing"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR have an auto-collect profile?","response":"No, there is no 'auto-collect' profile in OTR. Data collection is triggered by scheduling the Data Collection job or by file uploads.","category":"definitional","topic":"data_collection"}
{"instruction":"Is Invoice Settlement Harmonization (ISH) supported on K2?","response":"No, ISH is not supported on K2; it is supported only on OTR.","category":"definitional","topic":"integrations"}
{"instruction":"Can Billed Revenue Start/End dates be displayed on the Waterfall tab of the Workbench?","response":"Currently, the Waterfall tab in the Workbench defaults to showing Revenue Contract (Order) dates. Displaying Billed Revenue specific start/end dates on the Waterfall tab is not standard functionality and would likely require an enhancement or viewing the Billed Revenue Waterfall report separately.","category":"definitional","topic":"ui_features"}
{"instruction":"Do standalone invoices flow automatically into Revenue in OTR?","response":"Yes, in OTR, standalone invoices flow into Revenue upon posting in Billing, provided they are not excluded.","category":"definitional","topic":"data_ingestion"}
{"instruction":"When is the 'Revision Period' date used for SSP derivation?","response":"Using the Revision Period date to derive SSP during a modification is rare. The best practice and most common approach is to use 'Line SO Book Date' or 'Line Level SSP Date' to ensure consistency and simplify reconciliation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"ssp_allocation"}
{"instruction":"Can we configure alerts for Job success/failure in Revenue?","response":"Yes, alerts can be configured for job statuses. You can select to receive notifications only for failed jobs in the configuration.","category":"procedural","topic":"system_administration"}

{"instruction":"What is required in RevPro if a customer changes their fiscal year end (e.g., June 30 to Sept 30)?","response":"If only the year-end is changing (but fiscal periods remain calendar months), the accounting calendar needs to be updated. A full summarization rerun is required to correct YTD (Year-To-Date) reporting buckets.","category":"procedural","topic":"accounting_calendar"}
{"instruction":"Can a closed period be reopened in a Sandbox environment for testing?","response":"There is no standard feature or script to simply 'reopen' a closed period in Sandbox. Adjustments should generally be made in the current open period. Re-opening periods is a complex data intervention that is not standard self-service.","category":"procedural","topic":"period_close"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit on the number of self-service refreshes for a Revenue Sandbox?","response":"Currently, there is no strict limit on the number of refreshes for a Revenue Sandbox from Production.","category":"definitional","topic":"environment_management"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'MULTI_CURR_FV_REPORT_LEVEL' profile affect allocation currency?","response":"When set to 'Reporting Currency', allocation is performed in the reporting currency. However, if set to 'Lowest Common Currency', and all lines match the functional currency, it allocates in functional. This profile determines the currency level at which FV (Fair Value) allocation logic is applied when transaction currencies differ.","category":"definitional","topic":"multi_currency"}
{"instruction":"Are there specific fields to exclude items from Revenue Accounting in the Order API?","response":"It appears to be enabled by default and non-editable for some customers in Production. If it needs to be disabled, a support ticket is likely required.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"profiles_settings"}
{"instruction":"Can the Waterfall Transfer job be decoupled from the Period Close process to run multiple times throughout the period for mid-period ARR reporting?","response":"Yes, the Transfer Accounting job (which preps the GL) can be run as many times as needed throughout the period. However, there are implications to consider: running it mid-period may capture contract modifications that trigger reversals and rebooking, and certain data points such as the GL date may change. It is not a blocker, but the user must understand these potential data shifts.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Transfer Accounting Job"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for mass updating customer names in Zuora Revenue, for example in the case of an acquisition?","response":"Mass actions on labels do not work for Customer Name because that field is used to determine workbench header information. The recommended options are: (1) Repush transactions from upstream (e.g., Workday) into Zuora Revenue, which may require contract updates or integration changes; or (2) A backend update. The Mass Action feature cannot currently be enabled for Customer Name.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Customer Name Update"}
{"instruction":"How can we change the GL outbound file extension from .ZIP to .CSV?","response":"To change the extension, you can disable the profile option `COMPRESS_XFER_REP_FILE_OUTPUT` or adjust the report layout configuration. If using SFTP to transfer files, you must also raise a TOPS ticket to configure the SFTP side to accept/expect the uncompressed file. If using APIs to transfer, disabling the profile option should suffice.","category":"procedural","topic":"GL Outbound File"}
{"instruction":"Under what conditions should a customer move to a dedicated shard, and does it guarantee better performance?","response":"Customers with high volume, requiring faster processing or quicker closes, benefit from a dedicated shard. Shared shards can degrade performance for such customers. Moving to a dedicated shard typically improves performance, provided the infrastructure (CPUs, threads, I/O, consumers) is sized correctly for the volume; if volume exceeds the provisioned infra, it may still need scaling.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Dedicated Shard"}
{"instruction":"What does the 'T Ttl Rev Prior Qtr CL' column in the Prior Period CA/CL report represent, and does it include MJEs?","response":"This column represents the Prior Quarter Contract Liability (CL) revenue in the transaction currency. It does include Manual Journal Entries (MJEs), but they are not shown separately.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prior Period CA/CL Report"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to change the CV Eligible flag to 'N' after the FV analysis has run to bypass SSP?","response":"No, Data Augmentation (DA) rules typically run at the pre-stage or line-stage. Changing the CV Eligible flag to 'Y' or 'N' after the Fair Value (FV) analysis stage will not trigger the system to re-derive or bypass SSP as expected, because the derivation happens earlier in the processing sequence.","category":"procedural","topic":"SSP Price / CV Flag"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'Resubmit' type work in report scheduling, and is there an option for detailed incremental Transfer Accounting reports?","response":"In report scheduling, 'From the Completion of Prior run' waits for the current run to finish before starting the next, while 'From the start of the prior run' does not wait. regarding Transfer Accounting (TA), the standard outbound report is a summary. There is no native option to schedule a detailed incremental TA report; the Accounting Report typically requires a full monthly run.","category":"procedural","topic":"Report Scheduling"}
{"instruction":"What is the impact on Zuora Revenue if a K2 customer moves to a Multi-Org structure in Billing?","response":"If Revenue is configured as non-multi-org and the customer does not intend to enable multi-org in Revenue, they must map the Billing Org to the default Revenue Org in the OTR settings. If they wish to enable multi-org in Revenue (supported for K2), it requires mapping and profile changes. A GS engagement is recommended if the customer cannot manage the profile changes and end-to-end testing themselves.","category":"procedural","topic":"Multi-Org Setup"}
{"instruction":"Does Manual Linking allow for prospective allocation, or does it default to retrospective?","response":"Manual Linking specifically allows for prospective allocation. However, if the Revenue Contract (RC) is already in a retrospective state (e.g., if it was delinked and then re-linked), it will remain retrospective.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Manual Link Allocation"}
{"instruction":"Why are objects like RCRF, Netting, and Accounting Summary missing from the standard Object Dictionary?","response":"These are views derived from other objects rather than direct tables, so they are not listed in the standard dictionary. Their definitions can be viewed in Secure Share (Snowflake).","category":"definitional","topic":"Object Dictionary"}
{"instruction":"Can a single Revenue Contract support a change in functional currency (e.g., from USD to INR) midway through its term?","response":"No, it is not possible to have multiple functional currencies in a single Revenue Contract. The recommended approach is to cancel the existing transactions and migrate them to a new entity/contract with the new currency. Data fixes to force this are not recommended due to auditability concerns.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Functional Currency Change"}
{"instruction":"Does the 'RPO' (Remaining Performance Obligation) report include contracts that are on hold?","response":"RPO is calculated based on revenue schedules. If the hold prevents schedules from generating or being considered valid, they may not appear, but generally, hold indicators exist. The consensus is that RPO relies on the existence of revenue schedules.","category":"definitional","topic":"RPO Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Does the system consider unreleased deferred balances in the Long Term/Short Term (LT/ST) calculation?","response":"No, the system does not include forecast data in the LT/ST calculation. It only considers the billed released portion (Short Term Deferred) if an invoice exists.","category":"definitional","topic":"LTST Calculation"}
{"instruction":"Can we perform SSP allocations at the POB level (e.g., carve out amounts from a SaaS POB to reallocate to Services)?","response":"No, Zuora Revenue currently supports SSP allocation at the line level. Assessing whether a SaaS item falls within the SSP range at the POB level to prevent allocations is not supported out-of-the-box.","category":"definitional","topic":"SSP Calculation"}
{"instruction":"Why are forecast schedules not generating during the data collection process in UAT?","response":"Forecast schedules update during data collection only for the contracts touched by that collection. For other contracts, the Forecast Master Job must be run. Ensure the `ENABLE_FORECAST` profile is enabled. In some versions, you may need to set the `Forecast RTP enabled` profile to 'N'.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Forecast Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Are amount-based bundle splits or dynamic bundling supported?","response":"Fixed-price type bundle splits are supported. However, dynamic bundling (changing bundle composition on the fly) is not supported.","category":"definitional","topic":"Bundle Splits"}
{"instruction":"Can we use `TA_BATCH_SIZE` to split Transfer Accounting files into smaller chunks (e.g., 2k lines)?","response":"No, `TA_BATCH_SIZE` controls internal processing threads, not file splitting. File splitting is available for specific connectors (like NetSuite) but not for generic GL CSV extracts. For generic extracts, splitting must be handled by middleware or customization.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Transfer Accounting Batch Size"}
{"instruction":"Can users update fields like Amount or Cancel Flag via the UI instead of using an SO Update?","response":"It is generally not recommended or allowed for Amount/Price fields because changes must trigger allocations, which the UI update may not properly initiate. Similarly, updating the Cancel Flag to 'Y' via UI may not trigger necessary downstream actions.","category":"best_practice","topic":"UI Field Updates"}
{"instruction":"What is the processing sequence between Stage Validation and Bundle Explosion?","response":"Bundle explosion happens first, followed by stage validation on all lines (including the newly split bundle lines).","category":"definitional","topic":"Processing Sequence"}
{"instruction":"What are the best practices for Linking/Delinking, and does it trigger summarization automatically?","response":"Before delinking, ensure revenue is deferred and the Revenue Contract (RC) is unfrozen. Summarization is automated internally, so you do not need to manually trigger it for reports or the Close Process Dashboard (CPD). If an upsell line comes in for a delinked RC, it will typically form a new RC rather than joining the delinked one.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Link/Delink"}
{"instruction":"Is there a performance concern with having a high number of GL segments (e.g., 12-45)?","response":"Generally, no. Customers with ~32 segments and volumes of 1,200 to 20,000 journal entries per run operate successfully, though performance tuning may be required for very high volumes.","category":"best_practice","topic":"GL Granularity"}
{"instruction":"Is Ramp Allocation supported for usage charges?","response":"No, usage charges are not supported in Ramp Allocation. This is a known system limitation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Ramp Functionality"}
{"instruction":"Can we trigger Contract Impairment Type 5 (Retrospective) in an OTR environment?","response":"Retrospective impairment (Type 5) generally does not produce an impairment amount because the retrospective allocation reshuffles the Total Contract Value (TCV) across all lines. While it may work with manual RORD uploads, it often does not trigger as expected in OTR flows due to this behavior.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Contract Impairment"}
{"instruction":"What is involved in changing a fiscal calendar (e.g., from Jan-Dec to Feb-Jan) for an existing customer?","response":"Changing the fiscal calendar for an existing customer is complex and treated as a mini-project requiring Global Services (GS) and COE. It involves custom patching and has a wide impact. A potential strategy is creating a 13-month transition year rather than using a stub period, but backdating changes is difficult.","category":"procedural","topic":"Fiscal Calendar Change"}

{"instruction":"How can we exclude lines with a value less than $10,000 from SSP analysis?","response":"You can add a filter in the SSP Analyzer for 'Ext Sell Price > 10000'. Ensure the field you are filtering on is included in the current view.","category":"procedural","topic":"SSP Analyzer"}
{"instruction":"Is there a standard report or script to generate a Historical Waterfall?","response":"The Waterfall is a snapshot in time; the system does not persist deleted snapshots to recreate history. A historical waterfall can be built using BI view schedules if the data has been exported to a data warehouse, but it is not available as a standard retroactive report within the application.","category":"definitional","topic":"Historical Waterfall"}
{"instruction":"Can we upload a custom file to Zuora Revenue via API?","response":"Yes, you can use the `POST_UploadFile` API. You must provide the name of the template in the API request headers.","category":"procedural","topic":"API File Upload"}
{"instruction":"If multiple contract modifications occur in a period, can we force 'Prospective' treatment if one of them triggers 'Retrospective'?","response":"No, if any modification in the period triggers Retrospective treatment (e.g., a term change or price reduction that reduces recognized revenue), Retrospective treatment will prevail for the contract in that period.","category":"definitional","topic":"Contract Modification Treatment"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle missing invoices from a prior fiscal year that need to be processed now?","response":"In Zuora Revenue, the invoice period corresponds to the month the data is processed. It is recommended to process these as catch-up transactions in the current period to avoid reopening closed periods, which can cause reconciliation and audit issues.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Prior Period Invoices"}
{"instruction":"How can we report on the difference in functional deferred balances caused by FX rate differences between Invoice and Credit Memo?","response":"There is no out-of-the-box report for comparing FX differences between Invoices and Credit Memos. The Unbilled FX report compares Sales Order vs. Invoice rates. Zuora Revenue generally expects upstream systems to handle FX gain/loss matching.","category":"definitional","topic":"FX Reporting"}

{"instruction":"Why does the sandbox self-refresh process stick at 99% for a long time?","response":"This is normal behavior. The process reaches 99% after data copy, but index creation occurs at the end. Index creation is a time-consuming task that does not update the percentage progress bar, making it appear stuck.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"How can we prevent double revenue recognition if the Usage Master Process is run twice simultaneously?","response":"You can enable the 'Incompatible with All' setting for the Usage Master Process in the Background Jobs configuration. This will prevent concurrent executions. This feature is expected to be available in an upcoming release.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Master Process"}
{"instruction":"Does the Audit Trail report capture new configuration additions (e.g., new DA rules)?","response":"Currently, the Audit Trail report only captures updates and deletions. An enhancement (ZR-43500) has been logged to include insertions (new records) in the report.","category":"informational","topic":"Audit Trail"}
{"instruction":"Why is a $0 sell price line with a carve-in amount not releasing revenue upon event upload?","response":"A $0 line should still release revenue if it has an allocated amount.

{"instruction":"How can I implement Swiss QR Bills on Zuora invoices?","response":"Swiss QR bills can be implemented using the HTML Invoice Template features. You can embed a JavaScript library (such as `kjua.min.js`) within the HTML template to generate the specific QR code required. Note that standard Zuora barcode merge fields generally do not support the specific characters or format required for Swiss QR specifications, so the JavaScript approach is the recommended best practice. The QR code encodes payment details (IBAN, reference, amount) to be scanned by banking apps.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Swiss QR Bill"}
{"instruction":"How long does an invoice generated by an Invoice Schedule remain in 'Draft' status?","response":"An invoice generated via an Invoice Schedule will remain in 'Draft' status indefinitely until it is explicitly posted. It can be posted manually via the UI, or automatically using a Workflow or API call. There is no automatic expiration or cancellation of these draft invoices.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to generate a preview of invoice data (e.g., for a Bill Run) without creating the actual Invoice objects in the database?","response":"Yes, you can use the 'Billing Preview Run' functionality. This can be executed via the API or a Workflow task. It generates the billing data (available as a CSV or queryable table) allowing you to see what would be invoiced without creating the legal Invoice records or incrementing invoice numbers.","category":"how_to","topic":"Billing Preview"}
{"instruction":"When will the 'Custom Logic' feature be Generally Available (GA)?","response":"As of late 2024, the target for General Availability (GA) of Custom Logic is February 2025. It is currently in Early Adopter (EA) phase. Entitlements (number of allowed definitions) will likely vary by Zuora edition (e.g., 5, 10, or 20 definitions).","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom Logic"}
{"instruction":"What is the impact of updating the Chart of Accounts (COA) on existing transactions?","response":"Updating the Chart of Accounts (COA) or accounting codes in Zuora settings does not retroactively update existing transactions (neither Draft nor Posted). The new settings will only apply to future transactions generated after the change. For this reason, it is best practice to perform COA updates after an accounting period close.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Finance/GL"}
{"instruction":"Can Payment Profiles and the legacy Advanced Payment Manager (APM) feature run simultaneously during a migration?","response":"Running both simultaneously is not recommended by Product as it has not been fully tested and may lead to conflicts. Specifically, APM typically requires the account-level `autoPay` flag to be `false`, whereas Payment Profiles often expects `true`. Additionally, payment runs with Payment Profiles enabled might bypass certain legacy autopay checks.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payment Profiles"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit to the number of Organizations (Orgs) allowed in a Multi-Org tenant?","response":"There is no hard physical limit documented, but there are practical limits regarding manageability (e.g., switching contexts in the UI, managing close processes for each org). A setup with around 30 Orgs is known to be supported and functional.","category":"definitional","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended way to delete billing transactions (invoices, payments) in a Production environment?","response":"You should never delete transactions in a Production environment. Best practice is to remove the 'Delete' permission from all user roles in Production. Instead of deletion, use reversal transactions such as Credit Memos, Debit Memos, or Refunds to correct balances and maintain a proper audit trail.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Integrity"}
{"instruction":"How can I prevent the generation or posting of $0 invoices?","response":"Zuora Billing generally requires an invoice to be generated to update the 'Charged Through Date' of the subscriptions, even if the amount is $0. To prevent sending these to customers, you can configure the Bill Run to generate invoices in 'Draft' status, and then use a Workflow to identify $0 invoices, cancel them (or leave them as draft/posted without emailing), and post the positive value invoices.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"Why am I receiving 'Operation failed due to lock competition' errors when calling unpost/cancel APIs?","response":"This error occurs when multiple concurrent processes attempt to update the same object (e.g., Account or Invoice) simultaneously. This often happens if you are making rapid API calls to unpost and then immediately cancel an invoice, as tax calculation or other background processes may still be holding a lock. To resolve this, ensure serial processing for operations on the same entity or introduce delays/retries.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"API Concurrency"}
{"instruction":"Why is the `paymentTerm` field missing from the response when querying the Invoice object via API?","response":"The `paymentTerm` field on the Invoice object is only populated if the invoice has a specific payment term that overrides the Account level term. If it is null, the invoice inherits the Account's payment term. To get the effective payment term in a query, you should select `paymentTerm` from the Invoice and also expand the Account object to select `account.paymentTerm` as a fallback.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"API/Data Query"}
{"instruction":"Is there an API to retrieve a list of all Reports defined in a Zuora tenant?","response":"Yes, you can use the Reporting API endpoint: `GET /reporting/api/rest/v1/reports/search?query=%` to retrieve a list of all report definitions.","category":"how_to","topic":"Reporting API"}
{"instruction":"How do I configure a subscription that invoices for a specific number of 'issues' (e.g., magazines) and then converts to time-based billing?","response":"A recommended approach is to use a Prepaid with Drawdown charge model for the 'issues' (setting the validity period to 1 year or similar). You can then use Workflow to monitor the balance; when the prepaid balance reaches zero, the Workflow can trigger an Order to add a new time-based Rate Plan and remove the prepaid plan.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Charge Models"}
{"instruction":"How can I handle seasonal billing where a customer does not pay during specific months (e.g., winter) but the contract remains active?","response":"Do not use the 'Suspend' subscription action, as this stops billing generation entirely and may not reflect the contract state correctly in all metrics. Instead, use an Amendment (or Order Action) to apply a discount (e.g., 100% or reduced rate) for the specific seasonal months. This keeps the subscription active and generating invoices (at $0 or reduced value) for the seasonal period.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Seasonal Billing"}
{"instruction":"Does the NetSuite Connector support Zuora Multi-Entity?","response":"Yes, but it requires a separate connector instance configuration for each Zuora Entity. You cannot manage multiple Zuora entities with a single NetSuite Connector instance.","category":"integration","topic":"NetSuite Connector"}
{"instruction":"How can I specify the processing order of multiple discounts (e.g., applying a Rate Plan discount before a Subscription level discount)?","response":"You can control the order of discount application by using 'Discount Classes'. Assign different classes to your discounts and define the application hierarchy in your tenant settings.","category":"how_to","topic":"Discounts"}
{"instruction":"How can I link Scheduled Orders to their Subscriptions in Data Query?","response":"The relationship is stored in the `OrderAction` table. You can join `Order` to `OrderAction` and then to `Subscription`. Note that a Scheduled Order might not link to a specific subscription version until it has actually executed.","category":"how_to","topic":"Data Query"}
{"instruction":"Can Order Line Items (OLI) be invoiced separately from Subscriptions?","response":"Yes. You can control this via the Billing Rule 'Allow to consolidate subscriptions, order line items and standalone invoice items...'. If you need granular control to separate them, you can also use the `InvoiceGroupNumber` field on the items to force them into different invoices.","category":"how_to","topic":"Order Line Items"}
{"instruction":"I am unable to load more than 50 records into a Custom Object using Data Loader. What is the solution?","response":"If Data Loader is failing for bulk Custom Object imports, try using the native CSV Import feature found directly on the Custom Object definition page in the Zuora UI. This uses the Bulk API backend and is often more robust for larger datasets than the standard Data Loader tool.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Loader"}
{"instruction":"Are Invoice Schedules supported for Evergreen subscriptions?","response":"No, Invoice Schedules are not supported for Evergreen subscriptions. They require a defined Total Contract Value (TCB) or fixed term to generate the schedule, which Evergreen subscriptions do not have.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Schedules"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the Payment Method on a Subscription via API if the 'update subscription' call doesn't support it?","response":"You should use the Payment Profiles API (`PUT /v1/payment-profile`) to manage payment method associations. Alternatively, you can update the default payment method on the Account level, which applies to all subscriptions that do not have a specific override.","category":"how_to","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"How can I create a custom field on a standard object (e.g., Account) via API?","response":"You can use the Settings API (specifically `POST /settings/definitions`) to create custom fields programmatically. This endpoint is documented in the Knowledge Center under 'Manage Custom Fields' rather than the main API reference.","category":"how_to","topic":"Settings API"}
{"instruction":"Can I enable Invoice Settlement Harmonization (ISH) on a tenant that does not have Orders enabled?","response":"No, Invoice Settlement Harmonization generally requires Orders (or Order Harmonization) to be enabled first. It is part of the modern billing stack that moves away from the legacy Subscribe & Amend and Invoice Item Adjustment models.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can I send different email notifications for Autopay vs Manual payments if I can't create duplicate notifications for the 'Payment Processed' event?","response":"Instead of creating duplicate notifications, use a single notification for the 'Payment Processed' event and use the `Payment.Source` field (e.g., filtering for 'PaymentRun') to distinguish autopay events. You can use advanced merge field conditionals (if/else logic) within the HTML email template to dynamically change the email content based on whether it was an autopay or manual payment.","category":"how_to","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"What should a customer do if they are currently on 'Order Harmonization' and want to move to 'Full Orders'?","response":"Since the 'Subscribe & Amend' model is being deprecated, customers on Order Harmonization (which supports both models) should transition to Full Orders. This typically involves disabling the 'Order and Subscription Co-existence' setting in the tenant to enforce the Orders UI and API behavior exclusively.","category":"strategy","topic":"Orders Migration"}
{"instruction":"Why does the 'Payment Term' on a posted invoice appear to change when I update the Account's payment term?","response":"This is a UI behavior. If the `PaymentTerm` field on the Invoice object is null, the Zuora UI dynamically displays the Account's current payment term. The actual data on the Invoice record has not changed. You can verify this by checking the invoice record via Data Query or API.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"UI Behavior"}
{"instruction":"Does the AQuA API support the 'IN' clause in ZOQL queries?","response":"No, standard AQuA ZOQL does not support the `IN (...)` operator. You must construct your query using `OR` conditions (e.g., `Status = 'Active' OR Status = 'Cancelled'`).","category":"limitations","topic":"AQuA API"}
{"instruction":"Can I repoint an existing Refund to a different Credit Memo?","response":"No. A refund is permanently linked to the Credit Memo (or Payment) from which it was created. To 'move' it, you must cancel the original refund and create a new refund linked to the correct object.","category":"how_to","topic":"Refunds"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora's out-of-the-box email server support DKIM?","response":"No, the default internal email server does not support DKIM. To use DKIM, you must configure the 'Advanced SMTP' server feature (which uses Amazon SES) or use an external SMTP server.","category":"technical","topic":"Email Deliverability"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between the 'Invoice Posted' and 'Invoice Posted (Custom Event)' notification events?","response":"'Invoice Posted' refers to the legacy, hardcoded notification event. 'Invoice Posted (Custom Event)' refers to the event trigger built on the newer Event Framework (Notifications 2.0), which offers more flexibility. In the new UI, standard events may also be labeled with their ID (e.g., '1110 - Invoice Posted').","category":"definitional","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Is there a public API to update Payment Gateway credentials (e.g., Client ID/Secret)?","response":"No, Zuora does not expose sensitive gateway credential fields via the public API for security reasons. These must be updated via the Zuora UI.","category":"limitations","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to report on Net MRR?","response":"The recommended approach is to use the `ChargeMetrics` table (which provides Net MRR per charge) or `OrderDeltaMrr` (which provides the change in MRR per order). Avoid using `RatePlanCharge.MRR` as it reflects gross MRR and does not account for discounts.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle Zuora 360/CRM Sync during a large data migration?","response":"It is best practice to disable the real-time sync during large data loads (e.g., >150k records) to prevent throttling and performance issues. You can do this by disabling the sync settings or by populating the `CRM ID` field with a dummy prefix during load (so the connector ignores them) and then updating/unmasking them later to sync.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can I group usage records by a custom field on an HTML invoice template?","response":"You can use the `GroupBy` filter in the merge field syntax within your HTML template. For example: `{{#InvoiceItems|FlatMap(ProcessedUsages)|GroupBy(Usage.CustomField__c)...}}`.","category":"how_to","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"Why are cancelled accounts not syncing to Salesforce via Zuora 360?","response":"By default, Zuora 360 may delete or stop syncing cancelled objects. To retain them, you must enable the specific tenant permission `CanceledAccountSync` (for legacy 360) or the equivalent Cauldron setting (for the new CRM connector).","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"Why do the monthly billed amounts vary for an Annual Charge using the 'Annual List Price' billing period?","response":"When using 'Annual List Price' based billing with monthly installments, Zuora calculates the monthly amount to ensure the total equals the annual price exactly. Due to rounding (e.g., 100 / 12 = 8.33...), some months may be adjusted by a penny (e.g., 8.34) to act as a 'true-up'. This is expected behavior.","category":"definitional","topic":"Billing Logic"}
{"instruction":"How can I migrate a Zuora-to-NetSuite integration to a new NetSuite instance for a large volume of data?","response":"Migrating a live integration for high volumes (e.g., 400k accounts) is high risk. The recommended approach is to batch the updates. Update the integration status fields (e.g., `NetSuite Integration Status`) in Zuora for a batch of records (e.g., 25k) to 'Error' or blank to trigger the connector to pick them up as 'new/updated', let the sync run, and then repeat for the next batch.","category":"best_practice","topic":"NetSuite Integration"}
{"instruction":"Is there a resource for configuring the new Salesforce CPQ Connector v2?","response":"Yes, there are setup guides and videos available (referenced internally as 'Salesforce CPQ Connector Install Guide and Testing Steps') that detail configuration and testing for the new v2 connector.","category":"resource","topic":"Salesforce CPQ Connector"}
{"instruction":"Can a customer change their tenant name on their own?","response":"A customer can update the display name (the banner name shown in the UI) themselves via the Tenant Profile Settings. However, changing the actual tenant name (used in OneID and backend systems) requires a support ticket.","category":"administrative","topic":"Tenant Management"}
{"instruction":"How can I update the Revenue GL fields on a Product Rate Plan Charge via API after an OTR (Order to Revenue) integration?","response":"You should use the PUT operation on the Product Rate Plan Charge object (/v1/object/product-rate-plan-charge/{id}). \n\nNote: The older PUT_RevProAccountingCodes API is considered legacy/deprecated in favor of the data backfill processes available in the UI or via API templates.","category":"technical","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to trigger an event or notification immediately when a new Invoice PDF is generated?","response":"No, Zuora does not currently support a real-time event trigger specifically for the generation of an invoice PDF file. \n\nWorkaround: You can implement an asynchronous solution using a Workflow that runs a Data Query periodically (e.g., hourly). The query should target the InvoiceHistory object to identify records indicating PDF generation or regeneration, and then trigger the desired downstream notification.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"How can we handle statutory reporting in a foreign currency (e.g., GBP) for a US-based entity whose home currency is USD?","response":"Zuora's standard reporting is based on the tenant's Home Currency. \n\nOptions:\n1.  Multi-Org: If you have Multi-Org enabled, you can configure a secondary reporting currency.\n2.  External Reporting: For single-tenant/non-Multi-Org setups, you must handle this outside of Zuora. You can use Data Query to export the transaction data and apply FX conversion (convertfx function exists in DQ, but is limited) in an external Data Warehouse. Standard Trial Balance reports in Zuora cannot be generated in a non-home currency.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Reporting"}

{"instruction":"How do I convert an existing Invoice HTML Template into a Credit Memo Template?","response":"There is no direct \"convert\" button. You must export the Invoice Template JSON and manually find/replace specific terms before importing it as a new Credit Memo template.\n\nKey Replacements:\n*   Invoice → CreditMemo\n*   InvoiceItems → CreditMemoItems\n*   InvoiceDate → MemoDate\n*   InvoiceNumber → MemoNumber\n*   DueDate → MemoDate (usually)\n\nNote: Merge fields differ slightly, so validation errors during import usually indicate missed replacements.","category":"procedural","topic":"Templates"}
{"instruction":"How should I configure billing if a customer wants specific subscriptions to bill on specific days (e.g., the 17th and 20th), rather than using the Account's Billing Cycle Day?","response":"Do not rely on changing the Account's Billing Cycle Day (BCD) dynamically. Instead:\n\n1.  Charge Configuration: Configure the charges on the subscriptions to use Charge Trigger Day or Specific Day of Month (e.g., set the billing day to the 17th or 20th explicitly on the charge).\n2.  Bill Run: Schedule the Bill Run to run daily and select all Billing Cycle Days (or use a broad filter). \n\nThe Bill Run will evaluate the account daily but will only generate invoices for charges that are actually due based on their specific configuration.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can I trigger a notification based on a future date (e.g., Charge Effective Date)?","response":"You cannot use standard \"Custom Events\" to trigger on a future date because they fire immediately upon evaluation. \n\nSolution: Use Custom Scheduled Events. These check conditions daily and can trigger notifications relative to a date field (e.g., \"0 days before Charge Effective Date\"). \n\nUpdate: As of the 2025.Q1 release, a standard notification for Rate Plan Charge key dates is now available GA.","category":"technical","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"What data gets converted when enabling Invoice Settlement (IS) on a tenant?","response":"During the migration to Invoice Settlement:\n*   Negative Invoices and On-Account Credit Balance Adjustments (CBAs) are converted to Credit Memos.\n*   Payment/Refund Objects: PaymentApplication, PaymentPart, RefundApplication, and RefundPart records are created.\n*   Deprecated Objects: InvoicePayment and RefundInvoicePayment are deprecated in favor of the new application objects.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can I retrieve a list of all Report definitions and their Run History via API?","response":"You can use the Reporting REST API. Note that some endpoints may be undocumented or internal.\n\n1.  Report Definitions: GET /reporting/api/rest/v1/reports/search?query=%\n2.  Run History: POST /reporting/api/rest/v1/reportruns with payload {\"pagination\": {\"pageNo\": 0, \"pageSize\": 100}}. \n\nNote: This returns a CSV of run history.

{"instruction":"What is the best way to migrate tokenized payment methods from a gateway like Stripe or Chargebee to Zuora?","response":"The standard approach is to import them as CCReferenceTransaction payment methods. You can use the Generic Payment Method Loader to bulk import these tokens, mapping them to the customer accounts.","category":"procedural","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"Can Deployment Manager migrate Custom Reports that are based on Saved Data Queries?","response":"Yes, but with a critical dependency: You must migrate the Saved Data Query first. \n\nReports reference the Query ID.

{"instruction":"Does Zuora support detailed Journal Entries (per invoice/payment) sent to the ERP?","response":"Zuora's standard GL interface exports Summary** Journal Entries. \n\nWhile Zuora has underlying detailed objects (JournalEntryDetail), they are not fully exposed in Data Query or standard exports for direct ERP consumption. If a customer requires detailed JEs (often for regulatory reasons like the FEC file in France), the workaround is to build a custom Data Query report to extract transaction-level details and feed them to the ERP or external warehouse separately.","category":"definitional","topic":"Journal Entries"}
{"instruction":"How can I retrieve the current Net MRR at the subscription level using the Charge Metrics table in a Data Query, as my current query returns all previous versions?","response":"To retrieve the current Net MRR using the Charge Metrics table, ensure you filter for the currently active charge segments. You must include a filter for the charge metrics end date, specifically `cm.enddate >= current_date` (or a specific date). Additionally, filter for `s.islatestversion = true` and `rpc.islastsegment = true` to avoid summing previous versions.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Data Query Charge Metrics"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to report on invoice line items (specifically aggregating by product) in Zuora Analytics if the default data sets are non-summable?","response":"To achieve granular reporting by product in Zuora Analytics (when default data sets are non-summable), the recommended approach is to clone the default datasets in the Explorer Analytics dashboard and simply add the `Product Detail` field to the dataset. This allows for more granular results split by product.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Analytics Reporting"}
{"instruction":"How can the Vertex `taxAreaId` be mapped to a custom field in Zuora for downstream systems?","response":"The `taxAreaId` from Vertex is typically mapped to a custom field on the Contact object or the Product Rate Plan Charge.

It functions similarly to entitlements for custom objects and workflows.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Extension Studio Licensing"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to 'reset' an API Sandbox to a clean slate similar to a refresh?","response":"There is no 'reset' function for API Sandboxes comparable to a Central Sandbox refresh. The best workaround is to use Developer Tools (or APIs) to delete all Account objects, which will cascade delete children objects (subscriptions, invoices, etc.). This effectively clears the tenant data, although it is not a hard reset of configuration.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Sandbox Management"}
{"instruction":"How can I determine the maximum number of organizations allowed in a Multi-Org environment?","response":"You can view the limit in the Org Hierarchy Management settings under the 'Total Org Units Entitled' field. In Production, this is often set to 100, though Sandbox limits may be lower. Note that adding organizations adds overhead to processing (separate close and journal processes).","category":"Definitional","topic":"Multi-Org Limits"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to run a billing preview for a single customer to simulate a renewal invoice via API?","response":"Use the `POST /v1/operations/billing-preview` API. Avoid using `GenerateBillingDocuments` (unless you specifically need a PDF and plan to unpost/cancel the draft) or `PreviewOrder` (unless you need tax/order metrics specifically). The Billing Preview API is designed for this scenario.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Billing Preview API"}

{"instruction":"How can I link Journal Entry Items to transaction tables like Payment Applications or Invoice Items in Data Query?","response":"Data Query does not expose the `JournalEntryDetail` objects that contain the direct links. While `JournalEntry` links to `PaymentApplication`, `JournalEntryItem` does not directly link to `PaymentApplication`. You may need to rely on `ApplicationGroup` logic or use the summary level `JournalEntry` links, noting this is a known limitation in Data Query exposure.","category":"Technical","topic":"Data Query Joins"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected delay for Stripe India e-mandate activation?","response":"For recurring payments in India via Stripe, there is typically a ~26-hour delay for the mandate to become active to comply with e-mandate regulations (pre-debit notifications). Initial payments may remain in 'Processing' status during this window.","category":"Regional","topic":"Stripe India Payments"}
{"instruction":"How can we send a notification to a user when a Dev Tools job completes?","response":"Since Dev Tools does not send native email notifications, a workaround is to build a Workflow that queries for the expected data change (e.g., a specific field update on the last record) on a schedule and sends an email/text when the change is detected.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Dev Tools Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Does the 1000 amendment limit on Subscribe/Amend (S/A) apply to Orders?","response":"Yes, the limit is technically on the number of subscription versions (approx. 1000), not just amendments. Since Orders generate versions/amendments, the limit applies. Moving to Order Harmonization does not reset this count. The solution is to create a new subscription.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Subscription Limits"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement a Credit Card Surcharge fee flow?","response":"A common approach is to use a Workflow to calculate the surcharge fee, execute a payment, and potentially add a custom field for tracking. Alternatively, Custom Logic can be used.

{"instruction":"What determines if a usage record is picked up by an invoice?","response":"Usage records are invoiced indirectly via Usage Charges. The Usage Charge is picked up if the Bill Run Target Date is on or after the Charge End Date (for arrears/recurring). If the Target Date covers the period of the usage, and the rating period is closed/processed, the usage will be billed.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Usage Billing"}
{"instruction":"Can we avoid creating a separate Credit Memo for a return Order Line Item (OLI) and net it on the invoice?","response":"No, currently a return OLI will generate a separate Credit Memo. It cannot be netted directly on the invoice. This is a known request tracked by product.","category":"Limitation","topic":"Order Line Items"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to revert a Central Sandbox refresh?","response":"No, unless a specific backup schedule was arranged with Ops (which is not the default behavior), you cannot revert a sandbox refresh.","category":"Operations","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"Should we track Legal Entity segments at the Subscription level?","response":"It is strongly discouraged. Legal Entity should ideally be tracked at the Account level to ensure that downstream transactions (Invoices, Payments, etc.) remain within the correct entity and do not cross boundaries.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"GL Segmentation"}
{"instruction":"How can I update Product Rate Plan Charge tiers via API without knowing the Tier IDs?","response":"The QuickStart API handles this natively. Alternatively, the v1 `CRUD: Update a product rate plan charge` API can update charges and tiers without specifying Tier IDs if the payload is structured correctly with the tier data.","category":"API","topic":"Product Catalog Update"}
{"instruction":"Does a Central Sandbox refresh copy the Product Catalog?","response":"Yes, a Central Sandbox refresh includes a copy of the Product Catalog from production.","category":"Operations","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"Is there an API to regenerate an Invoice PDF?","response":"Yes, you can use the `PUT /v1/object/invoice/{id}` API with the field `RegenerateInvoicePDF` set to true. This is available via the Object API.","category":"API","topic":"Invoice PDF"}
{"instruction":"Why can't I segment Payment/Refund Journal Entries by Subscription fields?","response":"GL Segmentation rules typically link to Product or Account fields. Payments and Refunds do not natively join to Subscription fields in the GL segmentation engine, so you cannot segment JEs directly by subscription attributes.","category":"Configuration","topic":"GL Segmentation"}
{"instruction":"How can I track changes to the Bill Cycle Day (BCD) on an account?","response":"You can query the `auditobjectchangeevent` table where `objecttype = 'Account'` and `Attributeid = 'BillCycleDay'`.","category":"Reporting","topic":"Audit Trail"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for transitioning a customer to a new currency (e.g. Euro transition)?","response":"The standard approach is to recreate the account and subscription in the new currency. If Flexible Billing is enabled, you may only need to recreate the subscription with the new currency (Subscription level currency).","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Currency Conversion"}
{"instruction":"How can I handle upgrade/downgrade proration logic at the charge level?","response":"You can use Zuora Workflow to enforce specific proration rules by manipulating the charge trigger dates or applying override invoice rules. The 'ChangePlan' Order Action is another option, though it has limitations regarding Revenue Recognition integration.","category":"Configuration","topic":"Proration"}
{"instruction":"How can I include a future-dated Order Action (e.g., Add Product) in an email notification?","response":"You can use a merge field filter in the email template. For example: `{{#OrderAction.Subscription.RatePlans|FilterByValue(AmendmentType,EQ,NewProduct)}}` to target the specific rate plans added by the order.","category":"Templates","topic":"Email Merge Fields"}
{"instruction":"Why does a Central Sandbox refresh sometimes complete in 30 minutes?","response":"A short refresh time is normal if the source tenant (Production) has a relatively low volume of data.","category":"Operations","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"How can I implement HMAC authentication for S3 uploads in a Workflow?","response":"Implementing HMAC in Liquid is difficult due to newline/encoding issues. It is recommended to use a JavaScript task within the Workflow to construct the canonical request and generate the signature.","category":"Technical","topic":"Workflow S3 Integration"}
{"instruction":"What is the JSON format for the Trust.zuora.com webhook?","response":"The webhook sends a JSON payload consistent with StatusPage notifications, containing `page`, `incident` (with `name`, `status`, `affected_components`), and `meta` information.","category":"Technical","topic":"Trust Webhook"}
{"instruction":"Can I separate Workflow execution by Organization in a Multi-Org environment?","response":"Yes, if you execute a Workflow from a specific Org Unit (using the org selector or API header), it runs in the context of that organization, meaning API calls within the workflow will be scoped to that org.","category":"Multi-Org","topic":"Workflow Context"}
{"instruction":"Does Prepaid with Drawdown (PPDD) support Multi-Attribute Pricing (MAP)?","response":"It works for unit-based PPDD models. However, since MAP uses unbilled usage, you may not see overage/drawdown impacts until the bill run processes the usage at the end of the period. Currency-based PPDD with MAP is likely not supported.","category":"Configuration","topic":"Prepaid with Drawdown"}
{"instruction":"How can I bill a customer Weekly or Bi-Weekly if the Account BCD is different?","response":"You should configure the Billing Period on the Charge itself to be 'Weekly' or 'Bi-Weekly'. The Account BCD is primarily for alignment or batch filtering and does not dictate the frequency if the charge is defined otherwise.","category":"Configuration","topic":"Billing Frequency"}
{"instruction":"Does the Foreign Exchange Rates feature automatically update Product Catalog prices?","response":"No, the FX Rates feature is for converting transaction amounts (e.g., generating invoices in a different currency). Product Catalog prices are static and must be updated manually via UI or API for each currency.","category":"Definitional","topic":"FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"Where can I find documentation on field lengths for Zuora objects?","response":"Field lengths are documented in the API Reference (though sometimes scattered) and the older SOAP API Object Reference. There is no single unified document for all modern objects.","category":"Documentation","topic":"Field Definitions"}
{"instruction":"Can I display VAT in a different currency than the Invoice currency?","response":"This is a display-only requirement. You can store the FX rate on the invoice/account and use a custom invoice template to calculate and display the VAT in the local currency, but the invoice and posting in Zuora will remain in the invoice currency.","category":"Configuration","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"Which Zuora features are currently End of Life (EOL) or End of Support (EOS)?","response":"Collections is EOL. Features like Subscribe/Amend, Legacy AR objects (Credit Balance/Adjustments), and `overageRatedQuantity` are EOS. Certain Payments components and Platform features (Data Access Control, App Store Connectors) are also planned for EOS in 2025.","category":"Roadmap","topic":"EOL/EOS"}
{"instruction":"Why does the Bill Run Advanced Filter show a higher 'Total Accounts Processed' than expected?","response":"The 'Total Accounts Processed' count includes all accounts that were evaluated by the bill run, even if they were filtered out during the process (e.g., due to no usage or inactive status) and did not generate an invoice. This is expected behavior.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Bill Run"}
{"instruction":"What are the risks of using the standard Credit Card Fee Workflow?","response":"Risks include potential penalties from credit card networks (Visa/Mastercard) for non-compliant surcharging. Operationally, it relies on custom fields and works by canceling/recreating invoices, which can create noise in subscription history and audit logs.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Credit Card Fees"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'CreditCard' and 'CCRef' payment method types in Zuora?","response":"`CreditCard` type means Zuora stores the actual card details (vaulted). `CCRef` (Credit Card Reference) means Zuora stores a token or Customer ID (e.g., from Stripe) and does not hold the raw card data. Use `CCRef` for tokenized flows.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Payment Methods"}
{"instruction":"Why does Zuora return an error for an expired credit card even if the gateway might accept it?","response":"Zuora has a setting 'Validate credit card expiration date' that prevents payment method creation/usage if expired. However, even without this, gateways like Stripe typically reject expired cards. Some gateways (e.g., Orbital) might accept them, but Zuora's validation is often the first gate.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Validation"}
{"instruction":"How can I limit a company logo image uploaded to an HTML invoice template to appear only on the first page, given that I cannot use a URL?","response":"If the logo is an uploaded image rather than a URL reference, standard HTML/CSS in the template (like conditional logic based on page numbers) may not successfully restrict it to the first page because the image is embedded. A common workaround or requirement is to host the image externally and use a URL reference, which allows for better control via HTML/CSS visibility logic based on page numbering. Alternatively, check if the template structure allows for a specific 'First Page' header section distinct from subsequent pages.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle variances between invoices generated in Zuora (CUBR) and legacy system invoices during a migration?","response":"If invoicing parameters (Price x Quantity x Rate) are identical, variances should be immaterial (rounding). If variances exist, establish a threshold of acceptability. For differences within the threshold, perform a one-time cumulative adjustment. This can be done via an 'adjustment bill run' in Zuora Billing (creating standalone invoices or credits) using a custom field to identify the adjustment charge, which can then be mapped in Zuora Revenue to AR/Deferred or Deferred/Revenue as appropriate. Do not use this method for regular transactions.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Migration"}
{"instruction":"In Configurable Lockbox, if a bank file lacks an invoice number and comes in as an unapplied payment, can it be automatically applied to an invoice of the same amount?","response":"No, the lockbox feature itself does not support this 'smart' matching logic out of the box. To achieve this, you would need a Workflow (or external integration) to process the unapplied payments, find the matching invoice by amount, and apply the payment.","category":"procedural","topic":"Lockbox"}
{"instruction":"Is integration between Deployment Manager and GitLab supported?","response":"As of April 2025, integration with GitLab is not officially supported in Deployment Manager (only GitHub is referenced in documentation). It is on the roadmap but not yet supported.","category":"definitional","topic":"Deployment Manager"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for price uplift automation: Workflow or the Upload Tool?","response":"Workflow (WF) is often preferred and has been successfully implemented for customers (e.g., Chamberlain, iRobot) to handle price uplifts. The 'Batch Price Update' tool (Upload Tool) has limitations, such as lacking an option to make the price effective on the 'next billing day' and generally applying only to termed contracts, whereas Workflow can handle evergreen contracts and more complex logic.","category":"comparison","topic":"Price Uplift"}
{"instruction":"Can we filter invoices on the invoice page layout using a custom field from a related object (e.g., Account.EntityCountry)?","response":"No, you generally cannot use related object custom fields (like Account fields) as filters on the Invoice page list view. While you may be able to add them as display columns in the UI, they are not available for filtering. A support ticket may be raised, but it is currently a limitation.","category":"definitional","topic":"UI Customization"}
{"instruction":"What happens to the Credit Balance Adjustment (CBA) balance when enabling Invoice Settlement?","response":"When Invoice Settlement is enabled, the CBA balance is migrated and converted into a Credit Memo. There is no 'CBA balance' from that point forward. You can select the product that appears on this migration Credit Memo, so it is recommended to create a specific product/charge for this purpose to easily identify where the credit originated (and similarly for Bad Debt/Write-offs to ensure correct revenue handling).","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can we sync TCV and MRR calculated in Salesforce CPQ to Zuora Billing?","response":"If using the Zuora 360 sync (or the connector), data from the Rate Plan Charge object in Salesforce (often named `zqu__QuoteRatePlanCharge__c` or similar) contains these values. You can map these or sum them for specific dates. Alternatively, use the Salesforce CPQ connector to sync that data, mapping it into custom fields in Zuora.","category":"procedural","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora Tax or the Direct Avalara integration use the 'Bill To' contact for tax calculation instead of the default 'Sold To'?","response":"Zuora Tax allows for a billing rule to switch from SoldTo to BillTo. However, specifically for the Direct Avalara integration or changing the tax address basis within ZTax settings purely via configuration can be limited; confirm if the specific connector supports the 'Tax Address Source' setting or if a customization/rule is required.","category":"definitional","topic":"Tax"}
{"instruction":"Why would a Vertex V1 tax connector template return a 'Not Found' error when integrating with Taxamo?","response":"This error often occurs if the template references the wrong namespace (e.g., Vertex O Series) or if the connector run mode is incorrect. For Taxamo integrations, ensure the connector is configured correctly (checking if it's V1 XML or V2 JSON) and that the template matches the expected format for Taxamo. V2 is typically JSON-based.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Tax"}
{"instruction":"How can we model an Order Line Item (OLI) with tiered discounts (e.g., first unit free, second paid) without going outside Zuora?","response":"OLI does not support tiered pricing natively. A workaround is to use one-time charges to represent the booking, or model it as a subscription with a rate plan that has the tiered structure, but purely using OLI for this specific tiered discounting use case is unsupported.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Order Line Items"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer refund a subscription cancellation when the invoice contains multiple subscriptions?","response":"If an invoice contains multiple subscriptions, you cannot simply cancel/refund the single subscription via the basic 'cancel' button if it tries to reverse the whole invoice. The procedure is: 1) Create a Cancellation Order effective on the subscription start date. 2) Run a bill run to generate a Credit Memo for that specific subscription's charges. 3) Refund the Credit Memo to the payment method.","category":"procedural","topic":"Cancellations"}
{"instruction":"Can the Summary GL Connector for NetSuite support custom field mapping for Class and Line Memo?","response":"Yes, it is possible using Liquid syntax in the custom mapping configuration. For the Line Memo, you can append values like `{{JournalEntry.Number}} - {{JournalEntryItem.Type}}`. Mapping the 'Class' field is more complex and may require if/else logic in the Liquid code to determine the correct class based on product or segment data.","category":"procedural","topic":"GL Connector"}
{"instruction":"How can we structure a 39-month subscription where the billing period changes from Annual to a 15-month period for the final term?","response":"One approach is to create the subscription with a 39-month initial term. Use an amendment or ramp structure where the first two intervals are 12 months (Annual), and the third interval is explicitly set to a 15-month billing period (e.g., via a specific billing period setting on the charge or a ramp interval). Avoid creating separate short terms if revenue recognition relies on the total 39-month booking.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Subscription Design"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to filter invoices based on a custom field from the Account object using the page layout search/filter?","response":"No, while you can add Account custom fields as columns in the Invoice list view, you typically cannot use them as filter criteria in the UI. Filters are generally restricted to fields on the object itself (Invoices).","category":"definitional","topic":"UI Customization"}
{"instruction":"How can we handle a scenario where Zuora 360 only syncs the last segment of a subscription to Salesforce, missing split segments?","response":"This is a known behavior where Salesforce may only display the last segment of a version. There is no standard workaround within the standard 360 sync to force all split segments to appear as active distinct records if the sync logic prioritizes the latest state. Custom synchronization or reporting might be required to expose prior segment details in SFDC.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Zuora 360"}
{"instruction":"Does the HTML Invoice template support multi-lingual content in a single template?","response":"Yes, Zuora supports multi-lingual HTML billing document templates. You can configure merge fields and labels to dynamically display content based on the communication profile or locale of the customer, rather than creating separate templates for each language.","category":"definitional","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"How can we store Vertex tax fields outside of the standard Taxes tag in a custom field?","response":"If the standard integration does not support this, you may need to use the Object Query API (or Data Query) to retrieve the specific tax details and populate them into a custom field via a post-process update or workflow.","category":"procedural","topic":"Tax"}
{"instruction":"How can we ensure proration credits (from removal/cancellation) are auto-applied during a bill run with Invoice Settlement enabled?","response":"With Invoice Settlement, proration credits generate Credit Memos. If 'Auto-apply unapplied credit memos during payment runs' is enabled, they can settle invoices during a payment run. However, if not using Payment Runs, you must use a Workflow to auto-apply these Credit Memos to invoices. Note that if the invoice is settled/paid, the CM remains unapplied unless refunded.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"Why would Braintree 2.0 migration fail with CVV validation errors?","response":"This often happens if the gateway has 'Verify new Payment Method' enabled, which triggers a CVV check that fails because Zuora does not store/migrate CVVs. Ensure 'skipValidation' is set to true in the API call (if available/supported for the method) or work with the gateway to disable the strict CVV check for the migration batch. It may also relate to how tokens are generated and passed during the migration.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"Can we integrate Zuora with monitoring solutions like Datadog or Sentry?","response":"Yes, customers (e.g., Indeed, Cisco) have integrated these. It typically involves using the System Health API to pull status or Data Query to retrieve audit trail/log data, which is then pushed to the monitoring tool. There is no native 'plugin', so it requires an API-based integration or Workflow.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integrations"}
{"instruction":"How can we split an invoice for a new add-on charge from an existing subscription charge if the customer keeps the original invoice in draft?","response":"If the original invoice is in draft and a new charge is added, they will merge by default. To keep them separate, you can: 1) Post the first invoice before adding the second charge. 2) Use 'Bill Run Filters' to target specific rate plans/charges in separate bill runs. 3) Await a future feature (Q2 roadmap) that allows preventing invoices from merging into existing drafts.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"How can we handle the cancellation of a booked Order Line Item (OLI) prior to fulfillment/billing?","response":"If using OLI for booking, cancelling it before fulfillment can be complex. A recommended alternative for items like hardware or one-time services is to use a One-Time Charge (OTC) instead of an OLI. If the OTC is removed (via amendment) before the billing trigger date, it effectively cancels the booking without creating an invoice, working end-to-end.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Order Line Items"}
{"instruction":"Should we use HPP 2.0 or the Payment Form for a new implementation requiring multiple payment methods?","response":"Payment Form (PF) is generally recommended over HPP 2.0 as it was designed to display all available payment methods on a single page and is the newer solution (GA as of Q1). However, check for specific gaps like ReCaptcha support, Zuora Fraud Protection, or specific gateway support (e.g., EBANX) which might not yet be fully available in Payment Form.","category":"comparison","topic":"Payment Pages"}
{"instruction":"Why would 'Available to Credit' on an invoice show a negative amount after a subscription cancellation and bill run?","response":"This indicates a potential bug or configuration issue, often related to the 'Include billing engine credits in total available credit' setting. If set to 'Yes', the system might over-calculate the credit usage. It can also happen if a Credit Memo is generated for multiple invoices and the balance distribution logic fails.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"How do I resolve an 'Invalid Header' error when uploading FX rates?","response":"This error is usually due to file formatting. Ensure the file is saved as a standard CSV. Copying the contents to a plain text editor (Notepad) and saving as CSV often resolves hidden formatting issues introduced by Excel.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"How can we rename an existing Custom Field (API name) to free up the name?","response":"Officially, you cannot rename the API name of a custom field via the UI. The standard process is to create a new field, migrate data, and delete the old one. However, there is a non-documented API that can rename Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), though it historically had limitations with tax engine impacts. A fix for this is expected, but use with caution or consult support.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom Fields"}
{"instruction":"How can we pull future-starting rate plans into an earlier invoice (e.g., billing all 3 years of a term upfront)?","response":"To bill future-dated charges upfront, you generally need to set the Target Date of the Bill Run to cover the future period (e.g., 3 years out). If you need to selectively bill only specific charges, you can use Advanced Bill Run Filters to select those charges/subscriptions. However, you cannot easily pull a future charge into a *current* dated invoice without extending the target date of the bill run itself.","category":"procedural","topic":"Bill Runs"}
{"instruction":"How can we prevent over-crediting when an ad-hoc credit memo exists and the product removal date is subsequently changed?","response":"This is a process issue. If an ad-hoc credit memo was issued manually, the billing engine is not aware of it in the context of proration calculation when the removal date changes. You must manually manage this by verifying existing credits before processing the new amendment or adjusting the resulting credit memo to account for the ad-hoc one.","category":"procedural","topic":"Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"Can manual journal entries be created within Zuora Billing?","response":"Yes, you can create manual summary journal entries using the 'Journal Entry' object via the API or Data Loader. This allows you to bulk create journal entries directly in Zuora Billing.","category":"definitional","topic":"Finance"}
{"instruction":"Does the 'Zuora Connector for Salesforce CRM' (Cauldron) use SOAP or REST APIs?","response":"The connector primarily uses the SOAP API for continuous sync. However, for certain high-volume tasks or the new scheduled sync mode, it may utilize the Bulk API.","category":"definitional","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"What should I do if I get a 'ZOQL query is too long' error in an Export task?","response":"This error occurs when the query string exceeds 20,000 characters. Try reducing the number of fields selected or simplifying filters. Sometimes, simply logging out, clearing cache/cookies, and re-logging in can resolve transient issues with the query builder.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Exports"}
{"instruction":"Why does a Bill Run with Invoice Schedules fail with an error about documents not being posted?","response":"If you are using Invoice Schedules, the previous invoice in the schedule must be Posted before the next one can be generated. If 'Support bill run auto-post' is set to No, and the previous invoice is still in Draft, the bill run will fail. You must post the draft invoices first.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Invoice Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Can we create invoices in closed accounting periods during a data migration to apply accurate historical exchange rates?","response":"Zuora does not allow creating invoices in closed accounting periods. To use historical invoice dates (and thus historical FX rates), you must temporarily reopen the accounting periods, process the migration bill runs, and then re-close them. Ensure this is coordinated with finance to avoid impact on locked financial data.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can we force CPQ Quotes to recalculate previews in bulk?","response":"There is no native bulk recalculate button. You can use the `QuoteRecalculateController.JR_recalculate` class in a custom script, but it processes one record at a time and is asynchronous, making it non-trivial for large volumes.","category":"procedural","topic":"CPQ"}
{"instruction":"Does the Hosted Payment Method (HPM) page validate the State/Province field against the Country?","response":"Zuora's HPM checks that the State/Country codes match its internal list of valid ISO codes (e.g., 'TX' for Texas), but it does not perform a real-time address validation (e.g., checking if the Zip code matches the State). It is best practice to validate addresses via a 3rd party tool before passing data to Zuora.","category":"definitional","topic":"Hosted Payment Pages"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora vault SEPA details when using Stripe v2?","response":"Zuora does not typically 'vault' SEPA details (like IBAN) in the same way it vaults credit cards. It stores the data but primarily relies on the mandate/token (e.g., reference ID) generated by the gateway (Stripe) to process recurring payments. The stored IBAN in Zuora is often masked/encrypted and not sent in subsequent payment requests.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"If I change the accounting code on a product rate plan charge, does it affect historical invoices?","response":"No, changing the accounting code on the product/charge definition only affects invoices/revenue items generated *after* the change. Historical records retain the code that was active at the time of their creation. To update history, you would need to use the Mass Updater on the Revenue Items (if applicable) or manual journal adjustments.","category":"definitional","topic":"Accounting Codes"}
{"instruction":"How can I fix an HTML email template that renders in 'Internet Explorer compatibility mode' in Outlook?","response":"Outlook often uses the Word rendering engine which can behave like older IE versions. Adding meta tags like `<meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>` inside conditional comments `<!--[if !mso]><!--> ... <!--<![endif]-->` is a common attempt, but Outlook (mso) often ignores these. Inline CSS is the most reliable method for Outlook compatibility.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"How can I test 'expired credit card' functionality in My Account if I can't create a card with a past expiration date?","response":"You cannot easily create a card with a past expiration date in the UI/API. The workaround is to create a card expiring in the current month/year (or very near future) and wait for time to pass, or rely on simulating the *payment failure* response from a gateway rather than the expiration logic itself. There is no 'backdate' feature for expiration testing.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Testing"}
{"instruction":"How can we provide a 'grace period' for invoice payment without unposting/changing the due date?","response":"Handle this in the Dunning/Collections process. Create a custom field (e.g., 'GracePeriodDueDate') and update your dunning workflows to reference this field instead of the system 'Due Date'. This avoids modifying the immutable invoice record while delaying suspension/cancellation actions.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Collections"}
{"instruction":"What is the sequence of callouts for an 'Add Product' and 'Remove Product' order occurring on the same effective date?","response":"Callout sequencing cannot be guaranteed for multiple orders created/effective on the same day unless they are strictly serialized. They generally process in order of creation, but multiple queues can cause race conditions. For immediate deprovisioning, a single order or 'Revert' might be safer, or rely on the final state after all processing.","category":"definitional","topic":"Callouts"}
{"instruction":"How can we test System Health Notifications effectively?","response":"Many System Health alerts are triggered by failures (e.g., API failure, Workflow failure, Email bounce). To test, you must simulate these failures, such as intentionally breaking a workflow, sending an email to an invalid domain (though internal suppression might catch it), or triggering a bad API call. Performance alerts can be tested by temporarily lowering thresholds.","category":"best_practice","topic":"System Health"}
{"instruction":"Is there a native way to clone a subscription in Zuora?","response":"No, there is no native 'Clone Subscription' button or API. You must build a custom solution (Workflow or API integration) to read the existing subscription details and create a new one with the same parameters.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"Can we configure Configurable Lockbox to match payments to invoices if the bank file lacks a specific invoice number field?","response":"Configurable Lockbox has limited logic for parsing unstructured text to find invoice numbers. A better approach is to use a Workflow to ingest the file, parse the text using regex or logic to identify invoice numbers, and then apply the payments. Workflow offers more flexibility than the native Lockbox file mapping.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Lockbox"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to convert a Picklist custom field to a Text custom field?","response":"There is no automatic conversion. The official process is to create a new Text field, migrate the data, and delete the Picklist field. However, for Advanced Custom Fields, it may be possible to modify the metadata (removing the enum values) to effectively treat it as text, but this is a backend/engineering intervention and not a standard self-service feature.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom Fields"}
{"instruction":"Can we execute Custom Logic in Production while it is in Early Adopter (EA) status?","response":"Yes, Custom Logic can be enabled in Production environments upon request (via support ticket), provided there are no major blockers identified for your tenant.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom Logic"}
{"instruction":"How can we expose the Invoice PDF URL to a frontend application via API?","response":"You can use the `GetInvoicePdfStatus` API or similar calls to retrieve the `pdfFileURL`. This URL can be presented to the user, but ensure permissions and authentication context are handled correctly for the user accessing the link.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoices"}
{"instruction":"How can we trigger a workflow when a chargeback occurs?","response":"You can trigger a workflow based on the 'Payment Gateway Reconciliation' fields on the Payment object, specifically looking for status changes to 'Settled' or specific reason codes. Alternatively, look for the creation of an external Refund object with a reason code like 'Payment Rejection' or 'Chargeback', which is often how chargebacks are recorded in Zuora.","category":"procedural","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"How should we bill for Professional Services (milestones, hours) in Zuora?","response":"Professional Services can be billed using: 1) Invoice Schedules (for fixed milestones). 2) Usage records (where 1 unit = $1 or 1 hour) uploaded via API/file. 3) Standalone Invoices created via API. 4) Order Line Items (for revenue booking) combined with standalone invoices for billing. The choice depends on whether you need to recognize revenue differently from billing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Professional Services"}
{"instruction":"How can we handle Gift Cards in Zuora Billing?","response":"Model Gift Cards by creating a Credit Memo when the card is 'redeemed' or applied. Use a specific product for the Credit Memo that maps to a unique accounting code (e.g., 'Gift Card Liability'). This Credit Memo can then be applied to the invoice. Zuora does not manage the gift card balance/validity itself; that must be handled externally.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"Can we export Zuora Report results directly to SFTP?","response":"No, Zuora Reporting does not have an out-of-the-box feature to send report results to an SFTP server. You would need to build a Workflow or use an external ETL tool to retrieve the report data via API and push it to SFTP.","category":"definitional","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"How can we match payments to invoices after a lockbox load if the matching failed initially?","response":"If payments load to a dummy account or remain unapplied due to poor matching data, use a Workflow to iterate through these payments, apply logic to find the correct invoice (e.g., by amount, customer name, or secondary reference), and then use the 'Apply Payment' API to link them.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Lockbox"}
{"instruction":"How do I enable 'Delivery Pricing' in my tenant?","response":"The Knowledge Center may state it is self-service, but often it requires a support ticket to enable if the feature is not visible in 'Billing Settings'.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Pricing"}
{"instruction":"How long does Zuora retain customer data?","response":"Generally, Zuora retains core business data (Accounts, Subscriptions, Invoices) for the life of the tenant. There is no automatic archiving or deletion of this historical data after a set period. However, transient data like Workflow task history is retained for a shorter period (e.g., 45 days).","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Retention"}
{"instruction":"Can we disable the creation of $0 invoices?","response":"No, there is no global setting to strictly prevent the generation of $0 invoices if the billing logic results in a zero amount (e.g., 100% discount, free trial). They are generated as part of the audit trail.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"How can we display tiered pricing rows (e.g., 1-50 @ $3, 51-200 @ $2) on an HTML invoice template?","response":"You can iterate through the `RatePlanChargeTiers` object within the invoice template merge fields. Use conditional logic to display the specific tiers and their prices effectively. You may need to use advanced merge field syntax to filter/sort the tiers.","category":"procedural","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"What is the 'Bill recurring charges for subscriptions past end of term' setting?","response":"This setting (when set to 'Yes') allows Zuora to continue billing a subscription past its term end date, assuming it will renew. However, it is deprecated/not recommended because it can cause issues with ASC 606 revenue recognition compliance, as it generates invoices for periods not yet legally booked/renewed.","category":"definitional","topic":"Billing Settings"}
{"instruction":"Can we apply a fixed discount to each unit of a Per Unit charge?","response":"No, standard discount charges in Zuora typically apply to the total amount or are percentage-based. You cannot natively apply a 'fixed amount off per unit' (e.g., $5 off per license) using a standard Discount-Fixed Amount charge model against a Per Unit charge. You would need to use a percentage discount (calculated to match the amount) or a custom pricing model.","category":"definitional","topic":"Discounts"}
{"instruction":"How do we handle hardware fulfillment and invoicing when integrating with NetSuite?","response":"Since NetSuite often requires fulfillment before invoicing for inventory items (hardware), and Zuora might bill upon booking or a different trigger, a common pattern is: 1) Create the Order in Zuora (often via One-Time Charge). 2) Sync to NetSuite as a Sales Order. 3) Fulfill in NetSuite. 4) Use the fulfillment data to trigger the billing in Zuora (if bill-on-fulfillment) or simply sync the generated Invoice from Zuora to NetSuite, ensuring it links back to the Sales Order to close the loop.","category":"best_practice","topic":"NetSuite Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can we send an invoice to a customer N days before the actual invoice date?","response":"Use a scheduled Bill Run. Create a custom field on the account to define the 'lead time' (N days). Then, set up recurring scheduled Bill Runs that filter for accounts with that specific lead time and set the Bill Run's 'Target Date' to be `Date + N`. This effectively generates the invoice N days early covering the future period.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"How can we retry failed payments when using tokens?","response":"Retrying payments with tokens works the same as with raw card details. You can use the Configurable Payment Retry (CPR) feature or standard retry rules. The token (stored in the Payment Method) is used for the retry attempt against the gateway.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"How can we ingest Zuora Audit Trail logs into Splunk?","response":"You can use the Data Query API to extract audit trail records (e.g., `select * from AuditTrail`) and then push this data to Splunk's HTTP Event Collector (HEC) via a Workflow or an external script. There is no direct OOTB integration.","category":"procedural","topic":"Audit Trail"}
{"instruction":"Can we restore a Central Sandbox (CSBX) to a specific point in time?","response":"No, Zuora does not support point-in-time recovery or restoration for Sandboxes. You would need to rely on your own data backups and reload data via API/Data Loader if a rollback is needed.","category":"definitional","topic":"Sandbox Management"}
{"instruction":"How can we limit the quantity of an item sold (e.g., event seats) across multiple subscriptions?","response":"Zuora does not natively track 'global inventory' to limit sales across multiple subscriptions. You must handle this logic externally (e.g., in CPQ or the frontend) by checking the total sold count against a limit before allowing the quote/order to proceed. You can query Zuora for the total active quantity of that product to validate availability.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Inventory"}
{"instruction":"Can we use a Company Name in the Billing Contact First/Last Name fields?","response":"While Zuora requires First and Last Name, for B2B use cases where a specific person is not desired, it is best practice to enter the Company Name (e.g., First: 'Acme', Last: 'Corp') or use a generic value like 'Accounts Payable'. Some customers use 'Empty' or specific placeholders and then hide/replace them on the invoice template using a separate 'Company Name' custom field.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Contacts"}
{"instruction":"How can we extract detailed journal entry data (including segments) for Workday integration?","response":"The standard GL Interface often provides summary data. To get detailed entries with segment data, use Data Query to select from the `JournalEntryItem` table (joining with Account/Subscription fields as needed). Then use a Workflow to format this data and transmit it to Workday via API.","category":"procedural","topic":"GL Interface"}
{"instruction":"Can we update Prepaid Drawdown usage records after they are created?","response":"Yes, you can update usage records (including prepaid drawdown) via the API or Usage file upload by referencing the `UniqueKey` of the record. However, this is generally only possible *before* the usage has been invoiced. Once invoiced, the record is locked.","category":"procedural","topic":"Usage"}
{"instruction":"Is there a checklist or standard procedure for steps to take after a Zuora Billing central sandbox (CSBX) refresh?","response":"There is no single official exhaustive checklist, but several key actions are recommended. Standard post-refresh steps often include: (1) Re-configuring settings that are not preserved (e.g., usually payment gateways and tax engine credentials need re-entry, though some settings like SSO configuration for existing users may be preserved). (2) Provisioning users. (3) Updating templates and workflows if necessary. (4) Remapping invoice/credit memo PDF template IDs if they changed during the refresh (though typically these IDs should persist, some users have reported needing to remap them). It is noted that generally, CSBX refreshes bring over full configuration and transactional data from Production, but specific sensitive integrations (tax, payment gateways) often need manual reconfiguration.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"If I update Payment Retry rules to increase the allowable failures from 2 to 3, do I need to manually retry currently suspended customers who failed after 2 attempts?","response":"Yes, you generally need to take manual action for customers already in a suspended state. Simply changing the rule configuration usually applies to future payment attempts or active retries. Customers who have already hit the previous limit and entered a suspended status will likely not automatically re-enter the retry cycle without manual intervention or a manual retry attempt.","category":"procedural","topic":"Payment Retry"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to hide or conditionally disable the 'Post Invoice' button on a Bill Run or Invoice in the Zuora UI?","response":"There is no direct UI setting to conditionally hide or disable the 'Post' button for specific workflows while keeping it for others. Removing the 'Post Invoice' permission from a user's role will hide/disable the button for that user entirely. A suggested workaround for controlling posting via workflow is to have two user types: 'Billing Users' (who use the UI and have the 'Post Invoice' permission removed) and 'API Users' (used by Workflows, which retain the 'Post Invoice' permission to post invoices automatically via API upon workflow completion).","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"UI Customization"}
{"instruction":"How can a customer migrate from a Monthly List Price model to an Annual List Price model for existing subscriptions?","response":"There are two primary options: (1) Update the product catalog to Annual, then bulk update all existing subscriptions to remove the monthly rate plans and add the new annual rate plans. This is a heavy data migration effort with significant downstream revenue and CPQ impact. (2) Handle the transition at renewal: create a new version of the product (Annual) and systematically switch customers to the new annual plan upon their next renewal (e.g., via auto-switch logic or manual amendment). Option 2 is generally less disruptive but takes longer to fully migrate the base. Option 1 provides immediate alignment but requires heavy testing, particularly for Revenue and CPQ implications.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Pricing Migration"}
{"instruction":"Can I assign a specific language (e.g., French) for password reset emails sent to subscriber portal end users?","response":"Translation capabilities in the subscriber portal generally apply to the web presentation, not the system emails. To support multiple languages for password reset emails, you must create a combined email template (e.g., containing both English and French text) in the 'Look and Feel' settings, as there is no native feature to dynamically select the email template language based on the user's locale.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Why does a PayPal payment fail with 'MISSING_REQUIRED_PAR' during a payment run when the first payment worked fine?","response":"This error often indicates that the Payment Method created in Zuora is missing required token information or attributes needed for recurring transactions (Reference Transactions) via the PayPal Commerce Platform. If the payment method displays as 'PayPal Commerce Platform null', it suggests the tokenization process was incomplete or the billing agreement ID was not properly captured or mapped for subsequent recurring use.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"PayPal Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can I format the output of a Data Query `EXPLAIN PLAN` to be readable?","response":"You can use the `jq` command-line tool to format the JSON output. For example: `jq -r '.[\"Query Plan\"]'`. Alternatively, you can use `EXPLAIN (FORMAT GRAPHVIZ)` and view the result in a graph visualization tool.","category":"how_to","topic":"Data Query"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to use OAuth authentication for internal Zuora callouts (e.g., calling Zuora's own API via a custom callout)?","response":"While technically possible, OAuth for callouts is typically designed for external integrations. For internal Zuora API calls triggered by a callout, using Basic Authentication (username/password) or a dedicated API user is the standard and simpler approach. Configuring OAuth for internal loop-back calls adds unnecessary complexity compared to standard authentication methods.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Callouts"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora support co-terming subscriptions where the price is calculated based on rounded months (like Salesforce CPQ) while keeping accurate start/end dates?","response":"Zuora Billing does not have an out-of-the-box (OOTB) setting to calculate charges based on 'rounded' months (e.g., treating 10 months and 10 days as exactly 10 months for pricing) while simultaneously maintaining the exact legal start and end dates on the subscription object. Standard proration in Zuora uses exact days. Workarounds include custom implementations using Bill Cycle Day alignment or custom fields to store 'presentation dates' while manipulating the actual billing dates to achieve the desired price, but these are complex and require extensive testing.","category":"comparison","topic":"Proration Logic"}
{"instruction":"How can I remove a subscription-level custom field value from *all* previous subscription versions via API or Workflow?","response":"There is no single API call to update all historical versions of a subscription at once. You must identify all version IDs for the subscription and iterate through them. In Workflow, you can achieve this by performing an Object Query to retrieve all subscription versions (`Ids`), and then using an Iterator with a CRUD:Update task (using the `[*] ` syntax or iterating individually) to clear the custom field on each version.","category":"procedural","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"Is there a mass update API for creating Orders for multiple accounts at once?","response":"There is no single synchronous API endpoint that accepts a payload for multiple unrelated accounts. You must either (1) iterate through accounts and make individual Create Order API calls for each, or (2) use the Bulk API (Data Loader) to import a CSV file of orders for mass processing.","category":"procedural","topic":"Orders API"}
{"instruction":"Is Custom Logic (specifically for usage rating) GA or EA?","response":"Custom Logic is effectively in a state similar to Early Access (EA) or a controlled General Availability (GA). It is available in Production for multiple customers but may require Product Management approval to enable. The Knowledge Center (KC) stating it is 'Sandbox only' is outdated; it can be enabled in Production upon request.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom Logic"}
{"instruction":"How do I configure a Prepaid with Drawdown (PPDD) scenario where the customer is charged an Annual fee but receives Quarterly allotments?","response":"You cannot have a single charge with different validity (Quarterly) and billing (Annual) periods where the billing period is not a multiple of the validity period in the way required here. The recommended workaround is to split this into two charges: (1) An Annual Recurring Charge for the fee, and (2) A separate Prepaid Charge billed Quarterly at $0 to handle the quarterly unit allotment (validity).","category":"best_practice","topic":"Prepaid with Drawdown"}
{"instruction":"How can I manage deployment of Zuora workflows using Git version control?","response":"You can use the 'Deployment Manager' which supports integration with GitHub (Cloud or Enterprise). This allows you to manage Workflow definitions and Configuration Templates in a Git repository. For non-GitHub repositories (like GitLab), native support is not yet available, but you can build a custom integration using the Workflow Import/Export APIs.","category":"how_to","topic":"Deployment Manager"}
{"instruction":"Why is the subscription number being overwritten by the Opportunity Name when creating a subscription via CPQ X?","response":"This is often the default behavior in CPQ X plugin settings. You can change this configuration in the 'Default Value Settings' (within the CPQ Admin settings, distinct from Quote Studio settings) to prevent the Opportunity Name from mapping to the Subscription Number.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"CPQ X"}
{"instruction":"Do custom fields created directly in a Central Sandbox (CSBX) persist after a refresh from Production?","response":"No. A Central Sandbox refresh overwrites the sandbox with a copy of Production data and configuration. Any custom fields or objects created *only* in the CSBX (and not in Prod) will be lost after the refresh. Only specific preserved settings (like some SSO configs or pre-configured test user emails, depending on settings) are retained; schema changes are not.","category":"definitional","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"Can I set a specific tax accounting code on a Standalone Invoice via API?","response":"Currently, the 'Create Standalone Invoice' API does not support explicitly setting the accounting code for tax items directly in the payload in the same way you can for invoice items. The system typically applies default tax accounting codes based on the tax code configuration.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Standalone Invoices"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora Revenue have its own time zone setting?","response":"Zuora Revenue typically operates in EST (Eastern Standard Time) by default for its internal processing, distinct from the Zuora Billing tenant time zone setting.","category":"definitional","topic":"Zuora Revenue"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to prevent the 'Post Invoice' button from being active until a workflow completes?","response":"Not dynamically on a per-invoice basis via the UI. You can disable the 'Post Invoice' permission for users to prevent manual posting entirely, and then rely on a Workflow to perform the posting via API once all validations/steps are complete.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to delete deactivated users in Zuora?","response":"No, you cannot permanently delete users in Zuora, even if they are deactivated. This is to maintain audit trails (e.g., who performed past actions).","category":"definitional","topic":"User Management"}
{"instruction":"Can I import a Word-based mail merge template directly into the HTML Invoice Template editor?","response":"No. The HTML Invoice Template editor supports importing JSON files (which contain the HTML template structure exported from Zuora), but it cannot convert or import Microsoft Word mail merge templates (`.doc`/`.docx`). You must manually rebuild the template using the HTML editor or drag-and-drop builder.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"How does 'Batch Price Update' or 'Mass Price Update' handle evergreen subscriptions?","response":"Batch/Mass Price Update functionality has limitations with evergreen subscriptions, particularly regarding setting the 'effective date' of the price change to align with the 'next billing cycle' dynamically. It often requires a custom Workflow to calculate the correct effective date for each evergreen subscription and apply the update via Order/Amendment, as the native tool may not support 'End of Last Invoice Period' logic for evergreen subscriptions correctly yet.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Price Updates"}
{"instruction":"Can I consolidate multiple Credit Memos into a single Refund transaction?","response":"No, Zuora does not support consolidated refunds natively. Refunds are transaction-based and typically linked 1:1 to a specific Credit Memo or Payment. To refund a total amount from multiple CMs, you would typically need to issue separate refunds for each CM, or (workaround) create a standalone 'refund' payment or external refund, though this causes reconciliation challenges.","category":"definitional","topic":"Refunds"}
{"instruction":"How can we consolidate multiple Credit Memos or Payments into a single refund if the gateway enforces referenced refunds?","response":"If the gateway enforces referenced refunds (where each refund must be linked to a specific payment), it is impossible to aggregate them into a single refund transaction. A recommended workaround is to create a new standalone Credit Memo for the total refund amount, refund that via the gateway, and then create external refunds against the original individual Credit Memos or Payments in Zuora to balance the books.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Refunds"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to migrate a customer entity to a new tenant while retaining all historical data?","response":"Migrating an entity to a new tenant while keeping history is difficult. A 'Z-to-Z' migration often results in lost history. While Engineering may technically be able to 'pop out' an isolated entity, this is not a standard procedure. The recommended approach is usually to split the tenant or implement a cutover where history is archived rather than migrated.","category":"procedural","topic":"Tenant Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can we configure a drawdown model where the first set of units (e.g., 10) are free/included?","response":"You can configure a Drawdown Usage charge using the 'Overage Pricing' charge model. Set the included units to the desired free amount (e.g., 10). Combine this with a prepayment charge. This allows the first 10 units to be consumed for free, followed by drawdown from the prepayment for subsequent units.","category":"procedural","topic":"Drawdown"}
{"instruction":"How can we export Revenue Recognition Rule records since they aren't available in Export ZOQL?","response":"Revenue Recognition Rules can be retrieved using the REST API endpoint `GET /settings/revenue-recognition-rules`. They are not currently queryable via Export ZOQL or the Data Source Export.","category":"procedural","topic":"Revenue Recognition"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'Prerated Per Unit' charge model supported for Minimum Commitment features?","response":"No, the 'Prerated Per Unit' charge model is not currently supported for Minimum Commitment. Additionally, Minimum Commitment does not support proration.","category":"definitional","topic":"Minimum Commitment"}
{"instruction":"How can we disable Z-Tax calculation for a specific invoice, such as a migration invoice?","response":"There is no direct setting on the bill run or invoice creation to disable tax. A common workaround is to set the 'Tax Region' on the Sold-To contact to a value that maps to a 0% tax rate in your tax engine, generate the migration invoice, and then revert the setting.","category":"procedural","topic":"Taxation"}
{"instruction":"What should we do if a Data Query is hitting limits or timing out?","response":"Use the 'Index Join' feature. Ensure that the table in the FROM clause (the driver table) is relatively small. If filtering on Subscription status, it is often better to drive the query from the Subscription table rather than the Account table if the Account table has no filters.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Query"}
{"instruction":"Why can't I activate 'Suspend/Resume' jobs from the Business Automation Dashboard?","response":"The Business Automation Dashboard features for Suspend/Resume are currently de-documented and often function incorrectly (creating jobs in DRAFT/Inactive state). While APIs exist, the feature is considered unstable. Fixes are expected in future releases (e.g., Q2.1.0), but usage is currently discouraged.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Business Automation"}
{"instruction":"How can I find the API name for the Payment Gateway field on the Account object?","response":"Payment Gateways are not directly associated with the Account object; they are associated with Payment Methods. To update the gateway for an account's default payment method, you would check the `paymentGateway` field on the Payment Method object or via the `PUT Account` operation for the default payment method.","category":"definitional","topic":"Object Model"}
{"instruction":"How can I identify which user is triggering scheduled Bill Runs or Payment Runs?","response":"For scheduled Bill Runs, check the 'Created By' field in the 'Manage Scheduled Bill Runs' UI. For Payment Runs, open a PENDING run to see the creator. To change the user context, the job must be re-scheduled by the new user.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Scheduled Jobs"}

{"instruction":"How does Zuora calculate the Subscription End Date for a 13-month term starting Sept 30?","response":"Zuora calculates terms by adding the month count to the start date. For a 13-month term starting Sept 30, the calculation is Sept 30 + 13 months = Oct 30 (of the following year), not Oct 31.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Dates"}
{"instruction":"What is the performance impact of having hundreds of charges on a single subscription?","response":"Having hundreds of charges on a single subscription can lead to severe performance degradation in bill runs and the UI. It is recommended to keep the charge count lower (around 50) or split the subscription/account if possible.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Performance"}
{"instruction":"How can we visualize AI usage on a customer portal without charging the customer or changing rate plans?","response":"You can upload the usage to Zuora and rate it at $0 (using a $0 rate plan). This allows the usage quantity to be reported and visualized without generating a charge on the invoice. Alternatively, usage data can be aggregated in a custom object.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage"}
{"instruction":"How do I access the old Custom Field pages for configuration?","response":"You can access the legacy custom field pages by navigating directly to URLs like `{tenant_url}/apps/CustomField.do?menu=Z-Billing`.","category":"procedural","topic":"UI Navigation"}
{"instruction":"Why is my HTML template condition for excluding US and Canada always returning true?","response":"Using `country != 'US' OR country != 'CA'` will always evaluate to true. You must use `AND` logic: `country != 'US' AND country != 'CA'`.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling a 'buyout' or recovery payment for a written-off account?","response":"Do not cancel the subscription if you expect to resume billing. Instead, suspend the subscription. You can accept the payment as an unapplied payment and then create a standalone invoice or debit memo to offset it, or apply it to future invoices upon resumption.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Collections"}
{"instruction":"Why does the Orders API require an array of trigger dates (CED, SAD, CAD)?","response":"The Orders API uses an array for `triggerDates` to support different dates for different charges. Even if you only need one date (e.g., Contract Effective), the API structure often requires all three (Contract Effective, Service Activation, Customer Acceptance) to be explicitly provided in the array unless tenant settings allow them to auto-populate.","category":"definitional","topic":"Orders API"}
{"instruction":"Which permission controls the ability to 'Unpost' a Credit Memo?","response":"The ability to unpost a Credit Memo is controlled by the 'Cancel Posted Billing Documents' permission located under the Invoice section of the Billing Role settings.","category":"definitional","topic":"Permissions"}
{"instruction":"Why does the `/web-payments/sessions` API require an amount even when `processPayment` is false?","response":"The `amount` field is required to perform a validation authorization (auth-only) to ensure the payment method is valid. This amount is authorized but immediately cancelled and not captured. You can pass a standard small amount (e.g., 2.00).","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"How can we identify EU countries in an HTML invoice template without listing them all?","response":"There is no native 'EU' region flag available in templates. You must explicitly list the 27 EU countries in a conditional statement (e.g., using `Wp_Eval` with an array check) to display specific notes for EU customers.","category":"procedural","topic":"HTML Templates"}
{"instruction":"How do I create an Order for a subscription where the Invoice Owner is different from the Subscription Owner?","response":"When using the Orders API, specify the Invoice Owner's account number in the `existingAccountNumber` field of the Order header. Previous documentation referencing nested fields for this was incorrect.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Orders API"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement a 'Buy Now Pay Later' flow with partial upfront payment and installments?","response":"Create the Order with `runBilling` and `collectPayment` set to `false`. Then, create a Payment Schedule for the installment portion. Finally, trigger the upfront collection separately. Attempting to do all in one step via the Order API often conflicts because the Payment Schedule doesn't exist yet.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payment Schedules"}
{"instruction":"How can we mass close or delete payment methods?","response":"To delete, use the `Action Delete` API (limit 50 per call) or a Workflow designed to iterate and delete. To 'close' a payment method, you can use `Action Update` to set it to closed (note: this may require older API versions or specific fields).","category":"procedural","topic":"Payment Methods"}
{"instruction":"Is the QuickStart (v2) API being deprecated?","response":"The QuickStart (v2) API is not being deprecated or sunset, but it is in 'maintenance mode'. No new features will be added. New integrations should rely on the v1 API or the new Client Libraries (SDKs).","category":"definitional","topic":"API Lifecycle"}
{"instruction":"How can we prevent the generation of $0.00 invoices?","response":"There is no Out-of-the-Box feature to globally prevent the generation of $0 invoices.

{"instruction":"Which Payment Gateway Account Updater (PMU) should I use: Adyen or Cybersource?","response":"Adyen's Account Updater only works with the Adyen gateway. Cybersource's Account Updater is gateway-agnostic and can work across multiple gateways. If you have a multi-gateway strategy, Cybersource is recommended.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'Ship To Contact' feature work?","response":"You must enable the `ShipToContactSupport` permission. The 'Ship To' label in the UI only appears if a contact is explicitly assigned as the 'Ship To' contact on the account or subscription, not just because the contact exists.","category":"definitional","topic":"Contacts"}

{"instruction":"How can we send payment failure notifications to a third party (like Vindicia) after a specific number of retries in Zuora?","response":"Zuora does not have a native interface to send payment failures to external systems. You must build this integration, either near real-time via notifications or in batch via Workflow. Note that Zuora generates a new payment ID for each retry, so it does not 'retry' a single payment record in the strict sense. An example implementation (e.g., Hootsuite) involves using CPR for retries for a set period (e.g., 30 days), then extracting unpaid payments to the third party, and finally using a Workflow to cancel the subscription if still unpaid.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payment Retry Integration"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to update custom fields at the subscription level within the same Create Order API call used to create the subscription?","response":"Yes, it is possible to populate custom fields on the subscription object during the Create Order API call.

Best practice is to perform a post-refresh cleanup or sync just after a close and ignore any transactions that entered during the open period.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Sandbox Refresh Strategy"}
{"instruction":"How can we trigger a renewal or provisioning notification for a product sold without an electronic payment method (i.e., no payment success event)?","response":"You can use the standard renewal triggers (e.g., 'Subscription Renewed' or 'Order Action Processed') which fire for all renewals regardless of payment method, rather than relying on payment success events.","category":"procedural","topic":"Renewal Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Can we specify a partial payment amount directly in the OrderCreate API?","response":"No, the OrderCreate API does not support specifying a partial payment amount directly.

{"instruction":"How can we handle high-volume usage corrections (additions or reductions) via file upload?","response":"A recommended pattern is to use 'pre-rated' charges where you configure the rate plan with both a standard positive usage charge and a separate negative 'correction' usage charge. You can then upload negative values to the correction charge to adjust billing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Corrections"}
{"instruction":"What are the guidelines for implementing e-mandates for recurring transactions in India?","response":"Regulations in India are strict regarding data storage (PCI) and e-mandates. If collecting payment methods directly, merchants are often expected to generate the recurring mandate themselves. Refer to Zuora documentation on 'Processing of e-mandate on cards for recurring transactions in India' and Stripe v2 support for specific gateway implementation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"India E-Mandate"}
{"instruction":"How do I fix an HTML template error where the 'Localise' filter breaks comma formatting in a summed custom field?","response":"The `|Localise` filter is likely placed incorrectly inside a nested merge field. The correct syntax should place it outside the calculation logic, for example: `{{#Wp_Eval}}{{ByNetPricePerUnit__c|Sum(LineTotalAmount__c)|Round(2)}}|Localise{{/Wp_Eval}}`.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"HTML Template Formatting"}
{"instruction":"Why is AvaTax still applying tax even though I set 'Tax Exempt' to 'Yes' on the account?","response":"For AvaTax, setting the 'Tax Exempt' flag is not sufficient. You must also provide a valid 'Entity/Use Code' in addition to the certificate ID, as per the Knowledge Center documentation.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"AvaTax Exemption"}
{"instruction":"How can we bulk load subscriptions that contain RAMP deals?","response":"You should use the Orders API to bulk load subscriptions with RAMP deals. The standard Subscribe/Amend API or simple imports may not support the complexity of RAMP structures effectively.","category":"procedural","topic":"Bulk Load RAMP Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"Which Salesforce object should we use to report on forecasted MRR/ARR for both signed and unsigned quotes?","response":"Since Quotes contain MRR at a static point in time (and don't reflect billing lifecycle changes like renewals), it is recommended to use Zuora 360 sync to report on live subscription metrics from Salesforce. For unsigned business, you may need to report on the Opportunity or Quote objects, bearing in mind the static nature of Quote data.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Forecasted MRR Reporting"}
{"instruction":"What is the advantage of using an 'Estimated Start Date' versus a 'Specific Start Date' for pending subscriptions?","response":"The main advantage is that it allows a subscription to be created and activated even if the true start date is unknown. This enables you to perform actions on the subscription (like adding charges or cancelling) which might be restricted if the subscription were merely in a pending/draft state waiting for a specific date.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Pending Subscriptions Start Date"}
{"instruction":"Can a customer change their Home Currency (e.g., from AUD to USD) after implementation?","response":"No, the Home Currency is a one-time setting and cannot be changed once set. However, if the customer switches to Multi-Org, they can have different reporting currencies for different organizations.","category":"definitional","topic":"Home Currency Change"}
{"instruction":"Can we correct the order date for subscriptions in production via the backend if a workflow bug caused incorrect dates?","response":"No, you should not attempt backend data corrections. The best practice is to correct the data using standard billing operations, such as performing an amendment or a cancel-and-rewrite of the subscription.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Correction"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to use custom fonts in Zuora HTML email templates?","response":"Yes, it is possible by defining the font in the HTML/CSS (e.g., `font-family: 'MyCustomFont'`). However, this requires the email client to support the font or for it to be hosted publicly.","category":"procedural","topic":"HTML Template Custom Fonts"}
{"instruction":"Can we customize the naming convention of the GL outbound file in Zuora Revenue?","response":"No, the naming convention for GL outbound files in Zuora Revenue is not customizable.","category":"definitional","topic":"Revenue GL File Naming"}
{"instruction":"Does the Zuora Connector for SAP sync invoice PDF files to SAP?","response":"No, the SAP connector only syncs financial data (AR journals), not the actual invoice PDF files.","category":"definitional","topic":"SAP Connector PDF Sync"}
{"instruction":"Can we combine Prepayment with High Water Mark (HWM) usage billing?","response":"Unit-based Prepayment with Drawdown (PPDD) combined with HWM is generally not supported or logical because HWM applies to overage. Currency-based PPDD works if 'Unbilled Usage' is enabled (EA feature), but HWM has a limitation where it ignores price overrides and only uses catalog prices. A common workaround is to implement HWM logic in Mediation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Prepayment HWM Billing"}
{"instruction":"Is the Subscribe/Amend API being End-of-Life (EOL)?","response":"No, there is no EOL planned for the Subscribe/Amend API, but it is in maintenance mode and will not receive new features.","category":"definitional","topic":"API Lifecycle"}
{"instruction":"Does the Journal Run rollup to home currency use the transaction date's FX rate?","response":"Yes, if the transaction date exists and the system is set to use daily rates (without offset), the Journal Run uses the FX rate from the transaction date.","category":"definitional","topic":"Journal Run FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle a requirement where an SAP order sends a net amount, but the customer wants to track the Gross amount and a separate Discount line in Zuora?","response":"A recommended approach is to create a $0 discount charge in the Product Catalog and use a Workflow to update the subscription, adding the discount charge and adjusting the price to reflect the gross vs. effective (net) difference. Alternatively, middleware (like SAP PI/PO) can map the discount logic during the transformation before it reaches Zuora.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Order Discount Handling"}
{"instruction":"How can we handle multiple shipping addresses for hardware in a CPQ X quote?","response":"The 'ShipTo' contact feature is released in Billing but may not yet be fully supported in CPQ X. A common workaround is to use custom fields on the Quote Rate Plan or Quote Rate Plan Charge to capture the specific ship-to address for each line item. You can also filter Salesforce contact lookups by role to help users select the correct address.","category":"best_practice","topic":"CPQ X Shipping Addresses"}
{"instruction":"What controls can be put in place to ensure invoices are generated for all customers for compliance?","response":"Best practices include: 1) Ensuring all accounts are assigned to batches that have scheduled bill runs. 2) Configuring notifications for bill run completion. 3) creating a reconciliation report that checks active subscription charges to ensure their `chargedThroughDate` matches the current term start/end dates.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoice Generation Compliance"}
{"instruction":"How long does a Billing Preview run take, and where are the results stored?","response":"The execution time is linear and depends on the volume of data and the target date (dates further in the future take longer). Results are available in the `billingpreviewrunresult` table if the `storageOption` was set to Database.","category":"definitional","topic":"Billing Preview"}
{"instruction":"How do I fix an API filter error when using syntax like `plans?%filter[]=Channel__c.EQ:Digital`?","response":"The `%` symbol is incorrect. The correct syntax is `GET /v2/plans?filter[]=Channel__c.EQ:Digital`. Alternatively, using the Object Query API is often recommended.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"API Filter Syntax"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to generate a single payment link that covers multiple open invoices for an account?","response":"No, Zuora payment links are generated for specific invoices. There is no out-of-the-box feature to generate a single link that aggregates multiple invoices.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Links"}
{"instruction":"How can we suppress the automatic creation of a Credit Memo when cancelling a subscription billed in advance?","response":"A workaround is to set the cancellation effective date to the end of the current term (future dated) so no credit is due. If immediate cancellation is required without credit, you might need a workflow to manage the cancellation and refund logic explicitly, but standard immediate cancellation will trigger a credit for unused periods.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Suppress Credit Memo"}
{"instruction":"How can we remove the header row of a CSV file within a Workflow?","response":"You can use the CSV Translator task in Workflow and configure it to filter out the first row by row number.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow CSV Manipulation"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit to the number of subscriptions or accounts that can be assigned to a single Invoice Owner?","response":"There is no strict system limit for Orders tenants. Customers (like Edenred) have had tens of thousands of subscriptions on a single account. However, practical limits apply regarding invoice PDF generation size and timeout limits for external tax engines.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Owner Limits"}
{"instruction":"What is the syntax to link a discount percentage rate plan charge to a specific one-time charge via API?","response":"You need to use the `ProductDiscountApplyDetailData` structure in the API payload. Specifically, you may need to include the `AppliedProductRatePlanId` (which might be undocumented) to correctly link the discount to the target charge.","category":"procedural","topic":"Discount Charge API"}
{"instruction":"How can we map a Vertex Flex Field to a custom field on a Taxation Item?","response":"First, ask Zuora Support to enable Vertex flex fields for the tenant. Then, create a custom field on the TaxationItem object that matches the API naming rules defined in the 'Flexible Tax Mapping' documentation. The connector handles the mapping automatically if the names align.","category":"procedural","topic":"Vertex Flex Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Does the 'Enable Order for CPQ' setting need to be enabled if using Salesforce CPQ?","response":"No, that setting is typically for Zuora CPQ (related to Order Harmonization). It is generally not required for Salesforce CPQ integrations.","category":"definitional","topic":"CPQ Settings"}
{"instruction":"Can we create draft orders using CPQ X and Order Harmonization without being on the full Orders feature?","response":"Order Harmonization effectively enables Orders. Therefore, you can use Orders features like Draft Orders with CPQ X as long as Order Harmonization is enabled and CPQ X is configured to use Orders.","category":"definitional","topic":"CPQ X Draft Orders"}
{"instruction":"How can we query the latest invoice a payment is applied to, especially if it has been unapplied and reapplied?","response":"The `PaymentApplication` table provides the full history of applications. To see the *currently* applied amount/invoice, check the `PaymentPart` (or `InvoicePayment` object). For refunds, check `RefundPart`.","category":"procedural","topic":"Payment Application Query"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'Negative Usage' upload feature supported?","response":"No, the Negative Usage upload feature was in Early Availability (EA) but is no longer supported. The recommended workaround is to use two charges: one for positive usage and one for negative usage corrections.","category":"definitional","topic":"Negative Usage"}
{"instruction":"Can we update the comments on a Debit Memo without unposting it?","response":"Currently, you must unpost the Debit Memo (move it to draft) to update comments. However, an update to support this on posted documents is expected in an upcoming release.","category":"definitional","topic":"Debit Memo Comments"}
{"instruction":"Can subscriptions suspended by an Amendment (pre-migration) be resumed using an Order?","response":"No. Subscriptions suspended via Amendment must be resumed via Amendment (or the UI). Subscriptions suspended via Order must be resumed via Order.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Resume Suspended Subscription"}
{"instruction":"Why does the `v1/subscriptions/preview` API fail for USD but work for other currencies like GBP?","response":"This error occurs if the currency is not activated at the Product Rate Plan Charge level. You must go to the product catalog and 'Activate' the specific currency for that charge.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Subscription Preview Currency"}
{"instruction":"How can we build custom payment retry rules for a customer who hasn't purchased CPR (Configurable Payment Retry)?","response":"While you can use the basic default retry rules in Payment Settings, advanced logic must be built externally (e.g., via Workflow). For example, some implementations use Workflow to handle retries for specific methods like Credit Cards or PAD/ACH. However, purchasing CPR is strongly recommended to avoid high maintenance overhead.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Payment Retry"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to trigger a Bill Run Completion event only for specific batches (e.g., Batches='AllBatches')?","response":"The 'Batches' field is not supported in the standard Event Trigger for Bill Runs. A workaround is to use a naming convention for Bill Runs and use a JEXL condition on the Bill Run name, though this is difficult if Bill Runs are auto-generated from Invoice Schedules without custom names.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Bill Run Event Trigger"}
{"instruction":"How can we set a specific 'Return-Path' for emails sent via the notification framework when using an external SMTP server?","response":"You can achieve this by adding a 'Return-Path' header directly to the Email Template configuration.","category":"procedural","topic":"Email Return Path"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to retrieve a custom field value, generated by a Custom Logic function, in the response of a Create Subscription API call?","response":"No, it is likely not possible to retrieve the value in the same response. The Custom Logic update typically occurs after the Create Subscription call is completed, meaning the API response is generated before the custom field value has been populated.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Custom Logic API Response"}
{"instruction":"Is information about bounced emails available in Zuora when integrating with SendGrid, particularly to trigger downstream processes like physical letters?","response":"Yes, Zuora shows bounced email notification history (released in 2023.11.R2) and provides an alert bounce event (released in 2024.04.R1). However, if an external SMTP server (like SendGrid) is configured, the bounce information might not route back to Zuora and may only be visible in the external SMTP logs.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Email Bounces SendGrid"}

{"instruction":"How can I configure a bill run to execute on the 3rd of the month but only bill usage from the previous calendar month (1st-31st), given a 2-day upload delay?","response":"You can achieve this by removing the charge-level billing day (defaulting to the 3rd) and configuring the bill run with an Invoice Date of the 1st (e.g., 07/01) and a Target Date of the 3rd (e.g., 08/03). This configuration ensures usage is picked up through the end of the previous month while the bill run executes on the 3rd.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Bill Run Delayed Usage"}
{"instruction":"Is the Minimum Commitment marketplace app still recommended, or should we use the core feature?","response":"The Minimum Commitment marketplace app is in maintenance mode.

{"instruction":"How can I apply an existing unapplied Credit Memo to an invoice generated by a subscription cancellation order (with runBilling=true)?","response":"You cannot automatically apply an *existing* unapplied Credit Memo to a new invoice generated within the same Order call (using `runBilling=true`, `applyCredit=true`). `applyCredit=true` typically applies credit memos generated *within* that order context. You must handle the cash application (pick and apply) as a separate step after the invoice is generated.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Cancel Subscription Credit Memo"}
{"instruction":"How do I flip the symbol for credit memo amounts on an invoice template so they appear as negative values?","response":"You can use a merge field expression to multiply the amount by -1. For example: `{{#Wp_Eval}}(-1)*{{Invoice.Balance|Round(2)|Localise}}{{/Wp_Eval}}`.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Invoice Template Merge Fields"}
{"instruction":"Is there documentation available regarding Zuora's support for Hardware products?","response":"Yes, there is a guide available on the Zuora Developer Center that details hardware support and capabilities.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Hardware Support"}
{"instruction":"How can we prevent confidential production data from being exposed to external parties when refreshing a Central Sandbox?","response":"It is best practice to avoid giving external parties access to a Central Sandbox (which is a copy of Production). Instead, use a separate Developer Sandbox. Additionally, certain fields can be scrubbed during the sandbox refresh process.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Sandbox Data Scrubbing"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle Credit Memos created during a subscription suspension if the subscription is later resumed or cancelled?","response":"If a subscription is resumed, the Credit Memos (CMs) created for the suspension period are not automatically reversed. If the subscription is cancelled, writing off the CM (and the invoice) is the recommended approach to clear the balance and correctly manage revenue.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Suspend Resume Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"Can we route Canadian tax to Z-Tax and US tax to Avalara within the same tenant?","response":"Yes, this is supported out-of-the-box using the Tax Engine Mapping Formula, allowing different tax engines to be used for different jurisdictions on a single charge.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Tax Engine Routing"}
{"instruction":"How can I identify which subscriptions were processed by a Catch Up Bill Run?","response":"You can identify these subscriptions by running a query filtered by `RatePlanCharge.UpdatedDate` corresponding to the bill run time. Alternatively, create a Data Query to find subscriptions where `RatePlan.ChargedThroughDate` is populated but no related invoice exists yet.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Catch Up Bill Run Identification"}
{"instruction":"Is there a comprehensive file of US Tax Rates available for import into the Zuora Tax Engine?","response":"A file exists that includes a single sales tax rate for each state/territory, but it is not comprehensive regarding product category specific taxes or local taxes.","category":"Definitional","topic":"US Tax Rates Import"}
{"instruction":"How can I report subscription metrics like TCV and ACV in the home currency if the subscription is in a different currency?","response":"You can use Data Query to join the subscription data with the `fxcustomrate` table (assuming exchange rates are loaded). You can then calculate the converted amount by multiplying the subscription TCV/ACV by the exchange rate.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Reporting Currency Conversion"}
{"instruction":"Does migrating a tenant (e.g., NA to NA) or cloning data preserve object IDs?","response":"No, if using Global Services or API-based extraction and import, object IDs will change. History (subscription history, invoices) is also typically not reloaded.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Tenant Migration IDs"}
{"instruction":"Can a Workflow be scheduled to run just once (e.g., ad hoc for tomorrow)?","response":"There is no native 'run once' schedule option. Workarounds include scheduling it yearly and manually unscheduling it later, having the workflow update itself via API to unschedule, or using a data flag (e.g., on a custom object) to control execution.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Workflow Scheduling"}
{"instruction":"What are the options for replicating Zuora data to an external system (initial load vs. ongoing)?","response":"For initial loads, use Aqua or Data Query. For ongoing near real-time replication, use Events and Callouts. Be aware that Zuora can generate transactions faster than some systems can consume, so middleware for queueing/back-pressure is recommended. Callouts are 'best efforts' and have no SLA.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Data Replication"}
{"instruction":"How do we migrate a customer off of Invoice Settlement?","response":"This type of migration is handled by the Zuora Product team.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Invoice Settlement Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can I add new custom fields to the Configurable Summary Level GL Interface if they weren't created before the app was installed?","response":"In API mode, the interface is restricted to predefined fields. You may need to file a ticket with Product & Tech or Support to resolve this. File-based mode offers more flexibility.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"GL Interface Custom Fields"}
{"instruction":"How can I speed up a Bill Run processing 1.1M subscriptions where only a small fraction generate invoices?","response":"The bill run examines all accounts with charges where `ChargedThroughDate` is on or before the target date. To improve performance, split accounts into batches and run multiple bill runs in parallel.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Bill Run Performance"}
{"instruction":"How do I prevent invoices created by a Catch Up Bill Run (CUBR) during an O2R migration from being taxed and sent to a tax vendor?","response":"Tax calculation is usually disabled during the CUBR process and re-enabled afterward. The Open Balance migration typically handles the tax items, so the CUBR invoices themselves do not need to generate tax.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Migration Tax Handling"}
{"instruction":"How can I download or upload files larger than 5MB to Google Drive via Workflow?","response":"You can use the Google Drive API directly (e.g., `GET ...?alt=media` for download). However, Workflow has a 5MB payload limit. Operations involving files larger than 5MB will fail if the file data is loaded into the workflow payload. You must process data in streams or chunks without loading the full file into the context if possible.","category":"Technical","topic":"Workflow Google Drive Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can we drive accounting code derivation based on both tax code and state (e.g., different GL for UT vs PA)?","response":"Yes, but it likely requires a Workflow triggered on bill run or invoice generation. The workflow would extract the account state and then update the `accountingCode` on the taxation item level.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Tax Accounting by State"}
{"instruction":"Is it necessary to have separate Accounts per currency (e.g., Account USD, Account EUR) with Flexible Billing?","response":"Generally no, unless there are specific limitations with downstream integrations like CPQ X or Billing-Revenue Integration (K2) that currently require single-currency accounts.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Multi-currency Accounts"}
{"instruction":"How can I segregate GL payments by legal entity (e.g., Check-EntityA vs Check-EntityB) on a single tenant?","response":"You can create custom payment method types via the API. This allows you to define separate accounting codes for each custom payment method (e.g., 'Check-AP' and 'Check-LB'), enabling GL segregation by entity.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Custom Payment Methods for GL"}
{"instruction":"Can `PUT_WriteOffInvoice` override accounting codes?","response":"It is recommended to use the Enhanced Write Off permission, which allows for both revenue-impacting and non-revenue-impacting write-offs. This can be configured OOTB without needing to override accounting codes via API.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Invoice Write Off Accounting"}
{"instruction":"Where can I find the most up-to-date Swagger/OpenAPI file for Zuora APIs?","response":"You can download the OpenAPI 3.0 YAML file from the Zuora API Reference. Note that this file is not tenant-specific and will not include your custom fields.","category":"Definitional","topic":"API Definition File"}
{"instruction":"Why is the tax date on a Credit Memo (CM) sometimes set to the date of the original invoice item (e.g., a year ago)?","response":"Zuora maintains a `taxDate` for each item. When processing reversals or proration credits, Zuora often uses the tax date of the original invoice item to ensure consistency. This date should be mapped to the tax engine's determination date field (e.g., `TAX_DETERMINATION_DATE`).","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Tax Date Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Why can't I see the `CreditCardType` field on the PaymentMethod object in a Workflow Object Query?","response":"The `CreditCardType` field exists on the `PaymentMethod` object, not the `Payment` object. You must query the `PaymentMethod` object directly (e.g., `SELECT CreditCardType FROM PaymentMethod...`).","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Object Query Payment Method"}
{"instruction":"How can I set a subscription status to 'Pending Activation'?","response":"You can achieve this by skipping a trigger date on the Create Subscription order (e.g., setting Contract Effective Date but not Service Activation Date), provided the tenant is configured to require Service Activation.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Subscription Pending Activation"}
{"instruction":"Can we migrate the full history of subscription changes (versions) instead of just the current state?","response":"Yes, you can migrate history by creating a single order containing multiple order actions (e.g., Create, Add Product, Update Product) arranged chronologically with the correct effective dates.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Historical Subscription Migration"}
{"instruction":"Can we update accounting codes for a charge when creating a subscription via the Orders API using `chargeOverrides`?","response":"No, parameters like `accountReceivableAccountingCode` in `chargeOverrides` are only supported for Standalone Invoices, not for subscription charges via the Orders API.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Order API Accounting Codes"}
{"instruction":"How can I ensure tax is calculated on the invoice total rather than per line item to avoid rounding discrepancies (e.g., for Japan)?","response":"You can use the 'Redistribute Zuora Tax rounding differences' setting. This allows the system to sum item amounts by tax code and calculate tax on the total, rather than summing the tax calculated on each individual line.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Tax Rounding"}
{"instruction":"How do I fix 'User does not have permission to modify object definitions' errors when using Deployment Manager?","response":"The user executing the deployment on the target environment needs appropriate permissions, such as 'Platform Admin' or specific permissions to manage Custom Object definitions.

{"instruction":"Can I change the time that the Subscription Auto Renew job runs (default is 2am UTC)?","response":"Yes, you can change this in Billing Settings > Default Subscription and Order Settings > Subscription Auto Renew Job Type, by selecting 'Tenant Specified time'.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Subscription Renewal Time"}
{"instruction":"Can I format custom number fields (e.g., with commas and decimals) in the Zuora UI?","response":"No, unlike standard fields (like Unit Price), custom number fields do not currently support display formatting options in the UI.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Custom Field Formatting"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to set prices for many currencies (e.g., 27) across many charges?","response":"The best approach is to use the API to update the `ProductRatePlan`, which allows setting `ActiveCurrencies` and prices for multiple currencies (up to 50-100) in a single call.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Multi-currency Pricing Setup"}
{"instruction":"Can I set one product to be Tax Exclusive in one region and Tax Inclusive in another on the same Product Rate Plan?","response":"Yes, you can achieve this by overriding the tax inclusive/exclusive setting at the charge level when creating the Order.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Tax Inclusive Exclusive Override"}
{"instruction":"How can I bill a fixed total amount (e.g., $1000) in equal installments over a non-standard term (e.g., 13 months)?","response":"This is not supported out-of-the-box. A workaround is to create a single invoice for the total amount, leave it in draft, and then manually split it into the desired number of installment invoices.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Installment Billing"}
{"instruction":"Can I use a GitHub repository to manage Deployment Manager deployments?","response":"Yes, Deployment Manager supports integration with GitHub repositories, allowing for version control of tenant configurations.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Deployment Manager GitHub"}

{"instruction":"What is the quickest way to count records in an object (e.g., >10M) without using Data Query?","response":"For specific objects (Account, Subscription, Order, Payment, Invoice), you can use the `GET /search/object-statistics/object` API. For others, use a Data Source Export with `EXPORT ZOQL` (`POST /v1/object/export`). Data Query count queries typically time out on very large datasets.","category":"Technical","topic":"Object Record Count"}
{"instruction":"Is it safe to use the legacy Mass Order Entry tool for amendments when Orders Harmonization is enabled?","response":"No, it is not recommended or supported. The legacy tool is non-performant and does not support newer features. You should use the Data Loader with amendment import instead.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Mass Order Entry"}
{"instruction":"Can we limit free trials to one per credit card (even if emails differ)?","response":"There is no native prevention for this. While the Payment Method ID is unique per token, checking for duplicates requires custom logic (API/Workflow) and may face compliance (fingerprinting) or gateway limitations.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Free Trial Credit Card Limit"}
{"instruction":"How can I hide the 'Cancel' button in the Subscription UI to force users to use 'Create Order'?","response":"You can hide the button using Role Permissions (by removing the Cancel/Delete permission) or by using UI Property Controls if available.","category":"Procedural","topic":"UI Button Hiding"}
{"instruction":"How can I validate a customer's VAT ID before sending the account to Zuora?","response":"You can use APIs provided by tax vendors (like Sovos or Vertex) to pre-validate the ID in your upstream system (e.g., Salesforce). Zuora also allows passing values to the tax engine during invoice generation for validation.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"VAT ID Validation"}
{"instruction":"Can I set the `AccountsReceivableAccountingCode` on a Product Rate Plan Charge during creation via API?","response":"No, this field cannot be set during the initial creation. It must be updated subsequently using the Update API or Mass Updater.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"AR Accounting Code API"}
{"instruction":"How long does a Central Sandbox (CSBX) refresh typically take?","response":"The duration of a Central Sandbox refresh depends heavily on the data volume. While some estimates suggest 4-6 hours, actual times can range from 10 minutes up to several days. If the status appears stuck for an extended period, it is recommended to contact the internal cloud sandbox team (#csbx) for assistance.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"Is there a cost associated with Real-Time Reconciliation (RTR) for payment gateways?","response":"Based on implementation experience with gateways like Stripe, Adyen, and Braintree, there is typically no additional cost for Real-Time Reconciliation for customers.","category":"definitional","topic":"Real-Time Reconciliation"}
{"instruction":"How does Zuora Tax (Z-Tax) handle India taxation requiring multiple tax lines (e.g., State GST and Federal GST)?","response":"Z-Tax supports up to three tax items per invoice item. It matches the first record, but that single record can contain up to three distinct rates (e.g., CGST, SGST, IGST), allowing for the generation of multiple tax rows as required for India GST compliance.","category":"best_practice","topic":"India Taxation"}
{"instruction":"How can we sync state-level tax reporting to NetSuite when using Avalara in Zuora, given that the Jurisdiction field doesn't sync by default?","response":"Since the Jurisdiction field on the TaxationItem does not sync to NetSuite out-of-the-box, a recommended workaround is to use the `SoldTo.State` field or implement a rule in NetSuite that stamps the taxation item with the Sold-To state at the time of creation. This ensures consistent reporting even if contact information changes later.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"NetSuite Connector"}
{"instruction":"Why do Developer Tools or Data Loader report 'Ship To' fields as mandatory even when flexible billing is not enabled?","response":"This is a known cosmetic issue. The fields may be marked as mandatory in the template validation logic even if the tenant configuration (flexible billing) does not require them. These validation errors can typically be ignored or bypassed during the load process.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Developer Tools"}
{"instruction":"Where are custom FX rates stored and how can they be accessed via Data Query?","response":"Custom FX rates are stored in the `fxcustomrate` object. This object is visible in Data Query (DQ), but accessing it requires the Tenant/T9 permission to be enabled on the tenant.","category":"technical","topic":"FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"What causes the error 'The remove date should not be before the most recent invoice date' (Code: 58730030) during an amendment?","response":"This error occurs when attempting to amend or cancel a subscription with an effective date that precedes the end date of the last generated invoice. You cannot modify a subscription for a period that has already been billed. The effective date must be on or after the last invoiced date.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Amendments"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for handling credit memo sequencing in Spain (e.g., Telefonica)?","response":"For complex regional requirements like Spain, some enterprise customers (e.g., Telefonica) use partners to handle the generation of legal documents externally. While Zuora runs the bill runs, the actual invoice and credit memo document generation and sequencing are managed in a custom external system to ensure strict compliance with local authority rules.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Regional Compliance"}
{"instruction":"Is there a limit on the number of subscription versions or amendments?","response":"Yes, there is a hard limit of 1000 versions per subscription.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Limits"}
{"instruction":"Can multiple different Invoice Schedules be created in bulk via a single API call?","response":"No, it is currently not possible to create multiple distinct invoice schedules for different items in a single bulk API call.","category":"technical","topic":"Invoice Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora bill to 6 decimal places?","response":"Zuora generally rounds billing and invoice amounts to the currency's defined precision (usually 2 decimals). While rating can happen at a higher precision (e.g., fractional cents for usage), the final invoice amount will be rounded. If the requirement is for pricing/rating precision rather than final invoice display, specific rating options ('Round and determine a price for usage records individually') can support higher precision calculations before aggregation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Decimal Precision"}
{"instruction":"What constitutes a standard chargeback workflow in Zuora?","response":"A standard chargeback process typically involves unapplying the payment and creating an external refund to reverse the transaction. Complex actions like canceling subscriptions or reversing invoices are not part of the standard chargeback event; these should be handled via dunning processes or custom workflows if required.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Chargebacks"}
{"instruction":"What is the usage rating limit per billing period, and how can it be exceeded?","response":"The legacy rater has a default limit of 200,000 usage records per rate plan charge per billing period (configurable). To process higher volumes without this limit, it is recommended to use the Advanced Consumption Rater (Unbilled Usage), which does not impose this limit. This requires enabling the 'Unbilled Usage' feature and using supported charge models.","category":"technical","topic":"Usage Rating"}
{"instruction":"Do custom fields on Product Rate Plan Charges (PRPC) automatically migrate to Subscription charges?","response":"No, custom fields on PRPC do not automatically inherit or copy to Subscription charges during migration. You must explicitly map and populate `Charge.CustomField__c` in your migration templates (supported in Developer Tools Orders dictionary) to ensure these values carry over.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Why are there multiple export APIs (DQ, AQuA, DSE) and which should be used?","response":"The variety of export APIs is historical. Data Query (DQ) is powerful and supports complex joins but is more complex to use. Data Source Export (DSE) and AQuA are better suited for simple bulk exports. There are known parity issues where some objects exist in DQ but not AQuA/DSE. A project is underway to unify these sources, but for now, choice depends on the need for joins (use DQ) vs. bulk simplicity (use DSE/AQuA).","category":"comparison","topic":"Export APIs"}
{"instruction":"How can I amend a subscription charge that is part of an executed Invoice Schedule?","response":"You cannot update the quantity or amount of a charge once it is part of an active/executed Invoice Schedule. A workaround is to remove the charge and create a new one, though the new charge would need to be assigned to a new Invoice Schedule.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Schedules"}
{"instruction":"Why is the 'Deploy' button missing for the Vertex Tax Connector in the Marketplace?","response":"This is often a provisioning issue where the feature has not been fully enabled for the tenant. A support ticket is required to have the provisioning team rectify the configuration.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Marketplace Apps"}
{"instruction":"Can I add a new feature to an existing subscription without creating an order?","response":"No, adding a feature or product to an existing subscription must be done through an Order (Amendment).","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"What if an external system (e.g., SAP) cannot store the long Zuora Invoice ID (GUID) for payments?","response":"It is common for external systems to have character limits. Best practice is to create a custom field in the external system to store the Zuora GUID, or to store both the Invoice Number (shorter) and the GUID if possible, to ensure reliable matching for external payments.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integrations"}
{"instruction":"What are the risks of using Billing Schedules for Milestone Billing?","response":"Billing Schedules must be created via a separate call after the order. A significant limitation is that you cannot update the quantity or amount of an item once it is in a Billing Schedule (though you can remove it). Additionally, service periods on the generated invoices may appear unusual depending on the schedule dates.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing Schedules"}
{"instruction":"How far back can Workflow logs be viewed in Production?","response":"By default, retention may be shorter, but in Production, the cleanup policy can be configured to retain workflow run history for up to 90 days via Workflow settings.","category":"technical","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"Can a subscription be suspended without generating a credit memo?","response":"Yes, if the suspension is made effective as of the last billed-through date, no credit memo will be generated for the already billed period.","category":"procedural","topic":"Suspensions"}
{"instruction":"Does the NetSuite Connector support syncing tax data for Credit and Debit Memos?","response":"Yes, this is supported via the 'Inline Taxation for Invoices and Credit Memos' functionality. Ensure this feature is enabled and configured in the connector settings.","category":"technical","topic":"NetSuite Connector"}
{"instruction":"Can Flexible Billing attributes (custom fields on Subscriptions) be used in Tax Code formulas?","response":"No, this is currently a functional gap. Tax formulas generally only support standard fields and custom fields from the Account and SoldToContact objects. Subscription-level custom fields cannot be directly used to drive tax logic.","category":"limitation","topic":"Flexible Billing"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to report on orders that were rolled back due to failed payments?","response":"No, rolled-back transactions are not persisted in Zuora's database and thus are not available for reporting via standard data sources. Best practice is to log these attempts externally or to create cancellation orders to track the activity within Zuora.","category":"limitation","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora have a Terraform provider?","response":"There is no official Terraform provider yet, but an AOC (AOC-02253) exists for this request.","category":"technical","topic":"Terraform"}
{"instruction":"How can I resolve a OneID login loop where the page redirects repeatedly?","response":"This can happen when a password reset is required but the redirect fails due to browser caching. A known workaround is to open a different browser (or incognito window), log in to trigger the password reset flow, update the password, and then return to the original browser to log in.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"OneID"}
{"instruction":"How can we address proration rounding errors where customers lose cents?","response":"This is often 'working as designed' due to rounding precision logic. Options are limited: Engineering may address rounding precision in the long term, but immediate workarounds are difficult. Some customers audit invoices and apply small one-time charges to correct differences, though this is manual.","category":"limitation","topic":"Rounding"}
{"instruction":"Why does usage not appear on an invoice if the bill run target date is the last day of the month?","response":"This depends on the 'Billing Day' setting of the usage rate plan charge. If set to '1st of the month', the usage will only be picked up by a bill run dated the 1st of the next month. If set to 'End of Month', it should appear on a bill run targeting the last day of the month.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Billing"}
{"instruction":"Can multiple CPQ instances feed into a single Zuora Billing tenant without Multi-Entity?","response":"Yes, but it requires careful management of the 360 Sync. You will likely need a custom sync process to ensure that account and subscription data from Zuora is correctly routed back to the appropriate Salesforce instance.","category":"best_practice","topic":"CPQ Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can I report on Functional Currency without Multi-Org?","response":"Without Multi-Org, Zuora reports in the Home Currency. A workaround is to use a Workflow to export data and apply currency conversion logic during the export process, or to perform the conversion in an external data warehouse.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Do child accounts in a hierarchy sync to Salesforce automatically?","response":"Child accounts generally will not sync to Salesforce unless they have a CRM ID populated. If they were not created via CPQ, you may need to manually populate the CRM ID to trigger the sync.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora support deployment on Private Clouds?","response":"No, Zuora does not support private cloud deployments.","category":"definitional","topic":"Deployment"}
{"instruction":"When is a Custom Logic function triggered (Creation vs Update)?","response":"The UI for selecting specific trigger events (Create vs Update) has been removed. You must now include logic within the function code itself to determine when to execute (e.g., checking if a specific field is empty to detect a 'create' scenario).","category":"technical","topic":"Custom Logic"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora show bounced email notifications when using an external SMTP server (e.g., SendGrid)?","response":"If using an external SMTP server, bounce notifications typically do not route back to Zuora. You must check the logs of the external SMTP provider (e.g., SendGrid) to view bounce information.","category":"technical","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"How can I restrict specific currencies to specific Orgs in a Multi-Org environment if the Product Catalog is shared?","response":"Since the Product Catalog is shared across Orgs, you can use Custom Logic on the Subscription object to validate the currency at the time of creation. The logic can block subscription creation if the currency does not match the allowed list for the user's current Org.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"How can we combine the usage of two products (e.g., Product X and Product Y) for overage purposes where a customer commits to a total unit count across both?","response":"To achieve this, the customer would need to pay upfront. You can then link both usage Units of Measure (UOMs) to the same drawdown or prepaid UOM.","category":"procedural","topic":"Usage Billing"}
{"instruction":"In CPQX, is there a setting to automatically invoke a bill run when an order is submitted from Salesforce, similar to the runbilling = true option in the Order API?","response":"Yes, on the quote before sending it to Zuora, there is a check/flag labeled \"Generate Invoice\" that triggers this behavior.","category":"procedural","topic":"CPQX"}
{"instruction":"Can a payment run be configured to use a specific credit card payment method for an account that has wire transfer set as the default, specifically to ensure surcharges are applied?","response":"Yes, you can use the \"Custom Payment Run\" functionality via the POST PaymentRun API. In the data field of the payload, you can specify the paymentMethodId for each specific accountId. Note that the targetDate in the payload must be set beyond the Due Date of the invoice (not the created date) for the payment to be picked up. While creating a payment directly (outside a run) allows picking a method, using the Payment Run API is necessary if you need surcharges to apply.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Runs"}
{"instruction":"Is there a specific setting required to submit a quote for Order Line Items (OLI) only in CPQX?","response":"No specific setting is required; submitting a quote with only OLI is supported out-of-the-box and should work without issues. If submitting fails, check for specific errors rather than configuration settings.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"CPQX"}
{"instruction":"At what time of day does the \"Upcoming Renewal\" notification event trigger? Does it respect the tenant's timezone?","response":"The default time for auto-renewals (and associated upcoming renewal events) is typically 01:00 (1 AM) for the scheduler, irrespective of the specific data center or tenant timezone.","category":"definitional","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Why don't payments and refunds inherit the numbering sequence set assigned at the subscription level when using Flexible Billing, unlike billing documents?","response":"This is a known inconsistency. Payments are generally linked to the Account, not the Subscription (unless Payment Profiles are used). A single payment or payment run can cover multiple invoices from different subscriptions (which might have different sequence sets), making a 1:1 link impossible. The sequence set configuration includes prefixes for payments/refunds, which causes confusion when Flexible Billing attributes are used at the sub level.","category":"definitional","topic":"Flexible Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can we send a Hosted Payment Method (HPM) link to a specific customer to capture their payment method after a contract/subscription is created, specifically for sales-led CPQX customers who don't log in?","response":"This requires a custom solution involving Salesforce development. The recommended flow is: (1) CPQX/Salesforce generates a unique link for the customer account that redirects to a client-hosted page embedding Zuora's HPM. (2) Store this link in a custom field on the Zuora Account via API. (3) Trigger a notification from Zuora containing this link. (4) The customer clicks the link, enters details on the HPM, and the Payment Method is saved to the Zuora account.","category":"best_practice","topic":"HPM Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement a \"Price Lock\" or pre-negotiated price for future purchases that a customer isn't buying yet but wants on the order form for later use?","response":"There is no out-of-the-box \"Contract Pricing\" feature currently available to handle this. A potential workaround is using a sidebar component or custom UI to manage these prices, but challenges arise regarding versioning and handling price changes/uplifts during the contract term.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Pricing Strategy"}
{"instruction":"Can Order Line Items (OLIs) be billed to a different invoice owner, similar to how subscriptions can have a specific invoice owner?","response":"Yes, there is an option for \"Invoice Owner Transfer\" during OLI creation that allows specifying a different owner for billing.","category":"procedural","topic":"Order Line Items"}
{"instruction":"How can we display a dollar amount as a percentage (e.g., usage percentage) in HTML invoice templates?","response":"You can use JavaScript within the HTML template. Insert a placeholder div and a script that converts the number: return (num / 100).toLocaleString(undefined, { style: 'percent' }).","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"Can the \"Single-Subscription Version\" feature be enabled for a tenant that already has existing transaction data or versioned subscriptions?","response":"No, the Single-Subscription Version feature is generally intended for new, clean tenants. It cannot be enabled if the tenant already has transaction data or existing subscriptions.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"Why does an advanced bill run filter scan all accounts even when a specific subscription filter is provided?","response":"The system filter logic proceeds hierarchically from Account -> Subscription -> Charge. If no Account Filter is specified, the system picks up *all* accounts with charges to be billed before checking the Subscription filter. To optimize, you must start with an Account filter.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Bill Runs"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to add or remove a specific charge from a subscription without removing the entire rate plan?","response":"Adding a specific charge to an existing rate plan is supported via the \"charge subset\" feature (adding optional charges) using the Update Product Order Action via API. However, removing a specific charge from a rate plan (without removing the plan) is currently a limitation and is not supported.","category":"procedural","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to generate both a PDF invoice and a PEPPOL XML file for the same billing document within Zuora?","response":"Yes, PDF and XML generation are independent processes, so you can generate both to satisfy requirements for emailing a PDF and delivering an XML to the PEPPOL network.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"What is the limit on the number of versions a subscription can have, and what are the implications of high version counts?","response":"The limit is typically 1001 versions (1000 amendments). High version counts can lead to performance degradation. For use cases requiring frequent updates (e.g., every bill cycle), consider using the \"Single-Subscription Version\" feature if it is a new tenant.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"When is it recommended to use Dynamic Usage Charges over standard Subscriptions in Zuora?","response":"Use Subscriptions for ongoing relationships with predictable billing cycles, customer lifecycle management (upgrades/renewals), and recurring fees. Use Dynamic Usage Charges for usage-based or pay-as-you-go models where there is no fixed recurring fee, for stand-alone billing tied to an account without a product subscription, or for sporadic one-off charges.","category":"comparison","topic":"Usage Billing"}
{"instruction":"How can a workflow be triggered immediately after a successful Foreign Exchange (FX) Rates import?","response":"The \"Import Processed\" event does not support callouts. The recommended approach is to have the customer add a step to their integration to explicitly trigger the Zuora Workflow via API immediately after the FX import is complete. Alternatively, use an SFTP drop triggering a workflow if supported.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"Is the Invoice Item Adjustments (IIA) feature going End of Support (EOS) or being discontinued in 2026?","response":"No, IIA is not being discontinued. While documentation may confusingly reference \"Maintenance Mode\" or EOS, the plan to discontinue it was reverted. Customers can continue to use it, though it will not receive new features.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can we hide sensitive information like credit card details from specific users (e.g., customer service agents) while allowing them to see subscriptions and invoices?","response":"Credit card numbers are already masked by default. For further data protection, Zuora Protect (a paid feature in Early Access) can be used to enable platform encryption and manage data visibility.","category":"procedural","topic":"Security"}
{"instruction":"Can a Custom Object have a relationship field linking to a custom field on a standard object (like a Product Rate Plan Charge)?","response":"No. Custom Object relationship fields can only map to the ID of a standard object (e.g., PRPC.Id), not to custom fields on that object. Additionally, relationships are designed as Many-to-One; you cannot create a relationship linking to a custom field.","category":"definitional","topic":"Custom Objects"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to query for unbilled usage charges to identify missed billing or anticipated billing?","response":"You should query the RatingResult table where status = 'Rated'.","category":"procedural","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to connect two separate Salesforce instances (one using CPQ/360, one using API) to a single Zuora tenant?","response":"Yes, it is possible but complex. It typically involves custom API integrations (GET/POST) to sync data, often using the Orders API to interface the non-CPQ Salesforce instance with Zuora.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can a single line item on a customer invoice be split into multiple accounting codes (e.g., 85% to Account A, 15% to Account B) on the backend?","response":"Zuora requires that each Charge maps to a specific GL account. To achieve the split, you must configure the Rate Plan with multiple separate charges (e.g., Charge 1 for 85%, Charge 2 for 15%) each mapped to the respective Chart of Accounts. To present this as a \"single line\" to the customer, you would need to group these charges on the Invoice PDF template logic.","category":"procedural","topic":"Accounting Integration"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora support the new tokenization framework for Credit Cards with Adyen, or is it legacy?","response":"Currently, Zuora's integration with Adyen uses the legacy tokenization model for Credit Cards (storing TokenId and SecondTokenId on the PaymentMethod object), whereas ACH/SEPA use the new framework. Enabling \"Submit card payments with RecurringDetailReference\" may cause issues if the gateway configuration does not match the token/PAN data being passed.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"How can we link failed payment attempts to invoices using Data Query?","response":"You can link them by joining Invoice, PaymentApplication, and Payment. Use the query: SELECT i.InvoiceNumber, i.Amount, ARRAY_AGG(p.effectivedate ORDER BY p.effectivedate) AS Failed_Payment_Attempts FROM Invoice i LEFT JOIN PaymentApplication pa ON pa.invoiceid = i.id JOIN Payment p ON p.id = pa.paymentid AND p.status = 'Error' AND p.type = 'Electronic' GROUP BY 1,2.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Query"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora store the JSON request bodies for REST API callouts for debugging purposes?","response":"No, Zuora generally does not store request bodies for API calls due to security and scalability reasons.","category":"definitional","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommendation regarding using event-based notifications for large-scale data integrations between Billing and other systems?","response":"Zuora does not recommend using event-based notifications for large-scale data integrations. Instead, use scheduled, pull-based integrations via AQUA or Data Query. These offer better reliability, error handling, and performance at scale.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can Avalara be configured to use the \"Ship To\" address at the Subscription level instead of the Account \"Sold To\"?","response":"Yes, this happens automatically if you turn off Flexible Billing Attributes (FBA). If a Ship To is present, the connector uses it; otherwise, it defaults to Sold To.","category":"procedural","topic":"Taxes"}
{"instruction":"How can we extract a list of all custom fields to compare between environments?","response":"You can use the Settings API: GET /settings/custom-fields/zuora.

{"instruction":"Can we access the Journal Entry transaction detail tables (e.g., JournalEntryDetailInvoiceItem) via Data Query?","response":"No, these tables are exposed in Data Source exports but not in Data Query. To analyze this data via query, you must either export via Data Source and load into an external DB/Custom Object, or write queries against the source transactional objects (InvoiceItem, Payment, etc.) which contain journalentryid fields.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Finance"}
{"instruction":"Why does creating a custom event on the RatePlanCharge object fail when comparing a field against a constant/static value?","response":"There is a documented limitation: \"When creating custom events, you cannot match fields of the RatePlanCharge object against constant values for the condition field.\"","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Custom Events"}
{"instruction":"How can we set up a Workflow callout to NetSuite (NetSuiteTBA) for sending summary journals?","response":"You can configure the callout using global parameters for credentials. There is an existing workflow template \"Netsuite Integration\" available that demonstrates this setup.","category":"procedural","topic":"NetSuite Integration"}
{"instruction":"When implementing a GoCardless one-time payment flow, why might we get an \"Insufficient Dynamic params error: missing accountId\" error during the RSA signature generation?","response":"This often happens because the Zuora Account must exist before the Payment Method can be created or signed for in certain flows. If the account ID is not passed or created prior to the RSA signature call, the gateway cannot link the mandate.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"How can we display the 3-character currency code (e.g., \"GBP\") next to an amount in an HTML invoice template?","response":"You can use the merge field {{Account.Currency}} to display the currency code.","category":"procedural","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement an \"Even Billing\" or \"Enterprise Agreement\" model where a Parent pays a fixed monthly amount (e.g., $1M) and Child accounts burn down this balance?","response":"This is complex. Suggestions include: (1) Prepaid Drawdown (works best for usage, limits rev rec visibility). (2) Prepaid Cash with Drawdown (pays for child subs but doesn't invoice parent easily). (3) Workflow creating Credit Memos from the parent's payment to apply to child invoices (requires \"Payment Cross Accounts\" feature).","category":"best_practice","topic":"Enterprise Billing"}
{"instruction":"If a tenant has Invoice Settlement (IS) enabled, is it normal to still see Invoice Settlement Harmonization (ISH) objects (like InvoiceItemAdjustment)?","response":"Yes, if the tenant was migrated from ISH to IS, historical ISH objects may still be visible. However, legacy objects like InvoiceAdjustment should be deprecated/hidden.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"Why does the 3DS prompt show an amount of 0 (e.g., £0) instead of the actual transaction amount when using Stripe v2?","response":"This is a known behavior of the Stripe v2 integration. The amount configured or specified for validation in the payment form web session is ignored for the 3DS challenge display in some flows, often defaulting to an authorization check of 0.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payments"}
{"instruction":"If a Bill Run fails to post invoices (leaving them in DRAFT) due to a tax engine timeout, is there an automatic retry mechanism?","response":"There is no automatic retry to \"post\" draft invoices that failed during a bill run. The invoices must be posted manually or picked up by a subsequent bill run (if configured).","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Bill Runs"}
{"instruction":"Can we bill a customer upfront for a subscription but split the total amount into two invoices with different payment terms (e.g., $5k Due Upon Receipt, $15k Net 90)?","response":"Payment terms are set at the Invoice level. To achieve this, you must generate two separate invoices. This can be done by setting the term on the account, generating Invoice 1, then changing the term, and generating Invoice 2.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"Is there a versioned URL for Payment Form hosted scripts (like zuora.js) to support SRI integrity hashing without breaking when Zuora updates the script?","response":"No, there is currently no interim solution or versioned URL for Payment Forms scripts. A product enhancement is in development to address this.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Forms"}
{"instruction":"Is CSS styling customization supported for Zuora Payment Forms?","response":"No, CSS customization is not supported for Payment Forms, and product teams have indicated no immediate plans to enable it.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Forms"}
{"instruction":"Are there reference implementations or examples for integrating Zuora with external monitoring systems like Splunk or Dynatrace?","response":"There are no pre-baked OOTB integrations. Customers typically build this using a combination of the Audit Trail and System Health APIs.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integration"}
{"instruction":"What are some use cases for Order Line Items (OLIs) and has anyone successfully implemented them for hardware or digital fulfillment?","response":"Order Line Items (OLIs) are used for non-subscription items. A cited use case involves Reuters News & Media using OLIs for licensing real-time image feeds (Single Asset Licensing). Other customers, such as Xylem and game publishers, considered OLIs for hardware or digital key fulfillment but often encountered complexity in setup or external requirements that prevented implementation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Order Line Items (OLI)"}
{"instruction":"How can I report on ACH payments or Payment Methods specifically in Grafana?","response":"You can use the Telemetry Metrics dashboards. For payments (filtering by method type ACH), use the payment dashboard URL (e.g., `.../goto/NL-QHaqHk?orgId=1`). For a breakdown of payment methods, use the Payment Method Dashboard (e.g., `.../d/HU6fRtdVz/payment-method-dashboard?orgId=1`).","category":"procedural","topic":"Reporting / Grafana"}
{"instruction":"Why would a customer see a high volume of Credit Memos, sometimes exceeding Invoice values in a month, when using Invoice Settlement?","response":"This can occur due to specific use cases like high-value cancellations mid-month. For example, if a customer cancels a high-value plan ($500) and keeps a low-value plan ($100), the system generates a large proration credit. Depending on the 'Credit Memo Generation Rule' in billing settings, these negative amounts may generate separate Credit Memos rather than netting off against the invoice, potentially causing Credit Memo volumes to exceed Invoice volumes for that period.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"#zuora_sa"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle the 'limbo' window between subscription expiration at midnight and the auto-renewal job execution (e.g., 2 AM), where customers might accidentally re-subscribe as new?","response":"The recommended approach is to implement application-side logic to block purchase capabilities for active or renewing subscribers during this window. Alternatively, move the auto-renewal job execution to midnight to close the gap. While running renewal and scheduled order jobs (for price uplifts) in parallel is possible, sequential execution is generally safer to avoid processing conflicts. Adding warning text to renewal emails about processing delays is also suggested.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Auto-Renewal"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora have pre-built connectors for procurement platforms like Coupa or Ariba to ingest Purchase Orders?","response":"No, there are currently no pre-built connectors for Coupa or Ariba. Integration typically requires custom configuration involving field matching and CSV uploads. Product teams are tracking this capability for future inclusion in Zuora Collections (Growfin).","category":"comparison","topic":"Integrations / Procurement"}
{"instruction":"Can pop-up blockers interfere with 3DS2 verification flows?","response":"Yes, if the 3D Secure (3DS) challenge is presented in a pop-up window rather than an iframe, aggressive ad blockers can block the verification window, preventing successful payment processing.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payments / 3DS2"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement a percentage uplift charge (e.g., 20% service fee) on a total invoice?","response":"Currently, the primary options are using a negative discount or calculating an absolute amount externally. A 'Calculated Charge Model' feature is planned for release (Early Access in Q4). Workarounds include generating a draft invoice to calculate the fee, then adding it as a usage/OLI charge, or using a frontend/CPQ process to calculate the fixed amount before sending the order to Zuora.","category":"procedural","topic":"Charge Models"}
{"instruction":"What is a recommended strategy for grouping countries into Vertex tax templates for international expansion?","response":"A pragmatic approach involves grouping by tax regime. For example: Template 1 for Destination-based tax (US, Canada), Template 2 for VAT/GST countries (Australia, UK, Germany, etc.), and Template 3 for unique regimes like Brazil. However, consider keeping EU countries separate or using Zuora Tax if simpler. If using Vertex for EU, verify it supports 'Reverse Charge' for B2B tax-free selling, which Zuora's native tax solution does not handle OOTB. The selling entity location is critical for configuration.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Tax / Vertex"}
{"instruction":"Is there an available connector for Microsoft Dynamics 365?","response":"Yes, Zuora offers a Revenue Bi-Directional Connector for Microsoft Dynamics 365.","category":"definitional","topic":"Connectors / Microsoft Dynamics"}
{"instruction":"How can I resolve tax rounding discrepancies when creating multiple manual credit memos against a single invoice?","response":"Discrepancies occur because tax is calculated individually on each Credit Memo. To resolve, ensure 'Tax Auto Calculation' is enabled for all Credit Memos. You may need to use 'Tax Inclusive' mode for the final credit memo or manually adjust amounts to ensure the cumulative tax matches the original invoice exactly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Taxation / Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora support detailed transaction-level integration to Workday (e.g., invoice item level) instead of just Journal Entries?","response":"Yes, some customers (e.g., Veradigm) have implemented detailed transaction-level integrations to Workday, going beyond simple Journal Entry summaries.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Integrations / Workday"}
{"instruction":"How can we update existing Foreign Exchange (FX) rates in Zuora?","response":"You cannot update existing FX rate records directly via Mass Updater (it will error on duplicates). The standard solution is to delete the existing rates and re-upload the corrected ones. Support can assist in deleting rates for a specific period if needed.","category":"procedural","topic":"FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"Why would a user with correct permissions be unable to see all API options in Developer Tools?","response":"This is often a provisioning issue where the tenant or user is not correctly entitled to the Developer Tools feature. Checking with the Provisioning team is recommended.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Developer Tools"}
{"instruction":"Does spacing matter in Workflow batch parameters (e.g., '6, 21' vs '6,21')?","response":"Yes, spacing matters. It is recommended to use comma-separated values without spaces (e.g., '6,21') to ensure the parameters are read correctly.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"What are the impacts of enabling Invoice Item Settlement on the data model and reporting?","response":"Enabling Invoice Item Settlement changes the underlying data model. Journal Runs will use new transaction types (`Electronic Payment Application Item` vs `Electronic Payment Application`), significantly increasing Journal Entry volume. The `PaymentApplication.JournalEntryId` field stops being populated, replaced by `PaymentApplicationItem.JournalEntryId`, which breaks existing AQuA queries filtering by Journal Run on the old object.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Item Settlement"}
{"instruction":"Can a workflow trigger be filtered to run only if an invoice contains a specific charge?","response":"No, you cannot filter by specific charge at the Workflow Trigger level. You must trigger the workflow on the Invoice object and then add a condition task as the first step to check the invoice items and stop execution if the specific charge is not found.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"How can we implement a 'Maximum Charge' cap (e.g., $60k annual limit) for a customer?","response":"Zuora does not have a native 'Cap' feature similar to Minimum Commit. This requires a custom solution, often involving Commitments and Workflows to track usage and discount/zero-out charges once the cap is hit. Some customers have implemented this via heavy customization.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing Logic"}
{"instruction":"Can Product & Engineering perform a complete 'factory reset' or data wipe of a Sandbox?","response":"There is an official Workflow available to clean up transactional data (accounts, subs), but it does not reset reference data like the Product Catalog or settings. A true 'fresh start' often requires this workflow followed by manual cleanup steps.","category":"procedural","topic":"Sandbox Management"}
{"instruction":"How can I override the accounting code for tax items on a Credit Memo?","response":"The system often recalculates tax and reverts accounting codes to default upon posting a Credit Memo. To handle write-offs with specific accounting codes, use the 'Enhanced Write Off' process which allows specifying accounting codes during the write-off action, rather than manually creating a Credit Memo.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Credit Memos / Accounting Codes"}
{"instruction":"Is there a direct relationship or ID link between Zuora Contacts and Salesforce Contacts?","response":"There is no direct link between the core Salesforce `Contact` object and Zuora Contacts. The Zuora 360 Sync package includes a `Zuora__ZContact__c` object, but it is not the standard Contact object. CPQ logic matches contacts based on algorithms (names, etc.) rather than strict ID matching.","category":"definitional","topic":"Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction":"How do I cancel a draft invoice using the API or Workflow?","response":"You can use the old CRUD API to update the invoice status to 'Cancelled', or use the undocumented endpoint `PUT /v1/invoices/{invoiceKey}/cancel`. The v2 API is not supported for this action within Workflow.","category":"procedural","topic":"API / Invoices"}
{"instruction":"Why do Payment Links fail with the 'Test Gateway' error when using an Adyen test gateway?","response":"This error can occur if the 'Payment Form' feature is not enabled for the Payment Link. Ensure you are using the Payment Form version of the feature, as legacy versions have stricter limitations regarding test gateways.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Payment Links"}
{"instruction":"How can I rename report columns to remove the 'Object Name:' prefix for client exports?","response":"The most effective method is to use a Workflow with a 'CSV Create' task to rename the headers during file generation. Native reporting always includes the object prefix (or alias), even when using Data Query.","category":"procedural","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Can a single Salesforce product support multiple billing frequencies (e.g., Monthly and Annual) when syncing to Zuora?","response":"Yes, this can be achieved by setting the Zuora Product Catalog charge 'List Price Base' to 'Per Month' instead of 'Per Billing Period'. This allows the connector to calculate the correct price regardless of the billing frequency selected on the Salesforce Quote.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Salesforce CPQ"}
{"instruction":"How do I resolve 'lock competition' errors when applying payments immediately after order creation via API?","response":"This error (`v1/payments/.../apply` failed) occurs due to concurrency if the invoice or payment is still being processed/locked by the creation call. Implementing a retry logic (e.g., 3 retries spaced 3 seconds apart) for the apply call is a proven solution.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"API / Payments"}
{"instruction":"Where is the 'Change Reason' field from the Orders UI stored?","response":"It is stored in `OrderAction.ChangeReason`. It is a free-form field that copies to `Subscription.cancelReason` if the action is a cancellation. It is not a custom field on the Subscription object.","category":"definitional","topic":"Orders / Data Model"}
{"instruction":"How can I terminate a Rate Plan Charge without performing a full removal action?","response":"If the subscription or order is in Draft status, you can update the Rate Plan Charge's `EndDateCondition` directly via the API. For active subscriptions, a standard Rate Plan Update/Remove order action is required.","category":"procedural","topic":"Orders"}
{"instruction":"Can Zuora merge multiple invoice PDFs into a single file for dunning?","response":"No, Zuora does not natively merge PDF files. You would need to use a Workflow with an external service (like AWS Lambda) to merge them. Alternatively, you can use the 'Account Summary Statement' feature to generate a single document summarizing the invoices, but this is a new document, not a merge of existing PDFs.","category":"capability","topic":"Invoices / PDF"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended process for handling chargebacks where the merchant wins the dispute?","response":"The standard flow starts with Gateway Reconciliation creating an External Refund. If the dispute is won, the best practice is to create a new External Payment and apply it to the invoice. Simply undoing the refund is often not supported by downstream ERP integrations.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payments / Chargebacks"}
{"instruction":"Is customer data encrypted at rest in Zuora Billing?","response":"Yes, customer data is encrypted at rest. Credit card data is encrypted via HSMs, and data in AWS is encrypted via AWS KMS, compliant with SOC 1 Type 2 standards.","category":"security","topic":"Security"}
{"instruction":"How can I trigger a workflow when an agent manually emails an invoice from the UI?","response":"The native 'Email' button does not trigger a workflow event. You should disable the native button permissions and replace it with a custom UI button that invokes a Workflow to send the email and perform any additional required logic.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow / UI"}
{"instruction":"Does Zuora support ZUGFeRD or xInvoice e-invoicing formats?","response":"Zuora does not natively support ZUGFeRD. It supports **Peppol BIS Billing 3.0**, which is a compliant format in Germany and other regions. ZUGFeRD is a distinct format.","category":"capability","topic":"E-Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"How can I update Product Rate Plan Charge pricing for multiple currencies using Data Loader?","response":"The standard 'Update Product Rate Plan Charge' template often fails for multi-currency updates. The recommended approach is to use the `Product Rate Plan Charge Tier` object. First, query `ProductRatePlanChargeTier` to get Tier IDs and Currencies, then use Data Loader to update the `Price` field on the `Product Rate Plan Charge Tier` object using those IDs.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Loader / Pricing"}
{"instruction":"How can I prevent multiple instances of a workflow from running concurrently for the same account?","response":"You can add a custom logic step (e.g., a query loop) at the beginning of the workflow to check if another instance is currently running for the same entity ID and block or delay execution until it clears.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Workflow"}
{"instruction":"What are the risks of changing the API Name of an existing Custom Field?","response":"Changing the API Name will break any existing integrations, Data Query scripts, or exports that reference that field. It is highly risky. The recommended best practice is to create a new custom field with the desired name instead.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Fields"}
{"instruction":"What happens to SEPA mandates if we migrate from GoCardless to Stripe?","response":"Since SEPA mandates are tokenized by the gateway, you cannot simply switch the gateway in Zuora. You must migrate the mandate data (tokens) between the gateways (GoCardless to Stripe) and then recreate the Payment Methods in Zuora to reference the new Stripe customer/payment tokens.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Payments / Migration"}
{"instruction":"Why doesn't the Flexible Billing Attribute 'Sold To' contact appear on the Invoice header?","response":"This is expected behavior. When Flexible Billing Attributes are used, the subscription-level Sold To contact is stamped on the **Invoice Items**, not the Invoice Header. The Invoice Header retains the Invoice Owner's default contact.","category":"definitional","topic":"Flexible Billing"}
{"instruction":"Is SCIM support available for Zuora OneID?","response":"Yes, SCIM v2 API is available for provisioning OneID. Additional integration for syncing role assignments from Entra ID is also in development.","category":"capability","topic":"SSO / OneID"}
{"instruction":"Why are there field inconsistencies between v1 APIs and Object Query (e.g., missing productSku)?","response":"These inconsistencies are due to the different ages and underlying technologies of the APIs (v1 is older, Object Query is newer). While there is no plan for a global refactor to align them, specific missing fields in Object Query can often be added by raising a support request (L3 ticket).","category":"definitional","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"How can I update multi-attribute pricing mid-term for a subscription?","response":"To update attributes that drive pricing formulas mid-term, you must perform an order action to remove the existing Rate Plan and add a new Rate Plan with the updated attributes.","category":"procedural","topic":"Pricing"}
{"instruction":"How do I retrieve `orderactionrateplan` charges in Data Query?","response":"There is no direct `OrderActionRatePlanCharge` object. You must join/drill down from `OrderActionRatePlan` to `RatePlan`, and then to `RatePlanCharge` to access the charge details.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Query"}
{"instruction":"I'm receiving a \"RenewalSetting is required\" error when calling the v1/orders API, even though the field is present in my request body. What could be the cause?","response":"This error message can be misleading. In past cases, this specific error has occurred when the `Idempotency-Key` parameter was included in the header. Try removing the `Idempotency-Key` from the header to see if the call succeeds.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"v1/orders API Error"}
{"instruction":"I am unable to access the Users section under Administration in my personal sandbox. How can I retrieve my OAuth credentials if I can't navigate to the user page?","response":"If the UI is unresponsive or inaccessible, you can try accessing the user page directly via a URL workaround. Use the following format: `https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/UserLogin.do?method=view&id=INSERT_ID_HERE`, replacing `INSERT_ID_HERE` with your user ID. Note that the API Sandbox UI can be very slow.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox User Access"}
{"instruction":"When are OANDA FX rates populated in Zuora Billing, and what is the lookback period?","response":"Zuora Billing usually pulls OANDA rates once a day. OANDA publishes one FX rate per currency pair per day, ending at 22:00 UTC on the previous day. The lookback period is typically 1 or 2 days in the past.","category":"Definitional","topic":"OANDA Rates"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to automate Snowflake key rotation via a scheduled workflow that creates a ticket? Does Zuora Support accept ticket creation via email?","response":"Yes, Zuora Support confirmed that tickets can be raised by sending an email to the support email address. You can configure a workflow to send this email automatically for key rotation requests.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Snowflake Key Rotation"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended approach for setting up milestone-based billing for professional services?","response":"The recommended approach is to use the \"Billing Schedule\" feature. While it can be manual, it is built specifically to handle milestone billing scenarios where invoices are generated after certain milestones are hit.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Milestone Billing"}
{"instruction":"Can we use the Split Invoice feature to invoice multiple parties (e.g., Company B and C) for a contract held by Company A?","response":"No, Zuora does not natively support multi-party agreements where a single contract is split-invoiced to different legal entities directly. The contract is between Zuora and Party A. The Split Invoice feature is intended for different use cases. The standard recommendation is to invoice Party A, who is then responsible for invoicing Parties B and C. Creating standalone invoices for B and C and a credit memo for A is not a recommended workaround.","category":"Comparison","topic":"Split Invoicing Multi-Party"}
{"instruction":"I am getting a \"Data exceeds the size limit of 5 MB\" error in a Workflow Invoice Data Export task. Can this limit be increased?","response":"The 5 MB limit on workflow tasks is generally not waived. To resolve this, you need to narrow down your Data Query (DQ) to return fewer records or split the processing into smaller batches.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Workflow Size Limit"}
{"instruction":"What is the strategy and expected duration for an Invoice Settlement (IS) migration with large data volumes?","response":"Migrations for large volumes (e.g., millions of subscriptions) can take a significant amount of time, potentially requiring a weekend blackout period. However, a newer approach allows for background \"silent\" payment migration to occur before the full IS migration, which minimizes downtime. Engineering can also filter by payment effective date to migrate selective history.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Invoice Settlement Migration"}
{"instruction":"Why would usage records be left as separate unrated records on an account despite having a valid Subscription Number and Charge Number?","response":"This often happens if the dates or Unit of Measure (UOM) on the usage records do not align with the rate plan charge, or if the usage falls into periods that have already been rated/billed.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Records Not Rating"}
{"instruction":"How do I setup a subscription so the first invoice is prorated until the end of the year, for a yearly subscription starting on September 1st?","response":"Create the subscription with a start date of January 1st, and then immediately update the term start date to September 1st (01/09). Ensure charges are aligned to the subscription start. This aligns the billing periods such that the first invoice covers Sept-Dec.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Prorated First Invoice"}
{"instruction":"Can users modify subscriptions or limits in a \"read-only\" tenant?","response":"Yes. A \"read-only\" tenant is a commercial concept indicating no purchased volume (utilization should stay at 0), but it is not a technical restriction. Users still have full technical capabilities to modify data via UI or API.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Read-Only Tenant"}
{"instruction":"Is it an issue if a US-based entity (transacting in USD) collects taxes in Europe via a tax engine (e.g., Vertex) for customers with European billing addresses?","response":"This setup is generally fine as long as the VAT amount is correctly tracked and displayed on the invoice.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Cross-border Taxation"}
{"instruction":"Is there an API to get the invoice total with a preview, similar to a billing run preview?","response":"Yes, you can use the `subscription preview` API with the appropriate target dates. It provides invoice totals and tax splits (with and without tax).","category":"Procedural","topic":"Invoice Total Preview"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to remove data for a divested business that is co-mingled in a single tenant?","response":"If Zuora Finance/Accounting periods were not used, you can mass delete the accounts (which soft deletes them). If accounting periods were closed, you cannot delete the data; you must instead \"scrub\" it by updating fields to dummy values and using scrubbing APIs.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Divested Data Removal"}
{"instruction":"Can I reverse a Credit Memo generated from an invoice if the credit amount needs to be corrected later?","response":"If the Credit Memo was generated by a bill run (e.g., proration credit), you should be able to reverse it if the \"Reverse credit memos\" permission is enabled. If it was manually created from an invoice, reversal logic may differ.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Reverse Credit Memo"}
{"instruction":"How can I get notifications for failed Async Order API calls (`v1/async/orders`) since standard notifications don't support them?","response":"There is no automatic notification feature for `v1/async/orders` failures. You must proactively track the status using the `GET_JobStatusAndResponse` API.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Async Order Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to add a feature to a subscription rate plan without overwriting existing features?","response":"No, currently the update logic requires you to read all existing features and resend the complete list (existing + new) in the update call. Sending only the new feature will overwrite the existing ones.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Update Product Features"}
{"instruction":"Can we create user roles via API for OneID?","response":"No, there is currently no official API to create user roles for OneID. While OneID uses SCIM v2, roles are not part of the exposed schema.","category":"Definitional","topic":"OneID User Roles API"}
{"instruction":"Does a CreatedById of `...0003` on a payment method indicate it was created by the PMU (Payment Method Updater)?","response":"Yes, the user ID ending in `...0003` typically belongs to the Payment Method Updater (PMU) or internal scheduler jobs.","category":"Definitional","topic":"PMU User ID"}
{"instruction":"A customer bills in arrears with quantity finalized at month-end and wants no proration. The 'Always Charge Full' setting prevents updates. How should this be handled?","response":"The recommended approach is to model this as a Usage charge. Using a recurring charge would require creating a new amendment/segment every month to update the quantity, which creates data overhead. Usage charges naturally handle variable quantities without versioning the subscription.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Usage vs Recurring Charge"}
{"instruction":"Why is unbilled usage not showing up in the UI even though usage has been uploaded?","response":"This can happen if the feature was recently enabled or if there was a snag in the migration job.

{"instruction":"Why are Revenue Schedules not being created for a Credit Memo when I specify `financeInformation` in the API?","response":"If you include `financeInformation` in the API call but leave `revenueRecognitionRuleName` empty, it may override the inherited rule with a null value. You must either provide a valid `revenueRecognitionRuleName` in the call or remove the `financeInformation` object to allow inheritance.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"CM Revenue Schedule Missing"}
{"instruction":"Why is my Report failing in the USA tenant when the same query works in the MEX tenant?","response":"The `User` table is not supported in the Reporting module (though it works in Data Query). The query in the MEX tenant likely had the `User` table commented out or removed, while the USA version included it. Removing the `User` table from the report query should fix the error.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Reporting Error User Table"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to sync the product catalog between environments if Deployment Manager is failing on certain fields?","response":"An effective alternative is to write a Data Query or Data Source export that maps fields exactly to the Data Loader templates. You can then export the data and use the Data Loader to import it into the target environment.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Product Catalog Sync"}
{"instruction":"What permission is required to use Dynamic Pricing APIs?","response":"You need the `DynamicPricing` (tenant/t9) permission. This is separate from the New Catalog or Context Attributes permissions. Support can enable this if approved by Product.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Dynamic Pricing Permission"}
{"instruction":"What happens if a payment gateway fails during reconciliation/settlement after initially marking the payment as success?","response":"Zuora typically creates an external refund with a reason code like \"Payment Rejection\" or \"Payment Reversal\" (for chargebacks). If the payment was asynchronous and in `Pending` status, the reconciliation will mark it as `Error`.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Payment Gateway Reconciliation Failure"}
{"instruction":"Can new customers enable Word templates for billing documents?","response":"Word templates are in maintenance mode and not enabled by default. While they can technically be enabled via a tenant property, it is strongly recommended to use HTML templates due to lack of new feature support and technical debt associated with Word templates.","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Word Templates"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to automatically pass a Product Rate Plan Charge custom field to the Subscription Rate Plan Charge if they share the same API name?","response":"No, there is no automatic mapping.

{"instruction":"How can I fix a Prepaid Drawdown issue where a top-up mid-month doesn't cover usage from earlier in the month due to the fund start date?","response":"Backdating the effective start date of the charge does not update the fund start date. The recommended solution is to remove the top-up charge and re-add it with a start date that aligns with the beginning of the subscription period or the usage usage period.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"Prepaid Drawdown Top-up"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to bill a monthly minimum charge monthly, but bill the overage only at the end of the quarter?","response":"This is difficult to achieve natively. Potential workarounds include: 1) Splitting the subscription into monthly and quarterly bills (manual), or 2) Using metering to hold usage and only submit the overage usage in the third month of the quarter (loses monthly tracking).","category":"Best_practice","topic":"Quarterly Overage Billing"}

{"instruction":"Is there a storage limit for the Audit Trail for Credit Memos and Invoices?","response":"No, there is no storage limit to worry about; this is an out-of-the-box feature.","category":"Definitional","topic":"Audit Trail"}
{"instruction":"How can I consolidate invoices from previous accounting periods into a single invoice?","response":"Zuora's Invoice Grouping is forward-looking. To consolidate past invoices, you generally need to offset or cancel the original invoices (ideally in an open accounting period) and then re-bill the period with a configuration that naturally groups the charges into a single consolidated invoice.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Invoice Consolidation"}
{"instruction":"How can I retrieve workflow usage data for workflows that are outside the cleanup period?","response":"You can check usage in Cerebro under Trends -> Workflow tasks, or via OneID -> Zuora Entitlements. Usage consumption metrics persist and can be viewed even if the specific workflow instances or tasks have been purged.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Workflow Usage"}
{"instruction":"How can I view or extract Unbilled Usage data?","response":"In the UI, you can see 'View Unbilled Usage' at the charge level on the subscription view. For extraction, Unbilled Usage is stored in the `RatingResult` object, which is accessible via the `queryRatingResults` API or through Data Query (RatingResult table). Note that this provides the usage charge amount.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Unbilled Usage"}
{"instruction":"How do I change a legacy custom field from non-indexed to indexed?","response":"You cannot simply toggle the index status of a legacy custom field. You must perform a migration: create a new indexed custom field, export the data from the old field, import it to the new field, and then swap the API names (or maintain sync via Custom Logic/Workflow until the swap is complete).","category":"Procedural","topic":"Custom Fields"}
{"instruction":"What are the recommended tax engines for EMEA and ANZ regions?","response":"A common trend is to use Zuora Tax (Z-Tax) for EU, UK, and ANZ jurisdictions as the tax tables are simpler to maintain. External tax engines like Avalara or OneSource are typically used for US and Canada. Customers often use conditional logic (e.g., Liquid) to route tax calculations to Avalara for US/CAN and Z-Tax for other regions.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Tax Engines"}
{"instruction":"Is there a specific API endpoint to check if a subscription is in a 'grace period' (unpaid renewal term)?","response":"No, there is no single 'grace period' endpoint as this is a customer-defined state. The recommended approach is to check for invoices with rejected payments related to the subscription. Note that using Data Query for single-subscription checks is not recommended due to concurrency limits; instead, you may need to chain API calls to link Subscriptions to Invoices.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"API Usage"}
{"instruction":"I am getting a 'RenewalSetting is required' error on a v1/orders API call even though the field is present. What could be the cause?","response":"This error can be misleading and may be caused by an invalid or problematic 'Idempotency-Key' parameter in the request header. Removing or fixing the idempotency key often resolves the issue.","category":"Troubleshooting","topic":"API Usage"}
{"instruction":"How can I access my user OAuth credentials in a sandbox if I cannot access the Users menu in the Administration settings?","response":"You can workaround the UI issue by using a direct URL: `https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/UserLogin.do?method=view&id=INSERT_ID_HERE`. You will need to query your User ID via API first to construct the link.","category":"Workaround","topic":"Sandbox Access"}
{"instruction":"When are OANDA FX rates populated in Zuora Billing?","response":"Zuora Billing pulls OANDA rates once a day. OANDA publishes one rate per currency pair per day (ending at 22:00 UTC on the previous day), so the lookback is usually 1 to 2 days in the past.","category":"Definitional","topic":"FX Rates"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended strategy and duration for an Invoice Settlement migration?","response":"For large data volumes, migrations can take a weekend, during which payments and bill runs are typically paused. To minimize downtime, you can perform a background silent payment migration before the main Invoice Settlement migration. Alternatively, migrating via Invoice Settlement Harmony (ISH) can potentially result in zero downtime.","category":"Best Practice","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"How can I mass update Revenue fields like 'Right to Bill Flag' or 'Exclude Item Booking'?","response":"You can use Deployment Manager or the 'Data Backfill' option located under Revenue Settings.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Revenue Settings"}
{"instruction":"How can I mass uncheck the 'Recognize revenue without deferral' checkbox in the Product Catalog?","response":"There is no specific boolean flag for this in the object model; it is a UI interpretation. To 'uncheck' it, you must update the `DeferredRevenueAccount` field to be different from the `RecognizedRevenueAccount` field (using the accounting code name). This can be done via Data Loader.","category":"Procedural","topic":"Product Catalog"}
{"instruction":"Can I filter an Advanced Bill Run using dynamic dates like 'same as run date'?","response":"Current UI advanced filters do not support dynamic dates like 'same as run date'. However, new variables such as `{{BillRunDate}}`, `{{TargetDate}}`, and `{{InvoiceDate}}` are being introduced to support this via API, with deployment to staging starting early December 2025.","category":"Roadmap","topic":"Bill Run Filters"}
{"instruction":"How can I check if a specific workflow definition or version is currently running from within another workflow?","response":"You can use the Liquid filter `active_run_check_by_version` passing the version ID (e.g., `{{ '' | active_run_check_by_version: workflow_version_id }}`) or `active_run_check_by_definition` passing the definition ID. Alternatively, `active_run_check` returns true if any runs are in Pending, Queued, or Processing status. Note that on older tenants/workflows, if the \"Ignore Pending Status\" setting is active, the status might show as Finished even if tasks like Approval or Delay are pending.","category":"procedural","topic":"check active runs"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to add an XML document (like for Factur-x/ZUGFeRD) to an invoice PDF using Workflow?","response":"Yes, you can use the File Operations task, which was initially developed for requirements like French Factur-X, to attach XML files to PDF invoices.","category":"procedural","topic":"invoice attachments"}
{"instruction":"How can I implement bulkified error handling in a workflow to send a single success/failure email report instead of one per error?","response":"You can use a Data Query task querying the `workflow_tasks` table on the finish flow path. This allows you to retrieve the status and results of the executed tasks, which you can then compile into a CSV report to attach to a single email notification.","category":"best_practice","topic":"error handling"}
{"instruction":"How do I evaluate a boolean input variable in a Liquid If task?","response":"Liquid supports boolean types, so you can compare directly (e.g., `{% if Data.Workflow.AllowAnyMonth %}`). Ensure your comparison expression evaluates to an explicit `True` or `False`. If the input is a string \"true\"/\"false\", standard string comparison applies.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"liquid boolean logic"}
{"instruction":"How do I filter Order Actions by Invoice ID or Subscription ID since those fields aren't on the OrderAction object?","response":"You should use the Query task (which supports joins) rather than the Object Query task. Follow the Zuora Object Model path: Invoice -> InvoiceItem -> Subscription -> RatePlan -> OrderActionRatePlan -> OrderAction. Note that the Query task has limited filtering options in the UI compared to Data Query; you may need to retrieve a broader set and filter within Liquid if specific field filters are missing.","category":"procedural","topic":"querying order actions"}
{"instruction":"Where can I find logs for SFTP task errors if the task fails?","response":"If the SFTP task fails to establish a connection (due to credentials, whitelisting, or connectivity issues), Workflow logs often will not show detailed SFTP server logs. You must verify credentials and network connectivity (allowlisting Zuora IPs) externally.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"SFTP logs"}
{"instruction":"Can I use the MERGE task in a production environment?","response":"No, the Merge task is currently not granted for use in non-sandbox environments. You should use serial execution logic or the \"File Operations: CSV Creation\" task to combine data outputs.","category":"definitional","topic":"merge task"}
{"instruction":"Why do Javascript tasks sometimes get stuck in \"processing\" state indefinitely on new tenants?","response":"This can occur if the specific feature flag enabling Javascript tasks has not been turned on for the new tenant. You would need to contact Zuora support/engineering to enable it.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"javascript task"}
{"instruction":"How can I remove carriage return (\\r) characters from a string using Liquid?","response":"The standard `replace` filter may not catch special characters depending on encoding. The `strip_newlines` filter removes `\\r\\n`. For specific control, you can use regex filters.","category":"procedural","topic":"liquid string manipulation"}
{"instruction":"Can I configure Workflow to send failure notifications per workflow execution rather than per task failure?","response":"The standard workflow notification is a summary per execution. However, for high-volume real-time workflows, this can still be spammy. It is best practice to disable standard notifications for such workflows and build a custom monitoring workflow (using Data Query on `workflow_run` or `workflow_task`) to generate periodic error reports.","category":"best_practice","topic":"notifications"}
{"instruction":"Does the Liquid `date` filter return UTC or local time when using \"now\"?","response":"It typically returns UTC. To ensure the timezone is explicit, you can format the date string to include timezone information, for example: `{{ \"now\" | date: \"%FT%T%z - %Z\" }}`.","category":"definitional","topic":"liquid date time"}
{"instruction":"How can I merge two Data Query output files in Workflow?","response":"If the total row count is under 500k, you can use a single Data Query with a `UNION` operator. For larger datasets or separate files, use the \"File: FileOperations > CSV Creation\" task to merge them.","category":"procedural","topic":"merging files"}
{"instruction":"Is there a setting to automatically deactivate a workflow after a specific duration?","response":"No, there is currently no native setting to auto-deactivate a workflow after a set number of days.","category":"definitional","topic":"workflow settings"}
{"instruction":"Why does a 300KB XML payload result in a \"Data exceeds size limit of 5 MB\" error when converting to JSON?","response":"This inflation often happens if the XML structure contains significant repeated data or very long keys, which expand significantly when converted to the JSON object structure in the payload.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"payload size limit"}
{"instruction":"Is there a fix for overlapping arrows in the UI when multiple branches exit a single task?","response":"This is a known UI limitation. A workaround is to add a dummy/passthrough task on one of the branches to visually separate the paths, though this consumes an additional task execution.","category":"best_practice","topic":"UI layout"}
{"instruction":"Is there a performance difference between Liquid and JavaScript tasks?","response":"Yes, Liquid tasks are generally faster and lighter resource-wise. JavaScript tasks require spinning up a sandbox environment, which can add latency. Use Liquid for logic manipulation whenever possible.","category":"best_practice","topic":"performance"}
{"instruction":"How can I identify workflows that are using deprecated APIs?","response":"You can use Data Query on the `workflow_api_call` table (for execution history) or parse the `workflow_task` table (for definitions). Additionally, the \"System Health\" dashboard in Zuora often highlights usage of deprecated APIs.","category":"procedural","topic":"deprecated APIs"}
{"instruction":"Does Workflow reuse OAuth tokens for callouts?","response":"Yes, Workflow caches OAuth tokens until they expire. If you change the scope or requirements for the token mid-process or between runs, the cached token might be invalid. You may need to manually force a refresh or wait for expiration if scopes change.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"authentication"}
{"instruction":"Can I store a string larger than 8KB in a Custom Object field via Workflow?","response":"No, Custom Object text fields typically have a limit (e.g., 8192 characters). You cannot compress the string within Liquid to fit this limit reliably. You must split the data into multiple fields or records.","category":"limitation","topic":"custom objects"}
{"instruction":"How can I convert a local time string to UTC in Liquid?","response":"Use the `timezone` filter. For example: `{{ \"2024-09-12T15:35:00-0700\" | date: format | timezone: format, format, 'Etc/UTC' }}`. This is more reliable than `in_time_zone` which may not support all identifiers.","category":"procedural","topic":"liquid timezones"}
{"instruction":"How can I filter an array of objects in Liquid?","response":"Use the `where` or `where_exp` filter. For example: `{% assign filtered = Data.Array | where_exp: 'item', 'item.field == value' %}`. Note that complex AND/OR logic isn't directly supported inside `where_exp`; chain multiple filters or use `concat` for OR logic.","category":"procedural","topic":"liquid arrays"}
{"instruction":"What is the hard payload limit for AWS Lambda tasks in Workflow?","response":"The limit is 6MB (precisely 6,291,456 bytes), which is enforced by AWS. If your payload exceeds this, you must send a reference (file URL/ID) rather than the full data payload.","category":"limitation","topic":"lambda task"}
{"instruction":"How should I configure max concurrency for a workflow?","response":"It is recommended to set the max concurrency limit on a single task (typically the bottleneck or primary callout) rather than on every task. Setting it on multiple tasks can lead to conflicting throttling behaviors.","category":"best_practice","topic":"concurrency"}
{"instruction":"Can I execute a workflow in synchronous/responsive mode to get an immediate API response?","response":"No, synchronous mode is generally not available for new customers. You should use asynchronous patterns (fire-and-forget) and poll for results or have the workflow call back to your system.","category":"limitation","topic":"synchronous mode"}
{"instruction":"How can I get a report of task counts per workflow definition?","response":"Standard UI reporting is often tenant-wide. You can run a Data Query on the `workflow_task` and `workflow` tables, joining them to aggregate task counts by workflow definition ID over a specific date range.","category":"procedural","topic":"reporting"}
{"instruction":"Why does the Liquid date filter sometimes parse dates incorrectly (e.g., swapping day and month)?","response":"Liquid's date parsing (Ruby based) usually defaults to US format (MM/DD/YYYY). If your input is DD/MM/YYYY (e.g., \"04/01/2024\"), it may be misinterpreted. You should string-manipulate the input into ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) before passing it to the date filter.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"liquid date parsing"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to verify the HTML formatting of an email task without running it?","response":"Yes, you can use the \"Preview\" button within the Email task configuration to render the HTML and verify the layout.","category":"procedural","topic":"email task"}
{"instruction":"How do I schedule a workflow to run relative to the end of the month (e.g., 2 days before EOM)?","response":"The native scheduler is interval-based. To achieve this, schedule the workflow to run daily and add a conditional \"If\" task at the start that checks if the current date matches your target logic (e.g., `current_date == eom - 2 days`) using Liquid.","category":"procedural","topic":"scheduling"}
{"instruction":"How do I attach an invoice PDF to a Workflow email?","response":"You need the File ID of the invoice PDF.

{"instruction":"How can I delete a nested object from the workflow data payload?","response":"The \"Paths of data payload values to delete\" setting only supports top-level keys (e.g., `Data.LinkData`). It cannot reliably delete deeply nested keys (e.g., `Data.LinkData.data`). You may need to delete the parent object or overwrite the variable in Liquid (though this doesn't fully reclaim payload size for downstream limits).","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"payload management"}
{"instruction":"Why does a Workflow show as Active in the list but Inactive when opened?","response":"The list view shows the Workflow *Definition* status, while the detail view shows the status of the specific *Version* you are viewing. A definition can be active (billable) while a specific version draft is inactive.","category":"definitional","topic":"workflow status"}
{"instruction":"How does the \"Automatically retry on timeout related errors\" work for callouts?","response":"It retries any response code that is NOT listed in the \"Successful Status Code\" configuration. It does not intelligently distinguish between retryable (e.g., 500) and non-retryable (e.g., 404) errors unless you explicitly configure non-retryable errors as \"success\" and handle them in logic.","category":"best_practice","topic":"callout retry"}
{"instruction":"How can I avoid the 5MB payload size limit error?","response":"Delete unneeded data paths from the payload as early as possible using the task configuration.

{"instruction":"How can I track data (e.g., counters) across iterations in a Workflow Iterate task?","response":"Workflow Iterate tasks spawn independent threads, so local variable mutations do not persist outside the iteration. To track counts or data: 1) For errors, use `Data.Iterate.Tasks.Error`. 2) For business data, write to a custom field on a persistent object (e.g., Payment) during the iteration, then query that object using Data Query (DQ) in an 'On Complete' task. Note: Engineering advises against querying internal Workflow tables for financial reporting; use standard or custom objects instead.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Iterate Task"}
{"instruction":"What IP addresses need to be allowlisted for incoming emails from Zuora's AWS SES services?","response":"You should allowlist the IP ranges used by Amazon SES.

Best practice is to use the `SubscriptionNumber` instead of `SubscriptionId` when linking objects (like Usage) to a Subscription in API calls or Workflow tasks.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Creation"}
{"instruction":"How can I use Liquid dynamically in the \"Approval Emails\" field if the UI validation fails?","response":"If the UI rejects a standalone Liquid tag (e.g., `{{Data.Email}}`), a known workaround is to include a dummy email address alongside the tag (e.g., `dummy@example.com, {{Data.Email}}`). This satisfies the validation requirement while still processing the dynamic tag.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Approval Task"}
{"instruction":"How can I configure a Workflow to run at multiple specific times per day (e.g., 10:05 and 12:05)?","response":"In the schedule settings, you can use Cron syntax in the interval field. To specify multiple hours, use a comma-separated list. For example, `0 5 10,12 /1 * *` will run the workflow at 10:05 and 12:05. Note that the minute value (5) applies to both hours.","category":"procedural","topic":"Scheduling"}
{"instruction":"What are the requirements for setting up a Slack Bot for Workflow notifications or approvals?","response":"You must create a Slack App/Bot with a manifest including scopes like `chat:write`, `users:read`, and `users:read.email`. Install the app in your workspace, then use the generated Bot User OAuth Token in your Workflow configuration.","category":"procedural","topic":"Slack Integration"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended design for a Workflow that needs to poll an external system for many days (e.g., 25 days)?","response":"Do not keep a single Workflow instance active for extended periods (e.g., 25 days). Instead, split the process: use one Workflow to initiate the job, and a separate scheduled Workflow (e.g., running daily) to check the status until completion.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Long-Running Processes"}
{"instruction":"Does the SFTP Upload task impact Zuora API concurrency limits?","response":"It depends on the file source. If you are uploading a file generated within Workflow (internal Workflow file), it does not consume Zuora API concurrency. If you are uploading a Zuora file by ID (fetching it from Zuora first), it may trigger an API call to download the file, thus counting towards concurrency.","category":"definitional","topic":"Concurrency Limits"}
{"instruction":"What is the best method to generate a report from a Billing Preview Run in Workflow?","response":"Instead of parsing the legacy CSV/JSON output of the Billing Preview via file transformation tasks, use Data Query to select directly from the `BillingPreviewRunResult` table. This table contains the preview data and allows for SQL-based filtering and joining (e.g., with Product Rate Plan Charges) within the Workflow.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing Preview"}
{"instruction":"What are the iteration limits for manual loops in Workflow?","response":"For manual loops (created by connecting tasks in a cycle), the limit is 100 iterations in Sandbox environments and 1,000 iterations in Production environments.","category":"definitional","topic":"Limits"}
{"instruction":"How do I fix the \"At least 1 email address is required\" error when I have already typed an email in Workflow settings?","response":"The Workflow UI uses \"chips\" for email addresses. After typing the email address, you must press **Enter** or **Return** to convert the text into a chip. Simply clicking save without pressing Enter will result in the validation error.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"UI Configuration"}
{"instruction":"Why do multipart/form-data Callout tasks fail with AWS S3 or Google Drive APIs?","response":"These APIs often require specific field ordering (e.g., the 'key' or metadata must appear before the 'file' content). Currently, the Workflow Callout task may send the file content first, causing the API to reject the request. A fix (WF-9956) is in progress; there is no simple workaround using the standard Callout task without code changes.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Callout Task"}
{"instruction":"How do I handle expired `Credentials.zuora.session` tokens in long-running Workflows?","response":"The standard session token expires after 1 hour. If your workflow runs longer, use the `new_session` key (instead of `session`) in your authentication step or subsequent calls to generate a fresh session token on demand.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Authentication"}
{"instruction":"How can I access a data key in Liquid that contains a trailing dot (e.g., from an SFTP task)?","response":"Standard dot notation (e.g., `Data.File.`) will fail if the key name has special characters. Use bracket notation and quotes instead: `Data.Files['SFTP_Key_With_Dot.']['name']`.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Liquid Syntax"}
{"instruction":"How should the Private Key be formatted for the Javascript task's JWT signing function?","response":"The private key string must explicitly include the headers `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`. Missing these headers can cause an \"init failed not supported argument\" error.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Javascript Task"}
{"instruction":"Can I generate a file from a Workflow variable?","response":"Yes, using JSON/File operations. However, be aware of the 5MB payload limit for variables passed between tasks. Avoid storing large file contents in variables; instead, generate the file immediately or manipulate file handles/streams where possible.","category":"best_practice","topic":"File Generation"}
{"instruction":"What should be checked if Workflows are stuck in 'Queued' status in a Staging environment?","response":"This often indicates that the worker pool is saturated (e.g., by high-volume QA testing). The resolution typically involves assigning dedicated workers or enabling autoscaling for the specific tenant.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Infrastructure"}
{"instruction":"What is the correct endpoint for querying Workflow metrics/diagnostics?","response":"The correct endpoint for graph/metrics queries is `https://metrics.tools.admin.uw2.aws.zuora/graph`. Older URLs (e.g., `vmselect`) may be deprecated or return 404s.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Diagnostics"}
{"instruction":"What is the record limit for CSV uploads using the Direct File Input method?","response":"While not strictly capped by a hard low number, testing confirms that file sizes up to 150,000 rows can be processed successfully, provided the per-row data volume is not excessive.","category":"definitional","topic":"Limits"}
{"instruction":"Why would a workflow hit a rate limit (e.g., 3102 requests) when the task only executed 400 times?","response":"Rate limits in Workflow apply to the total number of API requests made, not just the number of tasks executed. A single task execution can generate multiple API requests (e.g., internal polling, retries). You can verify the specific request count by checking the 'API calls' tab within the task's Swimlane details.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"rate_limits"}
{"instruction":"Why do I get a 'Liquid error: Data Error: Undefined variable' in a Callout task when the same Liquid works in the Liquid Tester?","response":"The Liquid Tester often has the 'Use Strict Variables' checkbox unchecked by default, allowing undefined variables to pass. The task environment might have this checked. Try unchecking 'Use Strict Variables' in the task settings to resolve the discrepancy.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"liquid_logic"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'ExecutionDateTime' and 'ExecutionDateTimeUTC' behavior?","response":"'ExecutionDateTime' may reflect local time based on tenant settings when a workflow is started manually, but might switch to UTC when triggered by events. For consistent behavior across all trigger types, it is recommended to use 'ExecutionDateTimeUTC'.","category":"best_practice","topic":"date_time_logic"}
{"instruction":"How can I query records created more than 6 months prior to the 'Workflow.ExecutionDate' using Data Query?","response":"You can use the 'DATE' literal syntax in your query combined with Liquid to calculate the target date. For example: `SELECT * FROM table WHERE date(createddate__c) <= DATE '{{calculated_date}}'`. Ensure you calculate the date string (e.g., '2025-12-22') in a preceding Liquid step or variable.","category":"procedural","topic":"data_query"}
{"instruction":"How do I access a CSV column with a space in the header (e.g., 'DI Client Id') using Liquid?","response":"You can access keys with spaces using square bracket notation and quotes: `{{row[\"DI Client Id\"]}}`.","category":"procedural","topic":"liquid_logic"}
{"instruction":"What are the volume limitations for JSON input to a workflow via the API?","response":"There is a payload size limit of 5MB for the request body. Additionally, the HTTP request must complete within a 120-second timeout window.","category":"definitional","topic":"api_limits"}
{"instruction":"Does the Workflow Callout task support the OAuth 2.0 'Authorization Code' grant type?","response":"No, the Workflow Callout task does not currently support the Authorization Code grant type.","category":"definitional","topic":"#workflow"}
{"instruction":"Why does an 'Execute WF Task' fail with 'ID not found' even though the task ID seems correct?","response":"This error can occur if the task is configured to poll for the completion of a target workflow, and that specific target workflow instance has been deleted or cleaned up.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"#workflow"}
{"instruction":"How do I display HTML in a Responsive UI Action using the Response Formatter task?","response":"You can pass a string containing the HTML within the JSON response. Ensure the HTML string is properly escaped or quoted within the JSON structure (e.g., `\"<html>...</html>\"`).","category":"procedural","topic":"ui_actions"}
{"instruction":"Can I generate a hash for a large CSV export within Workflow to verify file integrity?","response":"You can compute a hash (e.g., MD5) via Liquid or JavaScript for small files that fit in the payload. However, for large files (e.g., large Data Query exports), loading the file into memory to compute the hash is not feasible due to size limits.","category":"definitional","topic":"file_handling"}
{"instruction":"Why don't the 'Updated By' and 'Updated At' fields change when I deactivate a workflow?","response":"Activating or deactivating a workflow updates the workflow definition level, not the specific version. These changes might not be visible on the version history UI but can be tracked via Data Query on the workflow table or logs.","category":"definitional","topic":"#workflow"}
{"instruction":"Does using a Delay task to wait for an hour hold system resources or risk being flagged?","response":"No, the Delay task simply pauses the workflow run for the specified duration. Subsequent tasks execute after the delay. It does not actively hold resources in a way that would cause resource exhaustion issues.","category":"definitional","topic":"performance"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to configure the Iterate task to run sequentially instead of in parallel?","response":"The Iterate task is designed for parallel execution ('divide and conquer'). To achieve sequential processing, you must configure Swimlanes and decision tasks (If/Case) to flow linearly, or use a 'Single Threaded Loop' pattern (e.g., a task calling itself).","category":"best_practice","topic":"iteration_logic"}
{"instruction":"How can I report on Workflow task usage history beyond the 45-day retention period?","response":"Workflow data is cleaned up every 45 days. To maintain historical reporting (e.g., 12-month trends), you should regularly export Data Query results (e.g., every 40 days) to external storage for offline analysis.","category":"best_practice","topic":"reporting"}
{"instruction":"Why does the Iterate task with 'Unique Field' only process the first row for each key?","response":"This is the intended behavior of the 'Unique Field' iteration type; it picks the first row for each unique key. If you need to process all data associated with that key, you should aggregate the data into a single row within your Data Query (e.g., using `ARRAY_AGG` or `MAP_AGG`) before iterating.","category":"best_practice","topic":"iteration_logic"}
{"instruction":"How can I remove the xml version declaration from the output of an XML Transform task?","response":"In your XSLT configuration, use the output method `text` instead of `xml`. For example: `<xsl:output method=\"text\" indent=\"yes\" ... />`. This prevents the XML declaration (`<?xml ... ?>`) from being automatically generated.","category":"procedural","topic":"xml_transform"}
{"instruction":"What is the actual concurrency limit for Data Query tasks in Workflow?","response":"Workflow allows 5 Data Query tasks to process concurrently per tenant. While the Data Query service might queue more requests (e.g., up to 15), Workflow itself throttles active processing to 5.","category":"definitional","topic":"concurrency"}
{"instruction":"Can I transform a large XML file using the XML Transform task without hitting the 5MB payload limit?","response":"Yes, as long as you do not write the transformed data into the workflow payload (the `data` object). If the transformation reads from a file and writes to a file, it can handle larger sizes.","category":"best_practice","topic":"file_handling"}
{"instruction":"Can I upload a file as input when triggering a workflow via the Run Workflow API?","response":"No, file inputs are not supported via the Run Workflow API due to volume handling limitations. The API supports JSON object payloads (`application/json`).","category":"definitional","topic":"api_limits"}
{"instruction":"Where can I see the file uploaded to a workflow or generated during a run?","response":"You can find files associated with a workflow run in the 'Files' tab of the run detail view, or in the 'Run History' section.","category":"procedural","topic":"troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"Does Workflow have the ability to read files directly from S3?","response":"Yes, you can read files from S3 using the standard Callout task if the S3 bucket provides a public API or accessible URL.","category":"procedural","topic":"integrations"}
{"instruction":"How can I schedule the same workflow to run at different times for different Organizations (Orgs) in a multi-org tenant?","response":"You can create multiple schedules for the workflow (one for each required time). Then, within the workflow, use an If/Case task to check the current Organization ID and execute the appropriate logic for that Org.","category":"best_practice","topic":"scheduling"}
{"instruction":"Why does my Callout task fail with '400 Unable to process JSON' when constructing a JSON payload manually?","response":"Ensure that all keys in your JSON structure are wrapped in double quotes (e.g., `\"key\": \"value\"`). Missing quotes around keys is a common cause of invalid JSON errors in manual payload construction.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"json_construction"}
{"instruction":"Why is my Case task not matching a value that appears correct in the Liquid Tester?","response":"Check for trailing or leading whitespace in the value configuration of the Case task. Extra spaces can cause the match to fail even if the visible characters look identical.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"liquid_logic"}
{"instruction":"Is the concurrency limit applied per workflow run or per workflow definition?","response":"Concurrency limits are capped per workflow *definition*. For example, if a task has a concurrency limit of 5, and there are 20 concurrent runs of that workflow, only 5 instances of that task will run simultaneously across all runs.","category":"definitional","topic":"concurrency"}
{"instruction":"Can we customize the sender number for the SMS task?","response":"The native SMS task does not support customizing the sender number. The recommended best practice is to use a standard Callout task to integrate with a provider like Twilio directly, where you can control the sender ID.","category":"best_practice","topic":"sms_task"}
{"instruction":"What does the error 'Absolute max of 5 retries achieved' mean?","response":"Workflow has an internal system-level retry mechanism (usually 5 attempts) for handling transient failures, which is separate from the user-configured 'Max Retry Count' in the task settings. This error indicates the system retries have been exhausted.","category":"definitional","topic":"error_handling"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to create a .txt file from a JSON output in a workflow task, and how can the file be renamed?","response":"Yes, it is possible. To create a file, you can use the \"Generate custom doc\" approach where you ensure the output in the file is your desired content (e.g., JSON), and then rename the resulting file. By default, the file might be created with an extension like .html or .json, but you can rename it to .txt using the file download and renaming capabilities available in tasks like the email task or by following specific file manipulation steps outlined in internal documentation (e.g., method 3 in the referenced \"Producing a .json file from Workflow\" page).","category":"procedural","topic":"File Conversion"}
{"instruction":"Why is the autocomplete feature in the liquid tester disabled or not working?","response":"The autocomplete feature in the liquid tester has been disabled due to a known issue or licensing problem (specifically mentioned as a licensing issue in some contexts). It is expected to be disabled in the next release, with a new autocomplete solution planned for release shortly thereafter.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Liquid Tester"}
{"instruction":"Why does a workflow scheduled to run on a specific schedule only execute on demand?","response":"A workflow version must be active for it to run via a schedule. If the specific version is inactive, the schedule will not trigger the execution.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Workflow Scheduling"}
{"instruction":"Is there a way to query an S3 bucket to filter data and create a CSV file with detailed processed events post-bill run using Workflow?","response":"Currently, there is no direct out-of-the-box Workflow task to query S3 buckets and filter data in that manner. Users often look for alternatives or ask if this is on the roadmap, but no immediate confirmation of this specific feature exists in the current context.","category":"comparison","topic":"S3 Integration"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to merge multiple invoice PDF files into a single PDF document using Workflow?","response":"There is no native capability in Workflow to merge multiple PDF files. Doing so would require complex byte manipulation which is not supported. The recommended approach is to use a 3rd party engine invoked by the Workflow to perform the merge, though this involves sending customer data to an external processor which raises privacy and GDPR considerations.","category":"best_practice","topic":"PDF Merging"}
{"instruction":"How can I access input parameters defined in Workflow settings when triggering the workflow via API?","response":"When defining input parameters in Workflow settings for API triggering, you must populate the \"Input Field Name\" option for the parameter to be correctly mapped and accessible from the API payload.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"API Input Parameters"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to view workflow logs or history older than 30 days?","response":"By default, the UI may only show recent history (e.g., <30 days). To view older logs, you can query the `workflow_task` object via Data Query and filter using `createddate`. Additionally, the cleanup policy can potentially be increased (e.g., to 45 days) to retain logs longer.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow Logs"}
{"instruction":"Can I use an HTML invoice template from \"Manage Billing Document Configuration\" in a \"Create Invoice\" workflow task?","response":"No. The templates in \"Manage Billing Document Configuration\" use core billing technologies (Word/Aspose or HTML/Unlayer) which are distinct from the workflow task that typically uses a Puppeteer/Node library approach. You cannot directly reuse a core billing template in that specific workflow task.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction":"Why am I unable to retrieve subscription-level fields in a Callout Template workflow mapping when triggering based on a callout configuration?","response":"Historically, custom events could not send an array of child objects (like subscriptions) in the data payload. However, this feature was added in the 2025.Q3 release. You can now select linked objects like Subscriptions and Products for templates linked to Order events.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Callout Templates"}
{"instruction":"Can I configure custom logic to trigger only on Invoice Create (not Update) without triggering the workflow on every update?","response":"There was a configuration option to select \"Create\" vs \"Update\" triggers, but users have reported it missing from the UI, suggesting it might be a bug or regression. Without this option visible, avoiding triggers on updates is difficult.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Trigger Logic"}
{"instruction":"How do I get the file output from an \"Export a report run\" API call in Workflow?","response":"The response from the export report run API typically contains a file ID. You should use that file ID in a subsequent \"File Download\" task to retrieve the actual file. If the file ID is missing from the response, verify the API version and response format.","category":"procedural","topic":"Report Export"}
{"instruction":"How can I convert a Liquid array into a CSV file using the JSON task and CSV processor?","response":"To convert a Liquid array to CSV, the array must consist of flat JSON objects. If any item in the array contains nested objects or arrays, the conversion will fail with an \"invalid array\" error.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Conversion"}
{"instruction":"How can I get the details of a specific custom object record if I only have a `TemplateID` (not the system ID) and cannot use Data Query?","response":"You can use the `Query Record` task or the `GET /object-query` API (specifically `GET /settings/custom-objects/objects/{object}/records`) to find records by filtering on specific fields like `TemplateID`, provided that field is indexed.","category":"procedural","topic":"Custom Object Query"}
{"instruction":"How do I perform a callout to another Zuora tenant to get a bearer token if `x-www-form-urlencoded` is greyed out?","response":"You do not need to perform a separate task to get a token. Instead, use the \"Authentication\" tab in the callout task to enter the OAuth credentials for the target tenant. If the target is a multi-entity tenant, ensure you pass the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` header to specify the correct entity.","category":"procedural","topic":"Cross-Tenant Callouts"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to increase the max concurrency for workflow tasks to avoid task exhaustion errors?","response":"Concurrency limits are generally fixed unless a \"Performance Booster\" pack is purchased, which provides double concurrency limits and a dedicated workflow worker. Temporary increases are typically not granted; the recommended path is optimizing workflows or purchasing the performance add-on.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Concurrency Limits"}
{"instruction":"Can I rename a file inside a ZIP archive generated by a Data Query before uploading it via SFTP?","response":"There is no direct setting to rename a file inside a ZIP generated by Data Query. A workaround involves getting the raw file, renaming it within the Workflow (e.g., via file manipulation tasks), zipping the renamed file, and then uploading the new ZIP.","category":"procedural","topic":"File Manipulation"}
{"instruction":"How can I process a row-separated text file (no headers) into an array where each row is an element?","response":"If the data fits within the 5MB payload limit, you can use the `read_file` filter to ingest the text file. This allows you to treat the content as a string which can then be split by newline characters to form an array.","category":"procedural","topic":"File Parsing"}
{"instruction":"How do I handle file names with special characters (like dots) in the payload that break Liquid parsing?","response":"Special characters in keys can break standard dot-notation in Liquid. You may need to reference the data using bracket notation (e.g., `Data['file.name']`) or follow specific workarounds for accessing data with special characters documented in previous threads.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Liquid Syntax"}
{"instruction":"Why does the GraphQL Query task fail or not return expected results for Bill Runs with multiple invoices?","response":"The GraphQL Query task might not be suitable for complex filtering on child objects like Invoices within a Bill Run context. A recommended alternative is to use the `object-query/invoices` API with filters, or for larger datasets, use Data Query or Export which handle bulk data better than synchronous queries.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"GraphQL Query"}
{"instruction":"How do concurrent synchronous tasks (Callout, Query, Object Query) behave in an iteration?","response":"These tasks are synchronous, so the workflow will wait for the response of each before proceeding. Note that if an iteration takes more than 3 hours, it will time out. Additionally, you cannot access the results of individual iterations in the `On-Complete` block because they execute in separate contexts.","category":"definitional","topic":"Task Execution"}
{"instruction":"Can I convert UTF-8 data from a Data Query to UTF-16 within a Workflow?","response":"Workflow tasks typically output UTF-8. There is no standard, simple task configuration to convert character encodings like UTF-8 to UTF-16 directly within the workflow logic.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Character Encoding"}
{"instruction":"What is the maximum number of iterations allowed for a loop in Workflow?","response":"The maximum number of repeat times (iterations) for a loop is 100 in the Sandbox environment and 1000 in the Production environment.","category":"definitional","topic":"Workflow Limits"}
{"instruction":"How can I solve a race condition when updating a shared account-level field during a parallel `For Each` loop?","response":"To avoid race conditions in parallel iterations, use a sequential loop instead of the standard parallel `Iterate` task. A sequential loop can be manually built by connecting a task back to an earlier step with a condition to exit, ensuring one item is processed at a time.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Loop Concurrency"}
{"instruction":"Can I run a Data Query inside an Iterate task loop?","response":"Running a Data Query inside an Iterate task is strongly discouraged (and often effectively forbidden) because it can trigger a massive number of extraction jobs (O(n)), overwhelming the system limits. It is better to perform a single bulk query upfront and then filter or map the results in memory using Liquid or subsequent steps.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Query usage"}
{"instruction":"Why is a target workflow not appearing in the \"Execute Task\" dropdown?","response":"The target workflow must be a near real-time or synchronous workflow (callout enabled), must be active, and must have a specific active version. Additionally, a real-time workflow cannot execute a batch workflow.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Execute Task"}
{"instruction":"How do I update a Global Constant if the edit option is missing?","response":"If you cannot see an edit button, you may be able to overwrite the value by typing in the field and tabbing out. Note that for security reasons, values are often masked, and recent updates have made them write-only or hidden.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Global Constants"}
{"instruction":"Why is my workflow triggered by a custom \"Bill Run Posted\" event running twice?","response":"The \"Bill Run Posted\" event might trigger multiple times if the Bill Run object is updated multiple times while in the 'Posted' state. To prevent this, configure the event filter to check the old field value (e.g., `Status != Posted` AND `Status = Posted`) to ensure it only triggers on the state transition.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Event Triggers"}
{"instruction":"Can Workflow directly trigger a standard Zuora email notification?","response":"Workflow cannot directly \"call\" a notification. Notifications are triggered by events. To send a standard notification, you must trigger the underlying event, for example, by updating a custom field that is configured to fire a custom event/notification.","category":"procedural","topic":"Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Is it expected that `Data.Workflow.ExecutionDateTime` is missing when triggered by 'On Billing Event'?","response":"Yes, some system values like timestamps might be missing or different in the payload for event-triggered workflows compared to scheduled ones, due to how the Kafka message payload is constructed for notifications.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Payload"}
{"instruction":"How do I filter records based on date (e.g., current month) in an Object Query?","response":"Object Query (ZOQL) has limited date functions. You typically calculate the required date range (e.g., `FirstOfMonth` and `FirstOfNextMonth`) using Liquid filters (`date`, `date_manip`) in a previous step, and then inject those values into the WHERE clause of your query.","category":"procedural","topic":"Date Filtering"}
{"instruction":"How can I convert a string to a float while retaining decimal precision (e.g., \"18.39\" to 18.39)?","response":"Standard Liquid filters like `plus: 0.0` might sometimes result in truncation or unexpected formatting if there are hidden characters (like whitespace). Ensure the string is trimmed (`strip`) before applying math filters. If issues persist, verifying the raw string for whitespace is a critical first step.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Liquid Math"}
{"instruction":"How can I send a file to the Data Loader API via Workflow given the multipart/form-data limitations?","response":"Workflow has limitations with ordering multipart fields which Data Loader requires (e.g., the 'key' field must come before the file). A known workaround is to pass the file content as a text field named \"file\" as the last parameter, rather than attaching the file as a binary, though this is not the standard intended usage.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Loader Integration"}
{"instruction":"Can I use the `id` field as an input variable for a Workflow triggered via API?","response":"No, `id` is a system field name and tends to get dropped or cause conflicts in the integration layer. You should use a different variable name (e.g., `zuoraId`, `recordId`) instead of reserved system names like `id`.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Naming Conventions"}
{"instruction":"How can I build an array in Liquid to iterate over later?","response":"You can build a JSON string representing an array (using `capture`) and then parse it using the `parse_json` filter. Alternatively, you can initialize an empty array by splitting an empty string and then using specific filters to push elements, though the JSON parsing method is often more robust for complex objects.","category":"procedural","topic":"Liquid Arrays"}
{"instruction":"Why am I receiving an Entity ID error when specifying {{Credentials.zuora.entities.id}} in a workflow, and how can I fix it?","response":"The error likely occurs because {{Credentials.zuora.entities.id}} returns a 36-hex-digit UUID, while the API may require a 32-hex-digit UUID or a different format. A recommended fix is to use {{Credentials.zuora.entity_id}} instead. However, the safest best practice is to configure a Client ID/Secret globally that has access to a single entity, which avoids this error entirely.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Entity ID"}
{"instruction":"Can we configure custom headers for Workflow Email Notification tasks (e.g., for Amazon SES integration)?","response":"Yes, support for custom headers in Workflow Email Notification tasks was released in version 2025.Q4.1.0. To use this, you must update each email callout task configuration individually. This allows passing headers like configuration sets required by external SMTP servers.","category":"procedural","topic":"Email Headers"}
{"instruction":"How do I authenticate an API callout from Zuora Billing to Zuora Revenue within a workflow?","response":"Authentication from Billing to Revenue is a two-step process, as standard workflow-based auth options apply to Billing only. First, send a callout to the Revenue API endpoint `/api/integration/v1/authenticate` with the relevant credentials to retrieve a token. Second, use the returned token in a header named 'token' for subsequent file uploads or API calls to Revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"Billing to Revenue"}
{"instruction":"How does the Iterate task behave when 'Unique-Field' is selected and multiple records share the same unique field value?","response":"When the Iterate task is configured with the 'Unique-Field' iteration type, if the Data Query returns multiple records with the same unique identifier, the task picks up the first record found.","category":"definitional","topic":"Iterate Task"}
{"instruction":"Why is only one file being sent in my Workflow callout even though I configured two files with the same parameter name (e.g., documentFiles)?","response":"This is a known regression/issue. If you configure a Workflow callout to send multiple files using the same key/parameter name, only one file is successfully sent. This behavior differs from tools like Postman where multiple files under the same key work correctly.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"File Upload"}
{"instruction":"How should I handle Liquid errors stating 'results should be Array instead of Hash' when iterating over upstream results?","response":"This error occurs when an upstream task returns a single object (Hash) instead of a list (Array). To handle this reliability, add logic to check the size of the results. If `results.size > 1`, proceed with iteration; if `results.size == 1`, handle it as a single object. Alternatively, ensure the upstream transformation forces the output into an array format.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Iterate Task"}
{"instruction":"I am receiving a parameter update error on a workflow migrated from Production to Sandbox. What might be the cause?","response":"This is likely due to the Data Retention (TTL) setting. Production environments often support a `delete_ttl` of 90 days, while Sandboxes are limited to 45 days. To resolve this, export the workflow definition, change `\"delete_ttl\": 90` to `\"delete_ttl\": 45` in the JSON, and re-import it.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Workflow Migration"}
{"instruction":"Why do downloaded PDF files in Workflow have a timestamp suffix, and can I remove it?","response":"Workflow automatically appends a current timestamp to filenames (e.g., `filename_123456789.pdf`) to ensure uniqueness. This is expected behavior. If you need the original filename, you must use Liquid logic to extract or rename the file downstream.","category":"definitional","topic":"File Names"}
{"instruction":"Is it possible to configure an Iterate task to run sequentially instead of in parallel?","response":"No, the Iterate task is designed to run in parallel and cannot be forced to run sequentially. To achieve sequential processing, you must implement a loop pattern where the last task connects back to the first task. Be aware of recursion limits: 100 iterations in Sandbox and 1000 in Production per workflow run. for large volumes, consider batching strategies.","category":"procedural","topic":"Sequential Processing"}
{"instruction":"Can I unzip a bulk ZIP file containing multiple PDFs using the Unzip task in Workflow?","response":"No, the Unzip operation in Workflow is designed for single files only. It does not support extracting multiple files from a single archive. The recommended workaround is to download the PDFs individually and process/send them to SFTP one by one.","category":"procedural","topic":"File Operations"}
{"instruction":"Is Workflow Co-Pilot a separate SKU with additional costs?","response":"No, Workflow Co-Pilot is a platform enhancement and does not require an additional SKU or charge.","category":"definitional","topic":"Pricing"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to cache and reuse external OAuth tokens in a Workflow callout to avoid generating a new token for every execution?","response":"Use **Callout Templates**. First, configure the external OAuth 2.0 provider in `Administration > Manage OAuth 2.0 Providers`. Then, create a Callout Template that uses this provider. Finally, in your Workflow Callout task, select 'Use Callout Template'. The system handles token caching and retries automatically.","category":"best_practice","topic":"OAuth Tokens"}
{"instruction":"Why are my Workflow emails not being received even though the task completes successfully?","response":"Check if the 'Email Preview' setting is enabled on the workflow task. If enabled, the system simulates the email generation but does not actually send it out.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Email Notifications"}
{"instruction":"Can I enable synchronous mode for a workflow to return an immediate response?","response":"No, synchronous workflows are no longer supported or enabled. All workflows must be designed as batch or asynchronous processes.","category":"definitional","topic":"Synchronous Mode"}
{"instruction":"Is subtraction supported in JEXL expressions for Workflow conditions?","response":"Yes, subtraction is supported in common JEXL expressions (e.g., `Account.ValueA - Account.ValueB < Threshold`).","category":"procedural","topic":"JEXL Expressions"}
{"instruction":"Can I filter a Query task directly using fields like 'Is_last_segment'?","response":"No, certain calculated or special fields like `Is_last_segment` are not supported directly in the Query task filters. You must query the data first and then filter the results using Liquid or JSON transformation in a subsequent step.","category":"procedural","topic":"Query Task"}
{"instruction":"How do I resolve an 'Unknown object' error when using {{Callout.Token}} in a Callout task header?","response":"Ensure you have included the full PATH in the Token and Authorize PATH fields in your OAuth configuration. The Authorization Host field should only contain the domain name; if it includes the path, it can cause errors.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Callout Task"}
{"instruction":"Where can I view my Workflow entitlements and consumption in the UI?","response":"Workflow entitlements and consumption are generally only visible in the UI if your tenant is on a Workflow-definition-based license model. If you are on a platform or modular license, this information may not be displayed.","category":"procedural","topic":"Entitlements"}
{"instruction":"Does the standard 'Payment Run' workflow task support Payment Profiles?","response":"No, the standard 'Payment Run' task currently does not support Payment Profiles.","category":"definitional","topic":"Payment Run Task"}
{"instruction":"How can I iterate through an array in reverse order using Liquid?","response":"You can use the `reversed` keyword in your Liquid for loop. For example: `{% for item in Data.Array reversed %}`.","category":"procedural","topic":"Liquid Filters"}
{"instruction":"If I reach my limit of active workflow definitions, can I deactivate one to immediately create a new one?","response":"Yes, deactivating an active workflow definition frees up a slot immediately. There is no waiting period required before you can create a new workflow.","category":"procedural","topic":"Workflow Limits"}
{"instruction":"Why am I getting a NetSuite TBA callout error in my workflow?","response":"Common causes include invalid credentials (especially after a sandbox refresh) or using an outdated hashing algorithm. Ensure you are using **SHA-256**, as SHA-1 is no longer supported by NetSuite.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"NetSuite Integration"}
{"instruction":"How can I transform a date string to the first day of the month using Liquid?","response":"You can use the date filter with a hardcoded day. For example: `{{Data.Workflow.ExecutionDate | date: '%Y-%m-01'}}`.","category":"procedural","topic":"Liquid Filters"}
{"instruction":"Can we toggle the masking of 'secret' Global Constants to make them editable/viewable?","response":"Yes, functionality to toggle masking (marking constants as secret or non-secret) was delivered in version 3.2.0 (approx. Sept 2025). This allows non-secret constants to be editable.","category":"definitional","topic":"Global Constants"}
{"instruction":"Does the Data Query task in Workflow support Multi-Org context automatically?","response":"No, the Data Query task currently does not automatically stick the Org ID to the request, so queries typically default to the default org. The recommended workaround is to create and run separate workflows for each specific org.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"How can I load the contents of a text file into a Liquid variable within a workflow?","response":"You can use the `read_file` filter. The syntax is `{% assign _f = 'FileKey' %} {% assign _file = '' | read_file: _taskId, _f %}`. Note that `FileKey` is the specific key name in the data payload (e.g., 'LockBoxFile'), not the full path.","category":"procedural","topic":"Liquid Filters"}
{"instruction":"What should I do if my JSON Transform task causes a 'Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded' error?","response":"This error often indicates the payload size has exceeded limits (typically 5MB). Even if the input is smaller (e.g., 3MB), the transformation process can expand the data size significantly. You may need to reduce the dataset size, limit rows, or optimize the transformation.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Payload Limits"}
