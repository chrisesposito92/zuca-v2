{"instruction": "Why are users assigned incorrect roles (e.g., \"Finance Team Admin 1\") in OneID after a Central Sandbox (CSBX) refresh from Production, and why is the Save button disabled?", "response": "This issue can occur when the role synchronization between Production and the Central Sandbox (CSBX) encounters a discrepancy during the refresh process, often assigning users to a role that does not exist in the target tenant (e.g., \"Finance Team Admin 1\"). Because the role mapping is invalid, the OneID UI may disable the \"Save\" button, preventing manual correction. To resolve this, Engineering must perform a data fix to remap the affected users to valid roles consistent with Production. As a preventive measure, it is recommended to export user roles prior to a refresh to serve as a baseline and to notify Zuora Support before future refreshes so they can monitor the sync process in real-time.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "OneID role sync after refresh"}

{"instruction": "Why do Salesforce Billing Accounts linked to deleted Zuora accounts persist in Salesforce with a \"DELETE_FAILED\" error?", "response": "This error occurs because the Billing Account object in Salesforce has a custom lookup field (e.g., `Zuora__ZContact__c`) pointing to a Standard Object (Contact/Account). Salesforce disables \"cascade-delete\" by default for custom-to-standard lookups, preventing the Billing Account from being deleted when the parent Zuora account is deleted via the Connector. To resolve this, you must manually clear the value in the custom lookup field (e.g., remove the Contact ID) on the Billing Account record in Salesforce.

{"instruction": "Why does Gateway Reconciliation fail with \"SettlementDateConflict\" errors for Adyen chargebacks?", "response": "The \"SettlementDateConflict\" error occurs when the gateway sends a \"Settlement\" event with a timestamp later than the \"Chargeback\" event for the same transaction. Zuora requires the original transaction to be settled before a chargeback can be applied. If the chronological order of events from the gateway is incorrect (Settlement date > Chargeback date), the reconciliation job rejects the chargeback. However, if the transaction was eventually settled successfully in a previous event, this error may be benign.

{"instruction": "Why did the interest not accelerate on a revenue contract after uploading an SO-modification file, and subsequent reports show a mismatch?", "response": "There are two potential causes for this behavior based on recent incidents. First, if an overstated invoice or SO update is brought in to accelerate interest (with the accelerator flag set to 'Y'), the system requires an updated payment matching the changed sell price. If the payment update is missing, the interest will not recalculate or accelerate. Second, a known bug in the SFC Accelerator process can cause summarization failures (specifically where a flag is not set correctly before calling summarization), leading to discrepancies between the UI (which shows the correct accrual) and reports (which do not).

{"instruction": "Why does the 3DS challenge popup appear in Sandbox even if 'No challenge' is configured in the gateway settings?", "response": "In the Sandbox environment, specific test credit card numbers are hardcoded to trigger different 3DS flows regardless of the gateway configuration. For example, a card starting with 4111... might always trigger a challenge. To test a frictionless flow (no challenge), you must use the specific test card numbers designated for 'frictionless flow' by your gateway provider.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "3DS testing in Sandbox"}
{"instruction": "What is the potential impact of enabling the 'Do not process usage charges without usage records' setting?", "response": "Enabling this setting prevents the system from processing usage charges that have no uploaded records. However, it can negatively impact Bill Run performance over time, as the system may need to scan all past periods to verify if any usage exists before skipping the charge.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Usage rating performance settings"}
{"instruction": "How do I resolve payments that are stuck in 'Processing' status in Zuora?", "response": "To resolve payments stuck in 'Processing', you should first verify the actual status of the transaction in your Payment Gateway console. If the payment was processed or declined there, you can use the specific 'Add Transaction Log' tool in Zuora (typically accessed via `/apps/PaymentLog.do?method=addTransactionLog&paymentID={payment_id}`) to manually update the payment status in Zuora to match the gateway (e.g., 'Approved' or 'GatewayCommunicationError').", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Resolving Stuck Payments"}
{"instruction": "What causes a Journal Run to hang in 'Processing' state indefinitely?", "response": "A Journal Run may hang if the 'Create FX Gain Loss GL Entries' rule is enabled but historical FX rates are missing. The system requires FX rates for all dates from the *first transaction date* onwards to calculate realized gain/loss. If rates are missing for any historical dates involved in the transaction history (even if current dates are present), the job may fail silently or hang. Loading all missing historical FX rates resolves the issue.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Journal Run hung due to missing FX rates"}
{"instruction": "How do I enable the 'Calculated Charge Pricing' model if it is not visible in the UI?", "response": "You can enable the 'Calculated Charge Pricing' model by navigating to **Billing Settings > Enable Charge Types/Model**.

{"instruction": "What is the cause of the 'SFC is accelerating interest without upstream data trigger' issue, and how is it resolved?", "response": "This issue is identified as a bug in the Zuora Revenue 2025.Q3.2.0 release. It occurs when two or more Significant Financing Component (SFC) lines are brought in as part of a Data Collection (DC), where one line has the 'interest accelerator' flag set to 'Y' and another is a normal SFC line. This configuration causes future interest to be calculated in the current open period. The fix involves a code update available in the 2025.Q3.2.0 release. To unblock affected customers prior to the permanent fix, a data fix can be applied to the impacted lines.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Revenue SFC Interest Acceleration"}
{"instruction": "Why does the 'Done' button fail to appear in the new Catalog UI when adding a charge, and is there a workaround?", "response": "The 'Done' button in the bottom right corner of the new Catalog UI may fail to appear due to a styling issue when a rate plan has multiple currencies enabled (specifically greater than or equal to 8).

{"instruction": "Can the name of an Accounting Code be changed once it is created?", "response": "No, once an Accounting Code is in use, its name cannot be changed. Attempting to do so will trigger an error stating the accounting code is in use. To achieve the desired name change, you must create a new Accounting Code with the correct name, update the product catalog to use this new code, and then deactivate the old Accounting Code if it is no longer needed.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Renaming Accounting Codes"}
{"instruction": "Why are revenue events sometimes not recorded in the Revenue Actions History after uploading events?", "response": "A revenue event is created as an audit trail record only when a change results in a modification to the revenue schedule.

This often happens if the external gateway updates its certificates. To resolve this, the external gateway should use a certificate issued by a trusted CA, or the specific Root and Intermediate certificates must be provided to Zuora to be added to the trusted store.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Workflow Email Certificate Error"}
{"instruction": "Why does an invoice link to a subscription version that is different from the version active during the service period dates?", "response": "In Zuora, an invoice is linked to the subscription version that was active immediately before the invoice was created, rather than the version matching the service period dates. For example, if Subscription Version 6 covers August, but Version 7 is created before the August invoice is generated, the invoice will reference Version 7. The latest subscription version acts as a comprehensive record holding historical charge information. This is expected system behavior.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Invoice Subscription Version Linking"}
{"instruction": "How can I resolve the error 'Failed to calculate tax because [ID] tax engine is undefined' after re-enabling a tax engine?", "response": "This error occurs if the system is referencing an old Tax Engine ID that was deleted or disconnected. Even if a new tax engine connection is created with the same name, it will have a new ID. To resolve this, you must re-save the Tax Codes to point to the new Tax Engine connection. If an invoice was created with the old engine ID, unposting it may fail; a workaround is to create a standalone credit memo to zero out the invoice balance, as there is no supported way to bypass the tax engine check for deletion on invoices linked to a deleted engine.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Tax Engine Undefined Error"}
{"instruction": "What are the known limitations and workarounds for Nested Quick Filters and Product Bundling in Zuora Quotes?", "response": "For Nested Quick Filters, there is a limitation of 20 child filters under a single parent quick filter due to performance factors; a workaround is to create additional parent filters (e.g., grouped alphabetically or by region) to distribute the children. Regarding bundling, Zuora Quotes does not have an out-of-the-box bundling feature. However, similar functionality can be achieved using the Zuora Rules Engine to configure rules that automatically add or remove products based on user selection.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Zuora Quotes Limitations"}
{"instruction": "Why do Gateway Reconciliation jobs fail with 'Error Code: Settlement Date Conflict'?", "response": "A 'Settlement Date Conflict' error occurs when the settlement date in the gateway report is earlier than the transaction date already recorded in Zuora. This often happens due to timezone mismatches between the gateway report generation and the Zuora tenant. To prevent this, ensure the gateway's timezone configuration matches the Zuora data center's timezone (typically UTC).

{"instruction": "Why does Attribute-Based Pricing (ABP) result in a $0 price on the invoice even when attributes are mapped correctly?", "response": "A $0 price in ABP usually indicates that the rating engine could not match the usage attributes to a row in the Price Table. Common causes include: 1) The 'Use Attribute-based Pricing' setting is not enabled on the Charge. 2) The attribute names in the usage payload do not exactly match the Price Table column names (including case sensitivity). Note that the Mediation engine replaces spaces with underscores in attribute names (e.g., 'Maturity Months' becomes 'Maturity_Months'), so the input payload and Price Table columns must use the underscore format.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Attribute-Based Pricing Zero Price"}
{"instruction": "What does the error 'Source Not Present' mean in a Gateway Reconciliation job?", "response": "The 'Source Not Present' error in Gateway Reconciliation means that Zuora attempted to retrieve the settlement report file from the gateway, but the file was not yet available on the gateway's server. Zuora typically utilizes a retry mechanism, and the error will clear once the file becomes available and is successfully processed.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Gateway Reconciliation Source Error"}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to delete orphan revenue lines in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "Orphan revenue lines (lines not linked to a transaction) can be deleted if they have not yet been posted.

{"instruction": "Why is unbilled usage not retroactively applying to a newly added prepaid balance fund?", "response": "Prepaid fund drawdowns are determined by the validity period of the fund relative to the usage start date. If unbilled usage occurred before the start date of a new fund (for example, if a top-up was added in the middle of a billing period), the system will not apply that historical usage to the new fund. To resolve this, you can either update the usage start dates to fall within the new fund's validity period or backdate the top-up charge to cover the usage period.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Prepaid Balance Drawdown"}
{"instruction": "How does the Zuora Hosted Payment Method (HPM) iframe ensure security regarding frame ancestors and source directives?", "response": "Zuora uses the `frame-ancestors` directive to restrict the HPM iframe so it only loads on domains explicitly configured and validated by the customer. Regarding `frame-src *`, while this is often required to support dynamic 3DS authentication flows across various payment gateways, the security of the card data is maintained because the data is encrypted within the iframe and transmitted directly to Zuora's backend. It is never stored in the browser or accessible to the parent page.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "HPM Security Architecture"}
{"instruction": "Why might a Workday GL Connector execution status show \"FINISHED\" even if specific sub-tasks like \"Posting JEs\" have failed?", "response": "The overall execution status in the Workday GL Connector often aggregates the completion of attempts rather than the success of every individual line item. If the system successfully attempted the tasks, it may mark the overall run as \"FINISHED.\" Additionally, validation sub-tasks may be marked as successful if they verify data structure or integrity, even if the preceding posting task encountered an error.

{"instruction": "Does amending a subscription in Zuora Billing always create a new Performance Obligation (POB) in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "No, it depends on the type of amendment. Actions like adding a product or renewing a subscription typically create a new Sales Order line and potentially a new POB.

{"instruction": "How are Zephr split testing allocations determined and how long do they persist for a user?", "response": "In Zephr, a user's allocation to a Split Test group is determined at the time of session creation (not when rules are executed). This allocation is 'sticky' and stored in the user's Access Model, meaning it persists across multiple sessions.

{"instruction": "Why does applying multiple payments to the same invoice in a parallel Workflow loop cause balance errors?", "response": "When a Workflow \"For Each\" loop runs in parallel (concurrency > 1), multiple iterations may query the invoice balance simultaneously before any payment is committed. This leads to race conditions where each thread sees the full balance and attempts to apply funds, resulting in an \"Applied balance is greater than the balance\" error. To fix this, process payments sequentially or check the balance immediately before application.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Workflow concurrency management"}
{"instruction": "Why does the Order Preview API return a Delta MRR for a renewal even if the price hasn't changed?", "response": "Unlike Amendment Preview (which calculates delta based on total amount difference), Order Preview calculates Delta MRR based on charge segments. If a charge (e.g., a one-time or fixed period charge) expired before the renewal date, the system treats it as a \"new\" charge segment in the renewal, resulting in a Delta MRR equal to the charge amount.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Order Preview API metrics"}

{"instruction": "How do I configure a scheduled Payment Run to pick up invoices from a daily Auto Bill Run that generates a new Bill Run ID each time?", "response": "You should not link the scheduled Payment Run to a specific, static Bill Run ID, as the ID changes with every auto-execution. Instead, configure the Payment Run to execute daily (after the Bill Run has finished and invoices are posted) and rely on the 'Target Date' logic. This ensures the Payment Run picks up all outstanding, auto-pay enabled invoices due by that date.

{"instruction": "Does the Node SDK support updating Payment Profiles?", "response": "The Node SDK may not explicitly expose specific 'Payment Profile' endpoints if they are missing from the OpenAPI spec (a known parity gap). However, you can typically use the `updatePaymentMethod` operation (`PUT /v1/payment-methods/{id}`) to update payment method details, or use the `createStoredCredentialProfile` and `expireStoredCredentialProfile` methods for credential management. If specific functionality is missing, using the REST API directly is the recommended workaround.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Node SDK Payment Profile limitations"}
{"instruction": "Why do prior period transactions appear in the current period's Transfer Accounting Outbound file?", "response": "This occurs because once an accounting period is closed, no new transactions can be posted to it. Any transactions (or previously held/swept entries) that relate to a closed prior period must be posted in the next available open accounting period.

{"instruction": "Why does the v1 Orders API return `null` for subscription custom fields while the v2 Orders API returns the value?", "response": "The v1 Orders API is designed to return details about the *changes* made in an order. If the custom fields on the subscription were not modified in that specific order, the API response will return them as `null`. The v2 API behaves differently and may aggregate current state. To reliably retrieve the current values of subscription custom fields, it is recommended to use the `GET /v1/subscriptions/{key}` endpoint instead of the Orders API.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "API v1 vs v2 Orders custom fields"}
{"instruction": "What causes the `/v1/orders` API to timeout with a 504 error when creating a future-dated cancellation with `writeOff: true`?", "response": "Including `writeOff: true` in the processing options of an Orders API call can trigger resource-intensive queries (invoice generation and write-off) that may time out (120+ seconds) if there are database performance issues or high data volumes. If this occurs, engineering may need to tune the database query execution plan. A workaround is to separate the operations: perform the subscription cancellation first, and then use the `PUT WriteOffInvoice` API separately.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Orders API timeout with write-off"}
{"instruction": "What could cause a sudden performance degradation in the `/v1/orders/preview` API after a patch release?", "response": "Performance degradation (e.g., increased response time from 2.4s to 3s) after a patch can be caused by suboptimal database query execution plans introduced in the update, or an increase in the number of SQL queries executed during invoice generation. Resolving this typically requires database administrator (DBA) intervention to tune the query execution plans.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Orders Preview API latency"}
{"instruction": "Why am I receiving the error \"A negative Quantity is not allowed\" when uploading usage records?", "response": "This error often occurs if the \"Roll up child usage\" feature is enabled in your Billing Settings.

{"instruction": "How should the Authorization header be formatted when making API calls with an OAuth 2.0 token?", "response": "The Authorization header must be formatted as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Omitting the \"Bearer \" prefix will result in a \"No bearer token\" or authentication error.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "API Authentication"}
{"instruction": "Why does the Extended List Price in RevPro appear significantly higher than the List Price in Billing?", "response": "This usually occurs due to how RevPro calculates term-based values. RevPro calculates Extended List Price by multiplying the Price Plan's list price by the billing frequency and term duration. For example, if a product has an annual list price but the subscription term is 2 years, RevPro may calculate the extended price as 2x the annual price. Verify the pricing model and term duration in the Product Catalog.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "RevPro List Price Calculation"}
{"instruction": "How can I resolve the issue where entities are missing from my OneID account list?", "response": "If entities are missing from your OneID account, they likely need to be migrated under the correct organization within the OneID system.

{"instruction": "Our Advanced Payment Manager (APM) runs are taking significantly longer than usual (e.g., 3-4 hours instead of minutes). What could be the cause and how do we fix it?", "response": "Slow APM runs are often caused by performance bottlenecks in the underlying data retrieval processes, specifically when fetching \"failed payments.\" \n\n**Common Cause:**\nUsing a workflow (e.g., \"Workflow Get Failed Payments\") that queries the `Refund` or `Payment` objects without a date filter. A query like `Refund.Status = 'Processed' ...` without a `CreatedDate` filter forces the system to scan the entire table history, competing for resources with the APM run itself.\n\n**Resolution:**\n1.  **Optimize Workflow Queries:** Review your collection workflows. Ensure all Data Source Export (DSE) or AQuA queries include a date filter (e.g., `CreatedDate >= '2024-01-01'`) to limit the dataset.\n2.  **Engineering Enhancements:** Zuora has implemented backend enhancements to separate the failed payment retrieval logic, which should improve performance.

{"instruction": "How can I rename an Accounting Code that is already \"in use\"?", "response": "Zuora prevents renaming an Accounting Code if it is associated with any transaction or setting. To rename it, you must temporarily disassociate it:\n\n1.  **Product Catalog:** Use the Mass Updater (or Data Source Export/Import) to update all Product Rate Plan Charges currently using the code to a temporary placeholder code.\n2.  **Settings:** Go to **Finance > Manage Accounting Codes** and ensure the code is not set as a default for any transaction type.\n3.  **Rename:** Once the code is not \"in use,\" rename it in the settings.\n4.  **Re-associate:** Update your Product Catalog and Settings to point back to the renamed code.\n\n*Note: Historical transactions will technically point to the same underlying ID, but the name change will reflect for future use.*", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Finance Configuration"}
{"instruction": "What should I do if I encounter \"AsyncApexExecutions Limit exceeded\" errors and high API usage with Zuora 360+ sync?", "response": "High API usage and AsyncApex limits in Salesforce when using Zuora 360+ (Cauldron) are often caused by the **\"Delete & Insert\"** sync behavior (`CAULDRON_DELETE_SUBSCRIPTION_FIRST`). When a subscription is updated in Zuora, this setting deletes the subscription header in Salesforce and recreates it, triggering cascade deletes and re-syncs for all child objects (like Rate Plan Charges). This generates excessive API calls.\n\n**Solution:** Request Zuora Support to change your 360+ subscription sync setting to **\"Upsert\"**.

Tools that can assist include the **Mass Updater** (if you have Zuora Finance enabled) or the **Generic API Loader** (which requires a Developer Tools subscription).", "category": "definitional", "topic": "API Sandbox Refresh Policy"}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to roll back or delete a single Revenue Contract (RCID) in RevPro Production?", "response": "No, it is not possible to roll back or delete a single Revenue Contract (RCID) in RevPro Production. The only option to revert data is a full production environment restore from a backup, which will revert *all* data to the backup point.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "RevPro Data Rollback"}
{"instruction": "How do I resolve the \"Duplicates in data sync object mapping\" error during Revenue Sync?", "response": "This error occurs when a source field (e.g., `Account.CreatedDate`) is mapped more than once in the RevPro data sync configuration (e.g., mapped to multiple target fields like `CF14` and another field). You must review your mapping configuration and remove any duplicate field mappings.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Revenue Sync Duplicate Mapping"}
{"instruction": "How can I track historical changes to Account fields like VAT ID?", "response": "You can track field-level changes if the **Audit Trail** feature is enabled on your tenant. This logs changes in the `auditobjectchangeevent` table for objects like Account. If Audit Trail is not enabled, Zuora does not retain accessible field-level history in the UI for retrieval.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Account Audit Trail"}
{"instruction": "What is the correct endpoint for retrieving a Product in the REST API (v1)?", "response": "As of recent updates (e.g., Billing 344), the standard endpoint is `/v1/catalog/products/{id}` (plural). While the singular version (`/product/{id}`) may be supported for backward compatibility, it is recommended to use the plural form `products` as reflected in the updated API reference.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "REST API Product Endpoint"}
{"instruction": "What is the process for extracting sensitive ACH/Bank Transfer data (account numbers) from Zuora?", "response": "Extracting full ACH data requires a special request. The customer must sign a legal indemnification waiver and provide a public GPG key (minimum 3072-bit RSA, 4096-bit recommended). Once configured by Zuora Engineering, the data can be exported via **Data Source Export** > **Payment Method**, ensuring the export is encrypted with the provided key.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Sensitive Payment Data Extraction"}
{"instruction": "Why do APM/CPR retry attempts use an old Payment Method even after I updated the subscription with a new one?", "response": "APM (Automated Payment Manager) and CPR processes reference the Payment Method associated with the specific subscription version that the invoice was generated for. If you create a *new* subscription version (amendment) to change the Payment Method, existing invoices/retries may still reference the *old* version's Payment Method. To fix this, you must update the Payment Method field on the *historical version* of the subscription linked to the invoice.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "APM Payment Method Logic"}
{"instruction": "How can I filter a report or data export for multiple specific accounts?", "response": "You can use the \"IN\" condition in your filter logic (e.g., `Account ID IN ('id1', 'id2')`) to retrieve data for multiple specific accounts in a single report or SQL query.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Reporting Filter Logic"}
{"instruction": "How do I resolve the \"orderActions total number exceeds the size limitation\" error in Workflows?", "response": "The synchronous Order API (`POST /v1/orders`) has a limit of 50 order actions per call. To resolve this error, either split your request into smaller batches (under 50 actions) or use the **Create Order Asynchronously** API (`POST /v1/async/orders`), which supports up to 300 order actions in a single request.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Order API Limits"}
{"instruction": "Can I filter the List Subscriptions REST API by charge type or charge model?", "response": "No, the REST API `GET /v2/subscriptions` does not currently support filtering by `charge_type` or `charge_model`. You must use **Data Source Exports (DSE)** or **Data Query (DQ)** to filter subscriptions based on these charge-level attributes.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "API Filtering Capabilities"}
{"instruction": "Where can I find installation links for specific versions of Zuora Quotes?", "response": "Installation links for Zuora Quotes packages are typically provided in the Zuora Knowledge Center under the \"Zuora Quotes\" section or within the specific Release Notes for that version.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Zuora Quotes Installation"}
{"instruction": "What SSH key format is required for the Workflow SFTP Upload task?", "response": "The Workflow SFTP Upload task currently only supports the **PEM** key format. It does not support OPENSSH format keys. You must convert your key to PEM format (e.g., using `ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f private_key`) before using it in the task.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Workflow SFTP Key Format"}
{"instruction": "Why are Journal Entries missing for transactions (like Credit Memo applications) that occurred on the last day of the period?", "response": "If a Journal Run was executed *before* the transaction was fully processed or applied (even if the transaction date falls within the period), the entry will be missed. You must execute a new Journal Run for that accounting period to pick up any transactions that occurred or were finalized after the previous run. Zuora will not create duplicate entries for transactions already processed.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Missing Journal Entries"}
{"instruction": "How do I enable Advanced Charge Models like Pre-rated Pricing or High Water Mark?", "response": "These features (Advanced Charge Models) must be enabled by Zuora Support. Please submit a ticket requesting the enablement of specific models like Pre-rated Per Unit or High Water Mark for your tenant.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Advanced Charge Model Enablement"}
{"instruction": "Why are email notifications (e.g., for Invoice Posting) not being sent even though the notification is enabled?", "response": "Check the **Communication Profile** assigned to the account. If the profile itself is set to **Muted**, no emails will be sent regardless of the individual notification settings enabled. Un-mute the profile to resume email delivery.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Email Notification Delivery"}
{"instruction": "How do I access Advanced Revenue features like POB Bundles or SSP Allocations in RevPro?", "response": "These features are part of the \"Advanced Revenue\" package. If they are missing from your menu, you must request Zuora Support to enable specific settings such as POB Bundles, SSP Allocations, Contract Modifications, and Variable Consideration for your tenant.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "RevPro Feature Enablement"}
