{"instruction": "How do I recognize revenue for a subscription with a promotional period at a different price?", "response": "For subscriptions with promotional/introductory pricing, you need **separate charges for each pricing period**, each mapped to the appropriate POB template.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n**1.

Map Each to BK-OT-RATABLE:**\nBoth charges use the same template but with different:\n- Effective dates (promo: months 1-3, standard: months 4-12)\n- Sell prices ($15 vs $20)\n- Recognition windows (matching effective dates)\n\n**Example - 12-Month Subscription:**\nPromo: $15/month for 3 months = $45\nStandard: $20/month for 9 months = $180\nTotal contract: $225\n\n**Waterfall Output:**\n- Jan: $15 (promo charge)\n- Feb: $15 (promo charge)\n- Mar: $15 (promo charge)\n- Apr-Dec: $20/month (standard charge)\n\n**Why Not One Charge?**\n- Single charge would average to $18.75/month\n- This misrepresents the economics of each period\n- Doesn't reflect the actual pricing structure\n- May cause issues with SSP allocation if different POBs involved\n\n**POB Mapping:**\n- Both charges → BK-OT-RATABLE\n- Promo recognition window: Jan 1 - Mar 31\n- Standard recognition window: Apr 1 - Dec 31\n\nNote: These are custom templates in internal demo tenants.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Promotional pricing recognition"}
