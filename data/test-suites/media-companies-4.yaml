The customer is billed a one-time upfront payment of $89.99 USD for a 12-month term. This plan is non-refundable, creating a clear 12-month commitment. The billing occurs annually at the start of the term. From a revenue perspective, the $89.99 is recognized ratably over the 365-day contract period. This use case highlights Zuora’s capacity to manage annual renewals and long-term deferred revenue schedules for prepaid B2C services."

      use_case_description: "This use case explores the AMC+ Premium Bundle, which includes Shudder, Sundance Now, and IFC Films Unlimited for a single price of $9.99 USD per month. While the customer sees a single 'Bundle' charge, AMC Networks needs to allocate the $9.99 across these three distinct services for internal brand performance tracking. We will model this using Zuora Revenue's allocation engine. We assume standalone selling prices (SSP) of $8.99 for Shudder, $6.99 for Sundance Now, and $5.99 for IFC Films. The $9.99 transaction price will be allocated proportionally based on these SSPs. Each allocated portion will then be recognized ratably over the monthly term. This demonstrates sophisticated revenue management for multi-product bundles."

This scenario exercises Zuora’s 'Ramp' functionality within a single rate plan or via a discount charge.
