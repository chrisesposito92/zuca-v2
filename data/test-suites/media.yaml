This is a recurring monthly subscription with no fixed term, though we will model it as a 12-month evergreen-style contract for revenue purposes. Because the bundle price ($37.95) is significantly lower than the sum of the individual list prices (~$67), revenue must be allocated across each service POB based on their standalone selling prices.

After the 3-month promotion expires, the subscription automatically converts to the standard monthly recurring rate of $12.99. This is modeled in Zuora using a 'Ramp' structure or a multi-period rate plan charge. For demo purposes, we assume revenue for the $0.00 period is zero, and revenue recognition starts when the paid monthly cycles begin.

After 15 days, the user decides to upgrade to the 'Standard' (Ad-Free) plan at $17.99 per month to avoid interruptions and enable downloads. This use case exercises Zuora's Order Actions for product amendments and proration logic. The system must calculate the credit for the remaining 15 days of the 'with Ads' plan and the additional charge for the 15 days of the 'Standard' plan. Revenue recognition follows the service period, adjusting the daily rate upon the effective date of the upgrade. This highlights Zuora's precision in handling mid-cycle plan migrations."

The list price of $17.99 per unit is discounted by 20% to $14.39 per unit per month due to the volume commitment. The contract is set for a 12-month term with annual upfront billing totaling $8,634.00. This scenario requires Zuora to handle a high-volume subscription with a percentage-based discount. Because the discount applies to a single performance obligation (the subscription service) across multiple units, revenue is recognized ratably over the 12-month term. This demonstrates Zuora's capability in the B2B/Partner space beyond simple consumer billing."
