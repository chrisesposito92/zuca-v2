To support the office staff, they also include 100 Dialpad Connect Enterprise seats at a discounted rate of $30 per user per month. The deal includes a professional services package for $5,000 to handle complex IVR mapping and CRM integration. Because the bundle includes a significant discount on the Connect seats, revenue allocation is required between the subscription services and the professional services based on list prices.
