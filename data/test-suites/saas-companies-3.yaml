The customer expects to add seats frequently throughout the month, requiring Zuora to handle prorated charges and automated invoicing on a monthly cadence. The subscription is a standard recurring charge with no fixed term, though we will model it as a 12-month evergreen-style contract for the workflow. Revenue for the subscription seats is recognized ratably over each monthly billing period. No discounts are applied in this scenario, keeping it a straightforward monthly recurring revenue (MRR) model."
