      use_case_description: "A high-volume enterprise merchant has negotiated a custom rate to move away from the standard 5% fee. The negotiated rate is 3% + $0.30 per transaction for the Merchant of Record Core. This contract has a 24-month term with a minimum monthly processing commitment of $50,000. If the merchant processes less than the commitment, they are billed a true-up fee to meet the minimum. This scenario exercises Zuora's capability to handle custom pricing tiers and minimum commitment logic. Revenue for the transaction fees is recognized as billed, while any true-up is recognized at the end of the billing period."
