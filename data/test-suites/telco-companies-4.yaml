      use_case_description: "A mid-market customer signs a 12-month contract for 50 seats of the GoTo Connect CX Plan. The subscription is priced at $34 per user per month, billed annually upfront. In addition to the recurring seats, the deal includes a one-time 'Managed Implementation Services' fee of $2,500 for account configuration and number porting. Revenue for the subscription seats is recognized ratably over the 12-month term, while the implementation fee is recognized at the point of go-live. This scenario tests the ability to combine recurring SaaS seats with a distinct professional services performance obligation."

      use_case_description: "An enterprise customer purchases 25 agents for the GoTo Contact Center Plan at $80 per agent per month, along with 25 VoIP Desk Phones (hardware) at $150 per device. The contract is for 24 months, billed annually for the software and one-time for the hardware. To win the deal, a 15% discount is applied to the total contract value, requiring revenue allocation between the hardware (delivered at start) and the subscription (delivered over 24 months). The hardware revenue should be recognized upon delivery, while the subscription revenue is ratable. This scenario exercises multi-element arrangements with discounts and physical goods."

In addition to the base subscription, the account is configured for international usage overages to cover calls to countries not included in the standard 50-country list. These usage charges are billed in arrears at a rate of $0.05 per minute. Revenue for the base seats is recognized ratably each month, while the usage revenue is recognized as consumption occurs.
