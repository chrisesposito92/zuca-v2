The bundle is sold at a discounted total price of $19.99. Because the bundle contains two distinct performance obligations—the streaming service (ratable) and the event ticket (point-in-time)—revenue allocation is required. The $19.99 transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone selling prices (list prices) of the two items. This scenario exercises Zuora Revenue's allocation engine."
