      use_case_description: "This scenario involves a customer utilizing a $25.00 Paramount+ Gift Card to fund a 'Paramount+ Essential' monthly subscription. The gift card is treated as a one-time charge of $25.00, which creates a credit balance on the account. The subscription is a recurring charge of $7.99 per month, which draws down from the credit balance until exhausted. Revenue for the gift card is initially deferred and recognized as consumption (as the credit is applied to invoices), while the subscription revenue itself is recognized ratably over each service month. This use case explores the interaction between one-time credit products and recurring subscription services and demonstrates complex revenue recognition across different charge types."
