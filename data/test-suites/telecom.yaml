      use_case_description: "A consumer subscribes to the 'Unlimited Premium PL' wireless plan for $85.99 per month. Along with the service, they purchase a high-end smartphone for $799.99, which is financed through a 36-month interest-free installment plan at $22.22 per month. The wireless service is a recurring monthly charge billed in advance. Although the hardware is paid monthly, the full revenue for the device is recognized upfront at the point of delivery, while the service revenue is recognized ratably each month. This scenario demonstrates Zuora's ability to handle recurring service billing alongside hardware installment plans with divergent revenue recognition patterns."

The pricing follows a volume-tiered model: the first 4 lines are priced at $45.00 per line, and lines 5 through 10 are priced at $35.00 per line. Additionally, the customer opts for a 'Business Security Add-on' at $5.00 per line across all 10 lines. The contract term is 12 months with monthly billing. Revenue for all components is recognized ratably over the 12-month term as the service is delivered. This scenario tests Zuora's ability to handle tiered pricing models within a single rate plan."
