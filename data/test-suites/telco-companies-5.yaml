The contract includes a one-time Managed Install Service fee of $1,500 for network auditing and admin training. Additionally, the customer will be billed monthly in arrears for any international calling usage and toll-free overages exceeding their 1,000-minute monthly allowance, estimated at $0.05 per minute. The subscription and service fees are billed annually upfront. Revenue for the CX seats is recognized ratably over the 12-month term, while the install service is recognized as a point-in-time obligation upon the completion of the go-live phase."

      use_case_description: "A large enterprise customer deploys the Contact Center solution for 150 agents at a discounted rate of $72 per user per month (10% off list price of $80). To support the rollout, they purchase 75 Yealink IP Phones upfront at $189 per device. Because the hardware and subscription are sold as a discounted bundle, revenue must be allocated between the hardware (point-in-time) and the subscription (over-time) based on their standalone selling prices to comply with ASC 606. The contract term is 24 months with quarterly billing. Revenue for the hardware is recognized upon delivery to the customer sites, while the contact center seats are recognized ratably over the 24-month term."
