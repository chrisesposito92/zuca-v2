    name: billing-period-alignment
    description: Invoices must align with billing periods
    severity: critical
    patterns: [billing period, invoice date, monthly, quarterly]
    check:
      type: behavioral
      rule: |
        Invoice dates must align with the billing period:
        - Monthly: one invoice per month
        - Quarterly: one invoice per quarter
        - Annually: one invoice per year
        Invoice dates should be at period start (in advance) or
        end (in arrears) based on billing timing.

  - id: BL-002
    name: invoice-amount-accuracy
    description: Invoice amounts must match contracted prices per period
    severity: critical
    patterns: [invoice amount, price, billing amount]
    check:
      type: numeric
      rule: |
        Each invoice amount must equal:
        Unit Price × Quantity × Periods in that invoice cycle
        For ramp scenarios, the amount changes when the
        new pricing period begins.
      threshold: 0.01
    examples:
      passing:
        - scenario: "3 months @ $15/month, then 9 months @ $20/month"
          expected: "First 3 invoices: $15 each, Next 9 invoices: $20 each"
      failing:
        - scenario: "3 months @ $15, then 9 months @ $20"
          incorrect: "All 12 invoices at $18.75 average"
          why: "Invoice amounts must reflect actual contracted price per period"

    name: proration-handling
    description: Partial periods must be prorated correctly
    severity: high
    patterns: [proration, partial period, mid-month, mid-cycle]
    check:
      type: behavioral
      rule: |
        If service starts or ends mid-period, the first/last
        invoice must be prorated based on days of service.
        Proration = (Days of Service / Days in Period) × Full Amount

  - id: BL-004
    name: service-period-coverage
    description: Billing schedule must cover entire service period
    severity: critical
    patterns: [service period, coverage, billing schedule]
    check:
      type: behavioral
      rule: |
        The sum of all billing periods must exactly cover
        the service period from start to end date.
        No gaps or overlaps in the billing schedule.

  - id: BL-005
    name: payment-term-consistency
    description: Payment terms must be consistent across invoices
    severity: medium
    patterns: [payment terms, net 30, due date]
    check:
      type: behavioral
      rule: |
        Payment terms (e.g., Net 30, Due on Receipt) should
        be consistent across all invoices unless the contract
        specifies different terms for different periods.

  - id: BL-006
    name: billing-timing-accuracy
    description: Billing timing must match contract terms
    severity: high
    patterns: [in advance, in arrears, billing timing]
    check:
      type: behavioral
      rule: |
        Invoices must be dated according to billing timing:
        - "In Advance": Invoice at start of service period
        - "In Arrears": Invoice at end of service period
        Service Period dates on each invoice must reflect this.

  - id: BL-007
    name: charge-description-accuracy
    description: Invoice line descriptions must be clear and accurate
    severity: medium
    patterns: [description, line item, charge name]
    check:
      type: behavioral
      rule: |
        Each invoice line should clearly describe:
        - The service/product being billed
        - The billing period covered
        For ramps, indicate which pricing tier applies.

  - id: BL-008
    name: total-contract-value
    description: Sum of all invoices must equal total contract value
    severity: critical
    patterns: [total, contract value, sum]
    check:
      type: numeric
      rule: |
        The sum of all invoice amounts must equal the
        Total Contract Value (TCV) from the subscription spec.
        Sum(all invoice amounts) = TCV
      threshold: 0.01
