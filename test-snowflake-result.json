    "use_case_description": "Snowflake signs a 3-year enterprise Order Form for the Snowflake AI Data Cloud modeled as a capacity commitment (prepaid consumption credits) with an annual ramp and an on-demand overage rate once the committed balance is exhausted. Create a Subscription with a Ramp (or three annual segments) for the Capacity Commitment rate plan: Year 1 committed spend $750,000 billed annually in advance; Year 2 $1,250,000 billed annually in advance; Year 3 $2,000,000 billed annually in advance (all demo pricing). Treat the committed spend as a prepaid drawdown balance that is relieved as usage occurs, using usage imports (e.g., credits consumed) to drive recognition rather than straight-line over the year. Add a separate Usage charge for Overage Consumption billed monthly in arrears at $5.75 per credit once the committed credit balance is depleted (and/or for usage explicitly classified as overage), with invoices generated monthly based on usage records. Optionally include metered storage as a separate usage component at $30 per TB-month billed monthly in arrears (kept separate from the committed credit pool for demo clarity). Include a Professional Services rate plan for implementation/migration/training sold alongside the commit as a fixed-fee SOW: $200,000 total, invoiced 50% at kickoff and 50% at go-live, with the commercial intent that services support adoption of the platform during Year 1. Apply a negotiated bundle discount of 10% off list across the committed spend and services to force allocation in revenue (allocate discount across POBs using list prices as SSP proxies). Revenue expectation (inferred): committed capacity is recognized as the customer consumes credits (release from deferred as-used); overage and storage are recognized as-used/as-billed in the monthly period; services are recognized as delivered (over time or at milestone depending on SOW acceptance criteria)."

      "The Capacity Commitment Prepayment POB template provided indicates 'Upon Booking (Full Booking Release)'. Should the prepayment instead be treated as deferred and recognized only upon usage drawdown (i.e., a liability/deferred revenue relief driven by usage), or is the provided template intentional for this demo?",
      "Should Zuora Revenue ramp allocation (average pricing across ramp periods) be enabled for the 3-year capacity commitment, or should the three annual segments remain separately allocated/recognized as modeled here?",
      "What is the conversion between committed spend dollars and committed consumption credits (i.e., how many credits are loaded into the prepaid balance for each year) to support the drawdown usage events?",
      "Is Metered Storage definitively included in the order form, or is it optional and should be excluded from the subscription if not sold?",
      "Are the Professional Services milestones both expected to occur on 2026-01-01, or is there a later Go-Live date/milestone acceptance date that should drive the EVT-PIT-COMPLETION release?",
      "Should the 10% bundle discount also apply to overage and/or storage usage rates, or are those strictly pay-as-you-go at list?"

    "open_questions": [
      "[BLOCKING] What is the intended revenue treatment for the annual capacity prepayment lines in Zuora Revenue: should they remain deferred and be released only via drawdown/usage (as the business intent states), or should they follow the currently referenced template behavior of “Upon Booking (Full Booking Release)” (which would recognize upfront and contradict usage-based recognition intent)? (This determines the core POB template/mapping and the entire revenue schedule.)",
      "[BLOCKING] What is the contractual conversion/entitlement between committed spend and credits (credits loaded into the prepaid balance for each year)? Is it fixed (e.g., $/credit) or dollar-based with variable effective pricing? (This is required to operationalize PPDD drawdown and to interpret usage quantities against the prepaid pool.)",
      "[BLOCKING] What is the contractual Go-Live definition and the actual Go-Live/acceptance date for the professional services milestone? Should the go-live milestone use a specific trigger date / explicit revenue event date? (This drives both billing timing and revenue release timing for PS.)",
      "[HIGH] Billing design decision: should drawdown usage create $0 invoice items (invoiceable) or be non-billable usage used only for prepaid depletion and revenue release? Alternatively, should it generate invoice lines that are automatically offset/applied to prepaid balance? (This impacts billing operations, invoice artifacts, and downstream integrations.)",
      "[HIGH] Are overage and/or storage truly excluded from allocation as variable consideration for demo purposes, or should they be allocation-eligible and included in the arrangement consideration framework? (This affects SSP allocation scope and revenue disclosure outputs.)",
      "[HIGH] Should Zuora Revenue ramp allocation/averaging across ramp periods be enabled for the 3-year arrangement, or should each annual segment remain a distinct POB/credit pool with separate allocation as currently modeled? (This changes allocated amounts and potentially recognition by year.)",
      "[HIGH] Confirm whether Metered Storage is actually sold on this order form or is optional and should be omitted from the subscription. (This affects product catalog, invoicing, and rev rec scope.)",
      "[MEDIUM] Discount scope: should the 10% bundle discount also apply to overage and/or storage usage rates, or are those strictly pay-as-you-go at list? (This affects invoiced amounts and could affect revenue if included in allocation scope.)",
      "[MEDIUM] Billing timing for annual prepayments: should Year 1/2/3 be billed on each anniversary (2026-01-01, 2027-01-01, 2028-01-01) as modeled, or should all three years be billed upfront on 2026-01-01? (This affects cash, AR, and billing schedules; revenue may still be usage-driven depending on configuration.)",
      "[MEDIUM] Discount presentation: should the 10% discount be modeled as net pricing (sellPrice < listPrice, as assumed) or as separate discount charge lines for invoice transparency? (This impacts invoice layout and some reporting.)",
      "[DATA NEEDED] Provide committed drawdown consumption events (e.g., monthly credits consumed, and any rules about which annual pool is depleted first). (Without this, usage-driven revenue release for committed capacity cannot be illustrated beyond setup.)",
      "[DATA NEEDED] Provide overage billing/usage events by month (usage quantities and/or invoice/bill-run dates and amounts). (Without this, monthly billed-period revenue for overage cannot be populated.)",
      "[DATA NEEDED] Provide storage billing/usage events by month (TB-month quantities and/or invoice/bill-run dates and amounts), if storage is in-scope. (Without this, monthly billed-period revenue for storage cannot be populated.)",
      "[NICE-TO-KNOW] For the committed capacity lines treated as consumption-driven/VC templates, what is the intended constrained estimate methodology and any expected true-ups (timing/amounts)? (This affects whether rip/replace adjustments should be modeled beyond the simplified assumption of “no VC true-ups.”)"
