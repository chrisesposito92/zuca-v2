    "use_case_description": "Salesforce sells an enterprise multi-cloud agreement that includes Sales Cloud (Enterprise) and Service Cloud (Enterprise) user licenses, plus a fixed-scope implementation services package and instructor-led training for admins/agents. The subscription portion is modeled as two separate product rate plans: (1) Sales Cloud (Enterprise) with a recurring per-user charge at $175/user/month billed annually, and (2) Service Cloud (Enterprise) with a recurring per-user charge at $175/user/month billed annually; the initial order is for 2,000 Sales Cloud users and 1,200 Service Cloud users. As part of the enterprise bundle, the customer negotiates a single commercial discount that reduces total contract consideration by ~15% versus combined list pricing across the subscription and services components, so we expect allocation across multiple performance obligations using SSP/list prices. Add Premier Success Plan as an attached subscription add-on rate plan priced at 30% of net license fees (calculated from the discounted Sales+Service license amount) and billed on the same annual schedule. Implementation Services are sold as a separate services product rate plan with a one-time fixed fee list price of $150,000 (discounted in the deal to $135,000) invoiced 50% at kickoff and 50% at go-live/acceptance. Trailhead Academy training is sold as a separate product rate plan with one-time per-attendee charges at $3,000 per attendee per course; the customer prepurchases 60 seats (list $180,000) discounted to $153,000 and training is delivered in the first 90 days. Mid-term expansion: on 07/01/2026 the customer adds 200 additional Service Cloud users co-termed to the 12-month agreement with proration for the remaining term and billed on the next invoice. Revenue expectation (inferred): subscriptions (including Success Plan) recognized ratably over the term; implementation recognized over time as services are performed (or by milestone if that best reflects progress); training recognized when delivered."

      "Commercial construct & scope: One enterprise agreement bundles (a) Sales Cloud Enterprise user subscriptions, (b) Service Cloud Enterprise user subscriptions, (c) fixed-scope Implementation Services, and (d) Trailhead Academy instructor-led training seats; Premier Success Plan is an attached subscription add-on priced as a formula based on license fees.",
      "Contract term & currency: Initial subscription term is assumed to be 12 months from 2026-01-01 through 2026-12-31, in USD.",
      "Billing cadence (subscriptions): License subscriptions and Premier Success Plan are billed annually in advance for the term starting 2026-01-01; the mid-term expansion is invoiced on/near its effective date (assumed 2026-07-01) as the 'next invoice'.",
      "Product/rate plan modeling: Sales Cloud and Service Cloud are modeled as separate recurring per-user charges; Implementation and Training are modeled as separate one-time service/product rate plans; Premier Success Plan is modeled as a separate add-on subscription charge.",
      "List price (SSP) basis: Revenue allocation SSP is assumed to be the listPrice on each line (allocation method = use list price), and all relevant lines are marked allocation-eligible.",
      "Discount representation (billing): The negotiated bundle discount is represented via per-charge sellPrice overrides (no separate discount rate plan/discount charge line is created), while listPrice is retained for SSP-based allocation.",
      "Discount math assumption for licenses: Because an explicit net license unit price was not provided, license net pricing is assumed to reflect an ~15% overall commercial discount vs combined list across non-Success-Plan components; a uniform net factor is applied to Sales Cloud and Service Cloud licenses (resulting in ~$148.75/user/month, i.e., $1,785/user/year).",
      "Annual price conversion & proration: Annual billing is implemented by setting billingPeriod=Year and converting $175/user/month to $2,100/user/year list; proration for partial terms is assumed to be supported by Zuora for co-termed segments.",
      "Premier Success Plan pricing: Premier Success Plan sell price is assumed to be 30% of net (discounted) license fees for the billed period; its SSP/list is assumed to be 30% of list license fees for the term.",
      "Initial quantities: Initial order quantities are assumed to be 2,000 Sales Cloud users and 1,200 Service Cloud users for the full 12-month term.",
      "Mid-term expansion modeling: On 2026-07-01, 200 additional Service Cloud users are added co-termed to 2026-12-31 as a prospective modification; expansion pricing is assumed prorated for the remaining term and allocated standalone for that modification.",
      "Expansion proration convention: Expansion proration is assumed to be a clean 6/12 of the annual price for 2026-07-01 through 2026-12-31 (no day-count convention applied).",
      "Implementation fee & invoicing: Implementation Services list is $150,000 and is discounted in the deal to $135,000; invoicing is assumed 50% at kickoff and 50% at go-live/acceptance.",
      "Implementation milestone dates (working assumptions): Kickoff is assumed 2026-01-01; go-live/acceptance is inconsistently assumed across steps (either 2026-03-31 for rev rec/event recognition or 2026-01-01 for invoicing), implying the current billing vs revenue schedules may be misaligned until dates are confirmed.",
      "Training pricing & billing: Training is modeled as 60 prepaid seats with list $180,000 discounted to $153,000 (net $2,550 per seat); billed at contract effective/start (assumed 2026-01-01).",
      "Training delivery & recognition: Training is assumed delivered within the first 90 days; however, because no actual delivery/consumption events were provided, the revenue model assumes no releases occur (revenue remains deferred) within the current reporting horizon unless events are supplied.",
      "Revenue recognition policy (subscriptions): Subscription licenses and Premier Success Plan are recognized ratably over the service term.",

      "Allocation timing & journal initialization: Allocation is assumed performed at initial booking (subscription version 1), producing allocated revenue amounts that may differ from sell; unreleased revenue is initialized to allocated price and released revenue starts at 0 (per instruction).",

      "[BLOCKING] For Implementation Services, should revenue be recognized strictly by milestones or over time using a progress measure? If over time, provide POB template(s), service period dates, and progress methodology (e.g., cost-to-cost, labor hours).",
      "[BLOCKING] Provide the Training delivery/consumption schedule (dates/sessions, seats delivered per date) and confirm whether seats expire; without events, Zuora Revenue cannot release training revenue appropriately.",
      "[HIGH] Confirm the intended discounting approach across components: a single blended commercial discount applied uniformly to all non-formula components vs using only the explicitly stated discounts (Implementation 10%, Training 15%) with potentially different license discounting. (This drives sell prices, allocation, and reporting.)",
      "[HIGH] Confirm the Premier Success Plan behavior for mid-term expansions: should it automatically adjust to 30% of incremental net license fees for added users and be prorated/invoiced at expansion (2026-07-01)? (Affects billing, modification modeling, and revenue.)",
      "[HIGH] Confirm the proration convention for the 2026-07-01 expansion (exact day-count vs month-based) and the exact billed-through end date for the co-termed segment (e.g., through 2026-12-31). (Affects invoice amount and revenue schedules.)",
      "[HIGH] Should the 2026-07-01 expansion be invoiced immediately on/after 2026-07-01 or only on the next scheduled annual invoice date per operational practice? (Affects cash, AR, and timing of billed amounts.)",
      "[MEDIUM] How should the negotiated discount be implemented in Zuora Billing operationally: price overrides (sellPrice), an explicit discount charge, or a discount percentage plan? (Affects auditability, amendment behavior, and downstream integrations.)",
      "[MEDIUM] Are any lines intended to be excluded from allocation eligibility under your Zuora Revenue configuration (e.g., certain services, training, or specific milestones)? (Affects allocation and revenue postings.)",
      "[MEDIUM] Are renewals in scope (auto-renewal, renewal term length, and whether pricing/products carry forward)? (Affects forward-looking order setup and forecasting, not initial-year accounting.)",
      "[LOW] Are there any additional contract modifications after 2026-07-01 (price changes, further expansions, partial terminations)? (Affects later-period billing and revenue waterfall accuracy.)"
