{"instruction": "Why are users assigned incorrect roles (e.g., \"Finance Team Admin 1\") in OneID after a Central Sandbox (CSBX) refresh from Production, and why is the Save button disabled?", "response": "This issue can occur when the role synchronization between Production and the Central Sandbox (CSBX) encounters a discrepancy during the refresh process, often assigning users to a role that does not exist in the target tenant (e.g., \"Finance Team Admin 1\"). Because the role mapping is invalid, the OneID UI may disable the \"Save\" button, preventing manual correction. To resolve this, Engineering must perform a data fix to remap the affected users to valid roles consistent with Production. As a preventive measure, it is recommended to export user roles prior to a refresh to serve as a baseline and to notify Zuora Support before future refreshes so they can monitor the sync process in real-time.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "OneID role sync after refresh"}
{"instruction": "What causes an Internal Server Error (500) with code 51500060 when calling v2 APIs in a Multi-Org environment?", "response": "A 500 Internal Server Error with code 51500060 on v2 APIs (such as v2/Orders) in a Multi-Org environment is typically caused by the API user lacking access permissions to one or more of the organizations involved in the request. The v2 API has a known limitation where it fails with a generic internal error instead of a specific permission error in this scenario. To resolve this, ensure the API user is granted access to all relevant organizations. Alternatively, consider using v1 APIs, which do not have this specific gap.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "v2 API Multi-Org permissions"}
{"instruction": "Why do Salesforce Billing Accounts linked to deleted Zuora accounts persist in Salesforce with a \"DELETE_FAILED\" error?", "response": "This error occurs because the Billing Account object in Salesforce has a custom lookup field (e.g., `Zuora__ZContact__c`) pointing to a Standard Object (Contact/Account). Salesforce disables \"cascade-delete\" by default for custom-to-standard lookups, preventing the Billing Account from being deleted when the parent Zuora account is deleted via the Connector. To resolve this, you must manually clear the value in the custom lookup field (e.g., remove the Contact ID) on the Billing Account record in Salesforce. Once the lookup relationship is severed, the Billing Account can be successfully deleted.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Salesforce Connector sync deletion"}
{"instruction": "Why are custom fields (e.g., OfferID__c, Country__c) missing from Product Catalog exports or Data Source Exports even though they appear in the UI?", "response": "This issue may be caused by a metadata mismatch in the Data Source Export framework where the system joins the wrong table (e.g., `zb_rateplan_cf` instead of `zb_product_rateplan_cf`) due to a legacy object type definition. This can happen even if the fields are visible in the UI and retrievable via REST API or Data Query. A data fix is required from Zuora Engineering to synchronize the custom field IDs between the new and old plan tables to ensure the export framework queries the correct data source.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Product Catalog export missing fields"}
{"instruction": "Why is the Multi-Org organization panel missing from the UI after enabling the feature?", "response": "The Multi-Org UI panel may fail to load if there is a \"Required\" custom field on the `AccountingPeriod` object. The system authentication process for Multi-Org can fail when trying to validate required custom fields on this specific object. To resolve this, you must delete the required custom field from the `AccountingPeriod` object. If the new Object Manager UI prevents deletion due to the error, use the Legacy Custom Field UI to perform the deletion. Once deleted, the Multi-Org panel should appear.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Multi-Org UI visibility"}
{"instruction": "What causes intermittent 403 Forbidden errors on the /oauth/token endpoint when credentials are correct?", "response": "If valid OAuth credentials suddenly start returning 403 Forbidden errors and Zuora logs show no record of the requests reaching the platform, the traffic is likely being blocked upstream by an external network component, middleware, or cloud provider (e.g., Azure region issues). In such cases, the request never reaches Zuora to be authenticated or rejected. Workarounds may include changing the source region of the request or investigating the outbound network path/firewalls on the client side.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "OAuth token 403 errors"}
{"instruction": "Why does Gateway Reconciliation fail with \"SettlementDateConflict\" errors for Adyen chargebacks?", "response": "The \"SettlementDateConflict\" error occurs when the gateway sends a \"Settlement\" event with a timestamp later than the \"Chargeback\" event for the same transaction. Zuora requires the original transaction to be settled before a chargeback can be applied. If the chronological order of events from the gateway is incorrect (Settlement date > Chargeback date), the reconciliation job rejects the chargeback. However, if the transaction was eventually settled successfully in a previous event, this error may be benign. Resolving the data inconsistency often requires a data fix or re-processing once the settlement event is recorded.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Gateway Reconciliation settlement date conflict"}
{"instruction": "Why do Booking and Billing Variance reports show discrepancies for Bundle lines in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "Variance discrepancies for Bundle lines (showing as \"Amount Mismatch\" or missing transactions) can be caused by a known defect (e.g., UNO-4599) where bundle lines are not correctly reconciled. This issue is resolved in patch releases (e.g., 2025.Q4.1.1). To fix existing variances after the patch is applied, the stale variance records must be manually deleted from the reconciliation tables (`rpro_uno_recon_booking_dtl_g` and `rpro_uno_recon_billing_dtl_g`) so that the next reconciliation job can re-assess and clear them.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Revenue reconciliation bundle variance"}
{"instruction": "What does the error \"java.io.IOException: Stream Closed\" mean during a Salesforce Sync?", "response": "This error typically indicates a generic failure or interruption in the sync process, often caused by a race condition if a manual sync is triggered while a scheduled sync is already in progress (or vice versa). If the sync gets stuck in this state, the sync state may need to be reset from the backend. Ensure no other syncs are running before triggering a manual attempt.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Salesforce sync stream closed error"}
{"instruction": "Why do Journal Runs show a blank Credit Accounting Code for Taxation Items even after updating the configuration?", "response": "Updating the accounting code configuration does not automatically backfill or update existing `TaxationItem` records that have already been generated. If a Journal Run picks up these existing records, they will still have blank codes. To resolve this, you must use the Mass Updater tool to update the Accounting Code directly on the `TaxationItem` object for the affected records. Afterward, cancel the incorrect Journal Run and execute a new one to pick up the corrected data.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Journal Run blank accounting codes"}
{"instruction": "Why is a GL Connector Summary run stuck in \"Queued\" status for a long time?", "response": "A GL Connector run stays \"Queued\" if the initial request was enqueued but failed to be picked up by the worker, often due to hitting concurrent API limits at the time of submission. There is no self-service way to delete these stuck jobs in the UI. The solution is to simply ignore the stuck job and run a new GL Connector job. The connector is designed to pick up only untransferred journals, so re-running it is safe and will not result in double-posting.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "GL Connector stuck job"}
{"instruction": "How do I resolve Zuora Revenue discrepancies where Sales Order lines are stuck with error RPRO-00647 or RPRO-00648?", "response": "These errors indicate a version mismatch or processing gap between Billing and Revenue. \n- **RPRO-00647 (Previously processed):** Check if the Revenue Contract (RC) was on hold. If so, remove the hold and run Data Collection.\n- **RPRO-00648 (Charge version not existed):** This often happens if a subscription was cancelled or amended but the intermediate version wasn't fully processed.

{"instruction": "Why does a Bill Run take an excessively long time (e.g., 14+ hours) for a relatively small number of accounts?", "response": "Bill run performance is driven by data density, not just account count. A bill run may take hours for only a few thousand accounts if the resulting invoices contain an extreme number of line items (e.g., thousands of usage charges or complex transaction fees per invoice). High-density invoices require significantly more processing power and time to rate and generate than standard subscription invoices.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Bill run performance"}
{"instruction": "Why does the Workflow \"Iterate\" task process records in parallel when \"For-Each\" is selected?", "response": "The \"For-Each\" option in a Workflow Iterate task is designed to process records concurrently (in parallel) to maximize throughput, based on the workflow's concurrency limits. It does not process records sequentially (one at a time) and does not wait for one iteration to finish before starting the next. This is the expected behavior for this task type.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Workflow iterate task concurrency"}
{"instruction": "Why is the MSQ (Multi-Subscription Quote) preview stuck in \"Processing\" status?", "response": "The MSQ preview may get stuck if the Zuora Quotes installed package version is outdated.

{"instruction": "How can I enable Orders Harmonization in my tenant?", "response": "Orders Harmonization can typically be enabled via self-service in the Zuora UI under **Settings > Billing > Manage Features**. However, for the option to appear, the \"Orders\" feature must already be enabled in the tenant.

{"instruction": "What should I do if a Revenue Contract (RC) is locked/frozen and I cannot perform delinking/relinking?", "response": "A Revenue Contract becomes locked/frozen when a background process, such as Data Collection, is actively running on the system. The recommended action is to wait for the Data Collection job to complete, which will automatically release the lock. If the lock persists or you need to force an update, you can use the **Manage Mass Actions** functionality in the Revenue Workbench to manually Unfreeze the RC, but caution is advised if a job is running.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Revenue Contract locked"}
{"instruction": "How do I refresh a Revenue Sandbox from Production?", "response": "Zuora Revenue provides a self-service \"Refresh Sandbox\" option within the Revenue UI (usually under Console or System settings).
