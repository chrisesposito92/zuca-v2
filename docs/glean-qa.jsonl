{"instruction": "What is the recommended API for managing the entire subscription lifecycle (create, amend, renew, cancel) in Zuora?", "response": "The Orders API is the recommended unified interface for all subscription lifecycle operations. Unlike the legacy Subscribe and Amend APIs, the Orders API supports complex, multi-step changes (e.g., adding a product and extending the term simultaneously) in a single transaction and is required for newer features like Order Metrics and Prepaid with Drawdown.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Subscription lifecycle (create, amend, renew, cancel, suspend)"}
{"instruction": "How do I permanently terminate a subscription in Zuora using the Orders API?", "response": "To permanently terminate a subscription, use the 'CancelSubscription' order action within a POST /v1/orders call.

{"instruction": "What is the recommended SQL join pattern when querying Rate Plan Charges in Zuora Data Query to ensure performance?", "response": "When writing Data Query SQL, follow the 'trunk' model by joining from the parent object down to the child object to avoid fan-out issues. The recommended join path is `Account` -> `Subscription` -> `Rate Plan` -> `Rate Plan Charge`. Always filter on indexed fields like `Account.Id` or `Subscription.Status` and avoid using `SELECT *`.

{"instruction": "What steps are required to assign a specific Invoice Owner to a Rate Plan Charge?", "response": "To bill a specific charge to a different entity than the subscription owner, you must enable the 'Invoice Owner at Rate Plan Charge Level' feature. Once enabled, navigate to the Rate Plan Charge details on the subscription (or use the API) and populate the `InvoiceOwnerId` field with the account ID of the intended payer.

{"instruction": "What are the primary configuration options available in Zuora Billing for handling proration of recurring charges?", "response": "Zuora Billing provides three main settings to control proration for recurring charges: 1) 'Prorate recurring charges for partial period?' which enables or disables proration entirely; 2) 'When prorating periods greater than a month, prorate by month first, or by day?' which determines if the system calculates based on full months plus remaining days or purely on total days; and 3) 'When prorating a month, assume 30 days in a month or use actual days?' which dictates whether the daily rate is derived from a standard 30-day month or the actual calendar days in the specific month.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Proration settings and calculations"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora calculate the prorated amount if the 'Prorate by day' option is selected for a billing period?", "response": "When 'Prorate by day' is selected, Zuora calculates the prorated amount by taking the total amount of the charge for the full billing period, dividing it by the total number of actual days in that billing period to get a daily rate, and then multiplying this daily rate by the number of days the subscription was active during that period.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Proration settings and calculations"}
{"instruction": "Explain the calculation logic when 'Prorate by month first, then by day' is configured for a subscription spanning multiple months and a partial month.", "response": "With this setting, Zuora first calculates the charge for the number of full months included in the period.

This standardizes calculations but can lead to slight variances compared to actual calendar days.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Proration settings and calculations"}
{"instruction": "How can I configure proration settings for a specific product charge that differs from the tenant-level default?", "response": "You can override tenant-level proration settings at the specific charge level by navigating to the Product Catalog, selecting the Rate Plan Charge, and editing the 'Proration Option'. You can choose 'Prorate by Day', 'Prorate by Month', or 'Charge Full Period' specifically for that charge, which will take precedence over the global billing rules.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Proration settings and calculations"}
{"instruction": "Why might a Credit Memo be generated for the full billing period amount instead of a prorated amount after a mid-term cancellation?", "response": "This often occurs if the billing rule 'When bill credit for recurring charges, based on billed period or credit period' is set to 'Based on the total billing period amount'.

If you attempt to edit a pending ad-hoc bill run that was created under a different timezone context (or if the tenant timezone has changed), you may receive an error. The resolution is to cancel the pending run and recreate it with the correct current parameters.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Bill runs (scheduled vs ad-hoc)"}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to filter a scheduled bill run dynamically by 'Bill Run Date' using Advanced Filters?", "response": "Currently, Advanced Filters for bill runs do not natively support a dynamic 'Bill Run Date' variable (like `{{BillRunDate}}`) for scheduled runs in the same way they support `{{TargetDate}}` or `{{InvoiceDate}}`. This is a known limitation, often requiring workarounds like manual ad-hoc runs or external API triggers if precise date matching against the execution day is required.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Bill runs (scheduled vs ad-hoc)"}
{"instruction": "How do I trigger an immediate execution of a scheduled bill run that is currently paused?", "response": "If a scheduled bill run is paused, you can navigate to the bill run schedule in the UI and choose to run it immediately as a one-time job. This effectively creates an ad-hoc execution based on the schedule's criteria without resuming the recurring schedule itself if you wish to keep it paused.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Bill runs (scheduled vs ad-hoc)"}
{"instruction": "Which bill run type allows me to select specific 'Rate Plan Charges' to exclude?", "response": "Both scheduled and ad-hoc bill runs allow for filtering, but ad-hoc bill runs provide the most flexibility for one-off exclusions. You can use Advanced Filters in an ad-hoc bill run to specifically include or exclude certain Rate Plan Charges, Subscriptions, or Accounts for that single execution.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Bill runs (scheduled vs ad-hoc)"}
{"instruction": "How do I create a new Bill Run in Zuora to generate invoices for my customers?", "response": "Navigate to Billing > Invoices > Bill Runs and click 'Create Bill Run'. Enter a descriptive name, select the Bill Cycle (e.g., Monthly), and define the Bill Cycle Day. Set the 'Invoice Date' (the date displayed on the invoice) and 'Target Date' (the cutoff date for charges to be included). Finally, select the accounts to include using filters like Account Status or Batch, then click 'Generate Bill Run'.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended approach for fixing slow Invoice PDF generation times?", "response": "The most effective long-term solution is to switch from Microsoft Word (.docx) templates to HTML invoice templates. HTML templates offer significantly better performance, auto-scaling capabilities, and faster rendering, especially for invoices with large usage data volumes. If switching is not immediate, you can try optimizing your Word template by removing complex conditional logic or reducing the number of line items per invoice.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "Why is the 'pdfFileUrl' field blank when I retrieve an invoice via the REST API?", "response": "The 'pdfFileUrl' field is often blank because the PDF generation process is asynchronous and may not have completed yet, or the necessary notification trigger is disabled. To ensure the PDF URL is populated, go to Settings > Z-Billing Settings > Setup Profiles, Notifications, and Email Templates and ensure the 'Invoice Posted | Invoice Posted via API' notification is enabled. This notification triggers the system to finalize the PDF generation step.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "How can I include images, such as a company logo, in an HTML invoice template?", "response": "Unlike Word templates, HTML templates in Zuora do not have a built-in asset library to store images. You must either host the image on a publicly accessible external server and reference it via a standard <img> tag URL, or embed the image directly into the HTML code as a base64-encoded data URI (recommended for small images like logos to ensure they render without external dependencies).", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "Can I generate an invoice for a specific single subscription using the API?", "response": "Yes, you can generate an invoice for a single subscription by using the 'Create Bill Run' REST API endpoint (POST /v1/bill-runs). In the request body, define the 'billRunFilters' array and set the 'filterType' to 'Subscription' and provide the specific 'subscriptionId'. This restricts the bill run to process only that specific subscription.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "What should I check if a Bill Run completes but fails to include a specific subscription's charges?", "response": "First, verify the 'Target Date' of the Bill Run; it must be on or after the service start date of the charges you expect to bill. Second, check that the subscription is 'Active' and not in 'Draft' or 'Expired' status. Third, ensure the subscription has a valid Rate Plan Charge that is ready to be billed (e.g., trigger conditions are met) and that the account's Bill Cycle Day matches the Bill Run settings.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between 'Invoice Date' and 'Target Date' in a Bill Run?", "response": "The 'Invoice Date' is the date that actually appears on the generated invoice document and is used for payment terms (e.g., Net 30 starts from this date). The 'Target Date' is a control parameter that determines which charges are picked up; the Bill Run will include all unbilled charges with a service start date up to and including this Target Date.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "How do I regenerate an invoice PDF if the original contained an error?", "response": "You can regenerate an invoice PDF using the Zuora REST API 'update' call on the Invoice object. While you cannot trigger a regeneration purely from the standard UI for a posted invoice, making a specific API update (often to a custom field or by toggling the 'RegenerateInvoicePDF' flag if available in your specific configuration) triggers the system to re-render the PDF document using the current template.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "Why are my Credit Memo PDFs failing to generate even though my Invoice PDFs work fine?", "response": "This often happens if you are using an Invoice template for your Credit Memos. Credit Memos require their own specific templates that use Credit Memo merge fields (e.g., CreditMemo.Amount) rather than Invoice merge fields (e.g., Invoice.Total). Ensure you have uploaded a dedicated template for Credit Memos in Settings > Billing > Manage Billing Document Configuration.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "What is the best practice for sending invoice emails to customers automatically?", "response": "Configure your 'Invoice Posted' notification event to handle email delivery rather than using a manual or custom trigger. This is best practice because the 'Invoice Posted' event fires only after the invoice has been successfully posted and the PDF generation is complete, preventing scenarios where customers receive emails with broken links or missing attachments.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "How do I resolve a 'Timeout' error when generating a PDF for a large invoice?", "response": "Timeout errors typically occur when an invoice exceeds the processing limits, such as having thousands of line items or a massive Usage Summary. To resolve this, switch to an HTML template (which handles large datasets better), disable the detailed Usage Summary section in your template, or configure your aggregation rules to summarize charges into fewer line items before billing.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "Where can I find and download the generated PDF for a specific invoice in the UI?", "response": "Navigate to the specific customer account page, scroll down to the 'Transactions' or 'Invoices' section, and click on the Invoice Number.

{"instruction": "What is the main functional difference between Word and HTML invoice templates in Zuora?", "response": "Word templates are file-based (.docx), easier for business users to edit visually, and support embedded static images, but are slower and processed in a shared queue. HTML templates are code-based, offer superior performance and scalability for high volumes, support advanced logic via Liquid expressions, and are recommended for complex or large invoices.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "How do I configure a custom invoice template to be used for a specific customer account?", "response": "First, create and upload your new template in Settings > Billing > Manage Billing Document Configuration.

Future invoices for this account will now use this specific template instead of the system default.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice generation and templates"}
{"instruction": "What is the relationship between an Invoice Item and a Taxation Item in Zuora's object model?", "response": "In Zuora's data model, a Taxation Item is a child object of an Invoice Item. Each Invoice Item (which represents a charge on the invoice) can have multiple associated Taxation Items, representing different tax components (e.g., state tax, city tax, county tax). The Taxation Item stores specific details such as the Tax Amount, Tax Rate, Jurisdiction, and Tax Code for that specific portion of the tax. You can retrieve these by querying the TaxationItem object and filtering by the InvoiceItemId.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "How can I issue a credit for only the tax amount on a posted invoice without crediting the charge amount?", "response": "To credit only the tax amount, you must create a Credit Memo. In the Credit Memo creation UI, select the invoice you wish to credit. For the specific Invoice Item, set the credit amount for the charge itself to 0. Then, expand the item to view the associated taxation items and enter the specific amount you wish to credit in the tax amount fields. Post the Credit Memo to apply the tax-only credit.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "I am receiving the error 'Tax items of memo do not match that of the associated invoice item' when creating a Credit Memo. How do I resolve this?", "response": "This error occurs when the system cannot exact-match the tax lines on the Credit Memo with the tax lines on the original Invoice, often due to differences in tax engine responses or rounding. To resolve this, enable the billing rule 'Allow indistinct mapping from Memo / Invoice Item Adjustment tax item to invoice item tax'. Go to Settings > Billing > Define Billing Rules and set this rule to 'Yes'. This allows Zuora to map tax items even if they don't match distinct keys like Location Code or Jurisdiction exactly.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "Why are the manual taxation items I created via API deleted when I post the invoice?", "response": "When an invoice is posted, Zuora triggers the configured tax engine (such as Zuora Tax, Avalara, or Vertex) to calculate taxes for the invoice to ensure compliance and accuracy. This system-triggered calculation often overwrites any manually created taxation items added while the invoice was in Draft status. To retain manual tax items, you typically must ensure the invoice is not set to auto-calculate tax upon posting, or use a tax solution that supports/preserves external tax data.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "What does the 'Allow indistinct mapping from Memo / Invoice Item Adjustment tax item to invoice item tax' setting do?", "response": "This setting controls how Zuora maps taxation items from a Credit/Debit Memo or Invoice Item Adjustment back to the original Invoice's taxation items. By default (No), Zuora uses 'distinct mapping,' requiring an exact match of fields like LocationCode, Jurisdiction, and TaxRate. Setting this to 'Yes' enables 'indistinct mapping,' allowing the system to associate tax items based on broader matching logic, which prevents errors when the tax engine returns slightly different tax line structures for the memo than it did for the original invoice.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "How do I troubleshoot the error 'The source invoice does not use this tax engine' when creating an Invoice Item Adjustment?", "response": "This error appears when you attempt to adjust an invoice that was originally processed with a different tax engine than the one currently active or configured for the adjustment. To bypass this validation strictness and allow the adjustment to proceed, you should enable the billing rule 'Allow indistinct mapping from Memo / Invoice Item Adjustment tax item to invoice item tax' in your Billing Settings. This loosens the mapping requirements and allows the adjustment to map tax items across different engine contexts.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "Where does Zuora derive the Tax Code from when generating an Invoice Item?", "response": "During invoice generation, Zuora looks at the Subscription Rate Plan Charge associated with the item. If a Tax Code is defined at the Subscription Rate Plan Charge level, it takes precedence. If not, Zuora falls back to the Tax Code defined on the Product Rate Plan Charge in the Product Catalog. This Tax Code is then used by the tax engine to determine the appropriate tax rules and rates.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "How can I update the Accounting Code for a specific Taxation Item?", "response": "You can update the Accounting Code for a Taxation Item using the Zuora API (e.g., PUT /v1/object/taxation-item/{id}) or by using the Mass Updater tool in the UI. In the Mass Updater, select the Taxation Item object, upload a CSV file containing the Taxation Item IDs and the new Accounting Codes, and run the update. Note that you generally cannot update accounting codes on invoices that are already posted and have their accounting entries transferred to the GL.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "I have discounted invoice items, but I cannot see the taxation amount specifically for the discount in the export. Why?", "response": "In Zuora, discounts are often applied to the charge amount to determine a net taxable amount, or handled as negative invoice items depending on configuration. If the discount is not a separate line item but a direct discount on the charge, the Taxation Item associated with the Charge Invoice Item reflects the tax on the final (net) amount. There is often no separate 'Taxation Item' specifically for the discount portion unless the discount is modeled as a separate negative charge that is itself taxable.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "What is the system limitation for reversing an invoice regarding the number of items?", "response": "Zuora has a limitation where you cannot reverse an invoice if the total number of Invoice Items and Taxation Items combined exceeds 2,000. If you attempt to reverse an invoice with more than 2,000 combined items, the system will return a threshold limit error. In such cases, you must use Credit Memos to credit out the balance instead of using the Reverse Invoice function.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "How do I configure Zuora to use Avalara for calculating taxes on Invoice Item Adjustments?", "response": "To use Avalara for Invoice Item Adjustments, navigate to Settings > Billing > Define Billing Rules. Locate the rule 'Use Avalara to calculate taxes for invoice item adjustments' and set it to 'Yes'. When enabled, Zuora will send the adjustment data to Avalara to calculate the tax credit amount dynamically rather than just prorating the original tax.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "Why is the tax amount on my Credit Memo slightly different from the tax on the original Invoice for the same amount?", "response": "This is often due to rounding differences. The original invoice tax was calculated on the specific invoice items at that time. When a Credit Memo is created, the tax is recalculated based on the credit amount. If the tax engine (like Avalara or Z-Tax) rounds differently for the credit transaction or if the credit covers a partial amount that causes a rounding variance compared to the original pro-ration, you may see penny differences. Enabling 'indistinct mapping' can helps map these items even if amounts slightly differ, but the calculation itself depends on the tax engine's logic for credits.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "Can I use the 'Create taxation items' API to add tax to a posted invoice?", "response": "No, you generally cannot add taxation items to an invoice that is already in 'Posted' status. The 'Create taxation items' API is intended for use with Draft invoices. Once an invoice is Posted, the tax data is considered final for accounting purposes. If you need to correct tax on a posted invoice, you should issue a Debit Memo (to add tax) or a Credit Memo (to reverse tax), or cancel and recreate the invoice.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice items and taxation"}
{"instruction": "What is the primary functional difference between a Credit Memo and a Debit Memo in Zuora's Invoice Settlement model?", "response": "In Zuora's Invoice Settlement model, a Credit Memo is a billing document that reduces the amount a customer owes (effectively a negative balance applied against an invoice or account), whereas a Debit Memo increases the amount a customer owes (similar to a standalone invoice but often used for ad-hoc charges or adjustments). Credit Memos are typically used to correct overcharges or process returns, while Debit Memos are often used to correct undercharges or apply fees like late payment penalties.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "I am receiving the error 'Tax items of memo do not match that of the associated invoice item' when creating a Credit Memo. How can I resolve this?", "response": "This error occurs when Zuora's validation logic cannot strictly match the tax lines on the Credit Memo to those on the original Invoice, often due to slight differences in tax engine responses or rounding. To resolve this, navigate to Billing Settings > Define Billing Rules and enable the setting 'Allow indistinct mapping from Memo / Invoice Item Adjustment tax item to invoice item tax'. This relaxes the matching criteria, allowing the system to map tax items even if fields like Location Code or Jurisdiction do not match exactly.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "How do I handle a scenario where I need to unapply a Credit Memo that has more than 1,000 items, and the UI is timing out?", "response": "Zuora's UI has a limitation for unapplying Credit Memos with a large number of items (typically over 1,000). In this scenario, you must use the Zuora REST API to perform the unapply action. Specifically, you can use the 'Unapply a credit memo' operation (PUT /v1/creditmemos/{creditMemoId}/unapply). For extremely large transactions, you may need to check if the Asynchronous Unapply feature is enabled for your tenant to prevent timeouts.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended best practice for correcting a billing error where a customer was overcharged, instead of using a negative invoice?", "response": "Under Invoice Settlement, the best practice is to issue a Credit Memo rather than creating a negative invoice. Negative invoices are a legacy concept that does not align with the Invoice Settlement data model. You should create a Credit Memo for the overcharged amount (either at the invoice level or line-item level) and then apply that Credit Memo to the original invoice to reduce its balance, or refund the Credit Memo balance to the customer if the invoice was already paid.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "How can I configure Zuora to automatically generate a Debit Memo for credit card surcharges?", "response": "You can configure Zuora to automatically assess credit card surcharges which are generated as Debit Memos. This is done through the Surcharge configuration in your Payments settings. When a payment is processed via a credit card that matches your surcharge logic (e.g., specific card type or region), Zuora will automatically create a Posted Debit Memo for the surcharge amount. Note that these surcharge Debit Memos are not linked to a specific invoice item but are standalone documents on the account.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "I am trying to use the 'Write off a debit memo' API but receiving a 'You are not authorized for this operation' error. What permission is missing?", "response": "This error indicates that the user or API client attempting the write-off does not have the 'Enhanced Write-off' permission enabled. This is a specific permission that must be toggled on by your company administrator or by Zuora Global Support for your tenant.

{"instruction": "Explain the concept of 'Indistinct Mapping' regarding Credit Memo taxation items.", "response": "Indistinct Mapping is a fallback mechanism in Zuora's billing rules. By default, Zuora attempts 'distinct mapping,' which tries to match a Credit Memo's taxation item to an Invoice's taxation item by looking for an exact match on fields like Tax Rate, Jurisdiction, and Location Code. If the tax engine returns slightly different data for the credit (e.g., a different location code format), distinct mapping fails. Enabling Indistinct Mapping allows Zuora to associate the tax items based on a looser set of criteria, preventing the creation process from failing due to minor data discrepancies.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "How do I credit only the tax amount on a specific invoice item without crediting the main charge?", "response": "To create a tax-only credit, navigate to the Invoice and select 'Create Credit Memo'. In the creation screen, set the credit amount for the Invoice Item charge to 0. Then, expand the item to view its taxation items and enter the specific amount you wish to credit in the tax field. This creates a Credit Memo that only affects the tax balance, which is useful for correcting tax exemption status issues after an invoice has been posted.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "Why does my Credit Memo not automatically apply to a future-dated invoice even though 'Auto-Apply' is enabled?", "response": "Zuora's Auto-Apply logic for Credit Memos generally targets the oldest open invoice or debit memo on the account first to settle outstanding debt. If you generate a Credit Memo intended for a future-dated invoice (e.g., next year's subscription), the system will not automatically skip older open invoices to apply it to the future one unless the Credit Memo was created specifically from that future invoice's line items. If it's a standalone or unapplied credit, it defaults to the standard accounting logic of clearing the oldest debt first.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "What are the steps to refund a Credit Memo balance to a customer?", "response": "To refund a Credit Memo, first ensure the Credit Memo is in 'Posted' status and has an unapplied positive balance. Navigate to the Credit Memo detail page, click the 'More' dropdown, and select 'Refund'. In the refund dialog, select the payment method (usually the electronic payment method used for the original payment) and specify the refund amount. This action creates a Refund object in Zuora that is linked to the Credit Memo, reducing its unapplied balance.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "Can I use the API to apply a Credit Memo to an Invoice line item that has a tax component?", "response": "Yes, you can apply a Credit Memo to an invoice at the transaction line item level via the API. When doing so for items with tax, you must construct your API payload to specify both the `invoiceItemId` for the charge and the specific `taxationItemId` if you are applying credit to the tax portion. If you only specify the invoice item amount without breaking down the tax application, Zuora may attempt to prorate the application, but explicit item-level application is more precise for partial credits.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "What should I check if I get a 'Missing required value' error for a custom field when creating a refund from a Credit Memo?", "response": "This error usually indicates that there is a custom field on the Refund object that has been configured as 'Required' in your tenant settings, but the specific UI screen or API flow you are using to create the refund from the Credit Memo does not provide an input for that field. To fix this, you must either make the custom field optional in the settings or ensure your API call/custom integration includes a value for that mandatory field.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to reverse a Credit Memo that has already been posted?", "response": "Once a Credit Memo is posted, it cannot be un-posted or deleted. To 'reverse' the financial effect of a posted Credit Memo, you typically have two options: if the Credit Memo has not been applied, you can apply it to a Debit Memo (creating a new Debit Memo if necessary) to net it out. If it was applied to an invoice incorrectly, you can 'Unapply' it to open the invoice balance back up, and then apply it elsewhere or leave it on account. There is no direct 'Reverse Credit Memo' button that simply voids the document.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "How do I bulk import Credit Memos to correct a billing error affecting multiple accounts?", "response": "To bulk import Credit Memos, you should use the 'Mass Updater' tool or the 'Credit Memo Import' feature if available, but often the most robust method for complex corrections is using the 'Create credit memo' API in a script or using the Developer Tools (if available in your tenant) to upload a CSV that maps to the Credit Memo API fields. You will need to prepare a file containing the Invoice ID, Account ID, and the specific amounts to credit for each line item.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "When should I use a Debit Memo instead of a new Invoice?", "response": "You should use a Debit Memo when you need to increase the balance owed by a customer on an existing account, particularly for non-subscription charges or adjustments that are not part of the regular recurring billing cycle. Examples include ad-hoc fees, late payment penalties, or correcting an undercharge on a previous period without generating a full subscription invoice. Debit Memos act as separate receivable documents that can be paid or netted against Credit Memos.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Credit memos and debit memos"}
{"instruction": "What is Invoice Settlement in Zuora and how does it differ from the legacy model?", "response": "Invoice Settlement is a feature that aligns Zuora with standard accounting practices by introducing Credit Memos and Debit Memos as separate billing documents. It replaces the legacy 'Invoice Adjustments' and 'Invoice Item Adjustments' model. Under Invoice Settlement, Credit Memos reduce the amount a customer owes, and Debit Memos increase it. This allows for more flexible application of payments and credits, including partial applications and unapplying transactions, providing better GL alignment and traceability compared to the legacy model which only allowed direct adjustments to invoice balances.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Invoice settlement"}
{"instruction": "What are the primary objects introduced with Invoice Settlement?", "response": "The primary objects introduced with Invoice Settlement are `CreditMemo`, `DebitMemo`, `CreditMemoApplication`, and `PaymentApplication`. `CreditMemo` represents a credit issued to a customer, `DebitMemo` represents an additional charge, `CreditMemoApplication` links a Credit Memo to an Invoice or Debit Memo to reduce its balance, and `PaymentApplication` links a Payment to an Invoice or Debit Memo.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Invoice settlement"}
{"instruction": "How do I migrate my tenant to Invoice Settlement?", "response": "Migrating to Invoice Settlement involves a specific enablement process. You must first review the Invoice Settlement migration checklist and guide. The process typically requires submitting a request to Zuora Global Support to assess feature compatibility and perform the migration. There is also a 'Harmonization' phase available for some tenants to ease the transition.

{"instruction": "How do I unapply a payment from an invoice in Invoice Settlement?", "response": "In Invoice Settlement, you unapply a payment by using the UI 'Unapply' option on the payment record or via the API using the `PUT /v1/payments/{paymentId}/unapply` operation. You can specify the amount to unapply from specific invoices or debit memos. Note that unapplying may be restricted if the transaction is in a closed accounting period.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice settlement"}
{"instruction": "Which API operations should I use for billing documents with Invoice Settlement enabled?", "response": "With Invoice Settlement enabled, you should use the REST API operations for `Credit Memos` (/v1/creditmemos), `Debit Memos` (/v1/debitmemos), and `Payments` (/v1/object/payment-application). You should avoid using the legacy `Invoice Adjustments` and `Invoice Item Adjustments` SOAP or REST operations, as these are deprecated for IS-enabled tenants.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Invoice settlement"}
{"instruction": "How do I write off a bad debt invoice using Invoice Settlement?", "response": "To write off an invoice, you create a Credit Memo for the outstanding balance amount. You typically assign a specific reason code (e.g., 'Write-off') to the Credit Memo for reporting purposes. Then, apply this Credit Memo to the invoice to reduce its balance to zero.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice settlement"}
{"instruction": "Why am I getting a 'Payment amount exceeds balance' error when applying a payment?", "response": "This error occurs in Invoice Settlement when the amount you are trying to apply to an invoice is greater than its remaining open balance.

{"instruction": "What happens if a customer overpays an invoice in Invoice Settlement?", "response": "If a customer overpays, you can process the full payment amount. The portion covering the invoice balance is applied to the invoice, and the excess amount creates an 'Unapplied Payment' balance on the payment record. This unapplied amount sits on the account and can be applied to future invoices or refunded to the customer.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice settlement"}
{"instruction": "What is a negative invoice in Zuora?", "response": "In the legacy Zuora billing model, a negative invoice is a billing document where the total amount is negative, typically resulting from credits, discounts, or prorated charges that exceed positive charges. These were often used to represent a credit owed to the customer. However, under the newer Invoice Settlement model, negative invoices are generally not supported or are replaced by Credit Memos.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Negative invoice handling"}
{"instruction": "How are negative invoices handled when enabling Invoice Settlement?", "response": "During the migration to Invoice Settlement, existing negative invoices with an open balance are typically converted into Credit Memos. The migration process involves first writing off the negative invoice using an Invoice Item Adjustment (IIA) to bring its balance to zero, and then simultaneously creating a Credit Memo for the same amount to represent the credit. This ensures the financial impact is preserved in the new data model.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Negative invoice handling"}
{"instruction": "I have Invoice Settlement enabled and I'm getting an error 'Negative invoice cannot be posted'. What should I do?", "response": "If Invoice Settlement is enabled, Zuora prevents the posting of invoices with a negative total balance because credits should be handled via Credit Memos. You should review the bill run or invoice generation logic. Instead of creating a negative invoice, you should likely be generating a Credit Memo.

{"instruction": "Can I revert a converted Credit Memo back to a Negative Invoice after migrating to Invoice Settlement?", "response": "No, the migration to Invoice Settlement is a one-way process. Once a negative invoice has been converted to a Credit Memo during the migration, it cannot be reverted back to a negative invoice. The system no longer supports negative invoices for transaction processing once Invoice Settlement is enabled.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Negative invoice handling"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'Invoice Settlement Harmonization' behavior regarding negative invoices?", "response": "Invoice Settlement Harmonization allows for a transitional state where legacy objects (like Invoice Adjustments) and new objects (like Credit Memos) coexist. However, there is a specific setting 'Enable credit memo generation instead of negative invoices'. If this is enabled, the system will start generating Credit Memos for negative bill run totals instead of negative invoices. If not enabled, legacy behavior might persist until full Invoice Settlement is adopted.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Negative invoice handling"}
{"instruction": "I see both a negative Invoice AND a negative Credit Memo generated for the same transaction. What could cause this?", "response": "This is an abnormal edge case, potentially related to specific tax calculation timing issues (e.g., with external tax engines like Avalara) where the system decides to create a Credit Memo based on a preview, but the final tax calculation results in a different sign or amount due to rounding or thresholds (like E911 caps), causing the system to also attempt to create an invoice. This scenario typically requires a support ticket to investigate root cause, as it indicates a divergence between tax preview and commit.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Negative invoice handling"}
{"instruction": "How do I write off a negative invoice that exists from before Invoice Settlement enablement?", "response": "If you have legacy negative invoices that need to be cleared before or during migration, you typically 'transfer to credit balance' in the legacy model. However, during the Invoice Settlement migration process itself, Zuora automates this by internally creating an Invoice Item Adjustment to zero out the invoice and creating a corresponding Credit Memo. You generally do not need to manually write them off if you are following the standard migration path, unless you want to clean up data beforehand.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Negative invoice handling"}
{"instruction": "What billing rule controls whether a Credit Memo is created for negative amounts?", "response": "The billing rule is typically named 'Invoice/Credit Memo generation rule'. To handle negative amounts correctly under Invoice Settlement, this should be set to 'Create credit memos for net negative invoice totals' or 'Create credit memos for net negative invoice totals without grouping charges'. This ensures that if a bill run results in a negative total for an account, a Credit Memo is generated instead of a negative invoice.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Negative invoice handling"}
{"instruction": "Why is my 'Invoice/Credit Memo generation rule' setting important for tax calculation?", "response": "The setting determines whether negative charges are grouped into a Credit Memo or kept on an invoice. This affects tax calculation because tax engines often handle positive and negative lines differently. If negative lines are grouped into a Credit Memo, the tax engine calculates tax on the Credit Memo separately. If they are kept on a mixed invoice (if allowed), the tax engine calculates net tax. Incorrect settings can lead to tax discrepancies or generation failures.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Negative invoice handling"}
{"instruction": "How can I prevent negative invoices from being generated in a legacy tenant?", "response": "In a legacy tenant (without Invoice Settlement), negative invoices were the standard way to handle net credits from a bill run. You generally cannot 'prevent' them if the charges sum to a negative amount, unless you defer the negative charges or use the 'Credit Balance' feature to hold the credit. To stop using negative invoices entirely, you must migrate to Invoice Settlement.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Negative invoice handling"}
{"instruction": "What is the key difference between 'Invoice Adjustment' and 'Invoice Item Adjustment' in the legacy Zuora model?", "response": "In the legacy model, an 'Invoice Adjustment' modifies the balance of an invoice at the header level without being tied to specific line items. It was primarily used to correct the overall invoice amount. An 'Invoice Item Adjustment' (IIA), on the other hand, allows you to adjust the balance of specific invoice line items (charges). IIAs provide more granular control and better reporting, especially for tax purposes, as they can be linked to specific taxable items. Note that both features are deprecated in tenants with Invoice Settlement enabled, where they are replaced by Credit/Debit Memos.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Invoice adjustments"}
{"instruction": "I am trying to use the API to create an 'Invoice Adjustment' but getting an 'Unknown object type' error. Why?", "response": "This error occurs because the 'Invoice Adjustment' object is a deprecated legacy object that may not be exposed or supported in your tenant, especially if you have Invoice Settlement enabled or are using a newer API version that defaults to Invoice Item Adjustments or Credit Memos. If you are on Invoice Settlement, you must use Credit Memos instead. If you are on the legacy model, ensure you are using the correct SOAP or REST endpoint for 'Invoice Adjustment' and that your user permissions allow access to it.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice adjustments"}
{"instruction": "Can I use Invoice Item Adjustments to write off a negative invoice?", "response": "Yes, in the legacy model, Invoice Item Adjustments (IIA) are the standard way to 'write off' or clear the balance of a negative invoice. You would create a charge (positive) adjustment to net out the negative balance to zero. In fact, during the migration to Invoice Settlement, Zuora automatically uses IIAs to zero out negative invoices before converting them to Credit Memos.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice adjustments"}
{"instruction": "How do I perform a mass update of Invoice Item Adjustments?", "response": "To perform a mass update or creation of Invoice Item Adjustments, you can use the 'Mass Updater' tool in the Zuora UI (if enabled) or, more commonly, the 'Developer Tools' (specifically the Generic API Loader) to upload a CSV file. The CSV should contain the necessary fields like InvoiceId, Amount, Type (Credit/Charge), and AdjustmentDate. Note that standard API endpoints for bulk updates might be limited, so the API Loader is the recommended path for bulk legacy operations.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice adjustments"}
{"instruction": "Will Invoice Item Adjustments continue to be supported for legacy tenants?", "response": "Zuora has indicated that while Invoice Item Adjustments are 'deprecated' in favor of Invoice Settlement, they are currently in 'Maintenance Mode' with no hard End-of-Life (EOL) date set for tenants that have not yet migrated. You can continue to use them if you are on the legacy model, but no new features will be added, and you are strongly encouraged to migrate to Invoice Settlement for long-term support and compliance.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Invoice adjustments"}
{"instruction": "Why did my Invoice Item Adjustment fail with 'Adjustment cannot be created for invoice with a zero balance'?", "response": "This error means you are trying to create a credit adjustment (to reduce the balance) on an invoice that is already fully paid or settled (balance is 0). You cannot reduce the balance below zero using an adjustment. If you need to refund the customer, you should issue a refund against the payment. If you need to correct the invoice for accounting purposes without a refund, you might need to cancel/reverse the invoice or use a Credit Memo (if on Invoice Settlement).", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice adjustments"}
{"instruction": "What happens to my historical Invoice Adjustments when I migrate to Invoice Settlement?", "response": "During the migration to Invoice Settlement, historical Invoice Adjustments and Invoice Item Adjustments are typically preserved as read-only legacy records for reporting purposes. They are not 'converted' into Credit Memos; rather, they remain linked to the invoices they adjusted. However, any *open* negative balances that would have been handled by adjustments are converted to Credit Memos. Going forward, you will use Credit Memos for all new adjustments.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Invoice adjustments"}
{"instruction": "How do I correct a tax calculation error on a posted invoice using legacy adjustments?", "response": "To correct a tax error on a posted invoice using legacy features, you would create an Invoice Item Adjustment. You should create a 'Credit' adjustment for the incorrect tax amount on the specific tax line item (if your configuration allows adjusting tax lines directly) or on the charge line. Then, if needed, you would issue a new invoice or a 'Charge' adjustment with the correct tax. Note that adjusting tax lines directly can be complex and depends on your specific tax engine configuration (Zuora Tax vs. External).", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Invoice adjustments"}
{"instruction": "I see 'Invoice Adjustment' and 'Invoice Item Adjustment' in the data source export. Which one should I use for reporting?", "response": "You should check both, but 'Invoice Item Adjustment' is the more granular and commonly used object in later legacy implementations. 'Invoice Adjustment' was the older header-level object. If your process involves adjusting specific line items (which is best practice), your data will likely be in the 'Invoice Item Adjustment' table. If you historically used header-level adjustments, you will need to include the 'Invoice Adjustment' table to get a complete picture of all adjustments.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Invoice adjustments"}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to cancel an Invoice Item Adjustment once it is processed?", "response": "Generally, processed Invoice Item Adjustments cannot be 'cancelled' or deleted to restore the invoice balance in a simple way. To reverse the effect of an adjustment, you typically have to create a *counter-adjustment*. For example, if you created a Credit adjustment of $10, you would create a Charge adjustment of $10 to net it out. However, some specific permissions (like 'Cancel Invoice Item Adjustment without Validation') might allow cancellation in certain states, but the counter-adjustment method is the standard audit-compliant path.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Invoice adjustments"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between a Bill-to and a Sold-to contact in Zuora?", "response": "The Bill-to contact determines the invoicing details, such as the email address for invoice delivery and the address printed on the invoice for payment purposes. The Sold-to contact represents the end user or service location and is primarily used for tax calculation, as tax jurisdictions are typically determined by the Sold-to address (Ship-to logic). While they can be the same contact record, splitting them allows you to bill one entity while delivering service (and calculating tax) for another.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Bill-to and Sold-to contacts"}
{"instruction": "How do I update the Sold-to contact for an existing subscription?", "response": "Updating the default Sold-to contact at the Account level does NOT automatically update existing subscriptions. To change the Sold-to contact for an active subscription, you must create an Order (or Amendment) to 'Update Terms and Conditions' or updating the subscription owner, depending on your configuration. You can then select the new contact for the specific subscription. This ensures that future invoices for that subscription use the correct tax address.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Bill-to and Sold-to contacts"}
{"instruction": "Why is the tax calculation using the Account address instead of the Subscription address?", "response": "This often happens if the subscription does not have a specific Sold-to contact explicitly assigned, causing it to fall back to the Account's default Sold-to contact. Verify that the specific subscription has been updated to point to the correct contact record. Additionally, check your taxation settings to ensure the tax engine is configured to use the 'Sold To' address rather than the 'Bill To' address for jurisdiction determination.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Bill-to and Sold-to contacts"}
{"instruction": "Can I have multiple subscriptions on one account with different Sold-to contacts?", "response": "Yes, you can have multiple subscriptions under a single Account, each assigned to a different Sold-to contact. This is a common use case for multi-location customers. However, be aware that if you bill them together, the invoice header will typically show the Account's default Sold-to contact, while the line items (taxation items) will calculate tax based on the individual subscription's Sold-to address.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Bill-to and Sold-to contacts"}
{"instruction": "Which contact's email address is used for emailing invoices?", "response": "Zuora sends the invoice email to the email address specified in the 'Work Email' field of the Bill-to contact associated with the invoice. It does not look at the Sold-to contact's email for invoice delivery.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Bill-to and Sold-to contacts"}
{"instruction": "I updated the Bill-to contact on the Account, but the latest invoice still shows the old address. Why?", "response": "Invoices in Zuora use a 'snapshot' of the contact details at the time the invoice was generated. Updating the contact record *after* invoice generation will not change the address on an already-posted invoice PDF. To fix this for a draft invoice, you may need to regenerate it. For a posted invoice, the data is historical and generally cannot be changed without canceling and rebilling.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Bill-to and Sold-to contacts"}
{"instruction": "How do I ensure the correct Sold-to contact is displayed on the Invoice PDF for line items?", "response": "If you have multiple subscriptions with different Sold-to contacts on one invoice, you need to configure your Invoice Template. Ensure that the 'Invoice Item' table in your template includes merge fields for the Sold-to Contact (e.g., `InvoiceItem.SoldToContact.Address1`). This allows the specific address relevant to each charge to be visible on the generated PDF.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Bill-to and Sold-to contacts"}
{"instruction": "What happens if I delete a contact that is currently used as a Bill-to or Sold-to on a subscription?", "response": "Zuora generally prevents you from deleting a Contact if it is actively associated with a Subscription or Account as a Bill-to or Sold-to contact. You must first update the Account or Subscription to point to a different contact before the system will allow you to delete the record.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Bill-to and Sold-to contacts"}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to have the Bill-to and Sold-to contact be the same person?", "response": "Yes, this is the default behavior when creating an account. If you do not specify a separate Sold-to contact, Zuora will often default the Sold-to contact to be the same record as the Bill-to contact. You can update them to be different later if needed.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Bill-to and Sold-to contacts"}
{"instruction": "How does the 'Sold-to' contact affect tax exemption?", "response": "Tax engines (like Avalara or Zuora Tax) typically validate tax exemption certificates against the entity considered the 'buyer' or consumer of the service. Since the Sold-to contact usually represents the location of consumption, the exemption status often needs to be associated with the customer entity linked to that Sold-to address, depending on the specific tax engine's logic.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Bill-to and Sold-to contacts"}
{"instruction": "What are the primary electronic payment methods supported by Zuora?", "response": "Zuora supports several primary electronic payment methods, including Credit Cards, ACH (Automated Clearing House), SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area), and Direct Debit UK (BACS).

{"instruction": "I am receiving a 'PayPal BAID is required' error when creating a payment method in Production, but it works in Sandbox. Why?", "response": "This error typically indicates a configuration mismatch between your Sandbox and Production environments. Specifically, for PayPal integrations (like PayPal Commerce Platform or Braintree), the 'BAID' (Billing Agreement ID) is a required field for recurring payments. In Production, the gateway might be enforcing strict validation requiring a Vault ID or Billing Agreement ID that isn't being passed or generated correctly, whereas Sandbox might be more lenient or configured differently.

{"instruction": "What is the difference between a 'Credit Card' payment method and a 'Credit Card Reference Transaction' in Zuora?", "response": "A 'Credit Card' payment method in Zuora typically involves storing the full card details (PAN, expiry, etc.) or a token representing them within Zuora's vault (if using Zuora's hosted pages). A 'Credit Card Reference Transaction' is a specific type of payment method used when the actual card details are tokenized and stored *externally* by the payment gateway (like Adyen or Worldpay), and Zuora only stores a 'Reference ID' or 'Token' to initiate future transactions.

{"instruction": "How can I update the 'Card Holder Name' on a Credit Card payment method via API?", "response": "To update fields like 'cardHolderName', you should generally use the `PUT /v1/payment-methods/{payment-method-id}` API endpoint. However, note that for some payment method types or specific fields, the REST API might have limitations compared to the legacy SOAP API. If the standard update endpoint does not support updating 'cardHolderName' for your specific gateway configuration, you might need to use the legacy `update()` call or create a new payment method with the correct details and mark it as default.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment methods (credit card, ACH, SEPA, etc.)"}
{"instruction": "Why does my SEPA payment show as 'Processed' immediately instead of 'Pending'?", "response": "SEPA payments are asynchronous by nature, meaning the funds are not settled immediately. However, in Zuora, the initial status often defaults to 'Processed' upon successful submission to the gateway unless 'Asynchronous Payment Statuses' are explicitly enabled and supported for that specific gateway and payment method type. If you are using a 'Credit Card Reference Transaction' to represent SEPA (as done with some Adyen integrations), Zuora treats it as a card transaction and may not support the 'Processing' or 'Pending' status flow, leading to an immediate 'Processed' status even if settlement hasn't occurred.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment methods (credit card, ACH, SEPA, etc.)"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'Payment Method Updater' and how do I set it up for Chase?", "response": "The Payment Method Updater (PMU) is a service that automatically updates credit card information (like expiry dates and new card numbers) by communicating with the card networks. To set it up for Chase, navigate to Settings > Payments > Setup Payment Method Updater. Select 'Chase' as the updater type.

{"instruction": "What conditions must be met for an invoice to be picked up by a Payment Run?", "response": "For an invoice to be picked up by a Payment Run, several conditions must be met: 1) The customer account must have 'Auto-Pay' enabled. 2) The invoice itself must have 'Auto-Pay' enabled (if the invoice-level override exists). 3) The invoice must be in 'Posted' status. 4) The invoice must have an open positive balance. 5) The Payment Run's 'Target Date' must be on or after the invoice's Due Date. 6) The account must have a valid default electronic payment method.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "How do I configure a Payment Run to process payments for invoices due by a specific date?", "response": "When creating or scheduling a Payment Run, you configure the 'Target Date'. The Payment Run will collect payments for all eligible invoices that have a Due Date on or before this Target Date. You can set this to a specific calendar date or, for scheduled runs, use a dynamic date like 'Day of Run' or 'Day of Run + X days'.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "Why was my invoice not picked up by the Payment Run even though Auto-Pay is on?", "response": "Common reasons for an invoice being skipped despite Auto-Pay being on include: 1) The invoice was posted *after* the Payment Run started. 2) The account's default payment method has reached the maximum number of consecutive failed payments allowed by your Payment Retry Rules (this disables auto-collection for that account). 3) The payment run's Target Date is before the invoice's Due Date. 4) The invoice or account is locked by another process (like a concurrent bill run or another payment run).", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "What happens if a payment method fails during a Payment Run?", "response": "If a payment method fails during a Payment Run, the payment is recorded with an 'Error' status. The invoice remains open (unpaid). Depending on your 'Payment Retry Rules', the system may count this as a consecutive failure. If the failure count reaches the configured limit, the system will stop attempting payments for that account in future runs until the payment method is updated or the counter is reset.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "How can I schedule a Payment Run to execute daily?", "response": "To schedule a daily Payment Run, navigate to Payments > Payment Runs. Click 'Create Payment Run' and select the 'Schedule' option. Choose 'Daily' as the frequency and set the start time. Ensure you configure the 'Target Date' logic (e.g., 'Day of Run') so that it dynamically picks up valid invoices each day it runs.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "What is the best practice for scheduling Payment Runs relative to Bill Runs?", "response": "It is best practice to schedule Payment Runs to occur *after* your Bill Runs have completed and invoices have been successfully posted. Allow a sufficient time buffer (e.g., several hours) between the scheduled Bill Run and the Payment Run to ensure all invoices are fully generated and posted. For example, if Bill Runs happen at midnight, schedule Payment Runs for 6:00 AM or later.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "Does a Payment Run retry failed payments?", "response": "A standard Payment Run attempts to collect on open invoices. It does not inherently 'retry' a specific failed payment transaction, but it *will* try to collect the invoice balance again in the next run if the invoice is still open and due. However, if you have 'Configurable Payment Retry' (CPR) enabled, Zuora can intelligently schedule retries according to a custom schedule, often separating the retry logic from the standard daily payment run.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "How do I prevent a specific invoice from being paid by the automatic Payment Run?", "response": "To prevent a specific invoice from being paid automatically, you can edit the invoice and set the 'Auto-Pay' flag to 'False' (or uncheck the box) at the invoice level. This overrides the account-level Auto-Pay setting for that specific document, excluding it from Payment Runs while leaving other invoices on the account eligible.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "What does the 'Process payments even if the default payment method is closed' setting do?", "response": "This setting in the Payment Run configuration allows the system to attempt a payment using the account's default payment method even if that method is marked as 'Closed' in Zuora. This is useful for scenarios where a card might be expired or closed in Zuora records but the gateway might still honor a transaction (e.g., via account updater logic), though typically it is better to update the payment method first.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "Why did my Payment Run fail with 'System Error' or processed 0 payments unexpectedly?", "response": "A 'System Error' or unexpected 0 processed count can occur due to transient platform issues, but often it is due to configuration conflicts like filters that exclude all accounts, or the 'Payment Retry' limit being hit for the target accounts. If the run failed completely, check the 'Payment Run' details page for specific error messages. If it processed 0, verify that there were actually posted, open, auto-pay enabled invoices due by the target date for the batch of accounts selected.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "Can I use a Payment Run to collect payments for a specific batch of customers?", "response": "Yes, when configuring a Payment Run, you can filter the accounts to include. You can select a specific 'Batch' (e.g., Batch 1, Batch 2) or use a 'Bill Cycle Day' filter. This allows you to segment your collections, for example, running payments only for the 'Enterprise' batch today and the 'SMB' batch tomorrow.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "How does the 'Configurable Payment Retry' (CPR) feature interact with Payment Runs?", "response": "When CPR is enabled, it takes over the management of failed payments. If a payment fails, CPR automatically schedules the next retry attempt based on your rules. During this retry cycle, CPR typically disables the 'Auto-Pay' flag on the invoice or account to prevent the standard Payment Run from grabbing it and causing double-attempts or conflicts. Once the retry cycle resolves (success or final failure), CPR updates the status accordingly.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "What should I do if a Payment Run gets stuck in 'Processing' state?", "response": "If a Payment Run remains in 'Processing' state for an unusually long time (e.g., significantly longer than typical for your volume), do not immediately try to cancel or re-run it, as it might still be communicating with the gateway. Check the Payment Run logs for progress. If it is genuinely stuck, you may need to contact Zuora Support to investigate the backend job status before attempting any manual intervention to avoid duplicate payments.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment runs and auto-pay"}
{"instruction": "How do I apply unapplied credit memos automatically during a Payment Run?", "response": "In the Payment Run configuration settings, you can enable the option 'Auto-apply unapplied credit memos'.

{"instruction": "What does it mean to 'Apply' a payment in Zuora?", "response": "In Zuora, 'Applying' a payment means taking a payment that has been collected (and is in 'Processed' status) and allocating its amount to one or more specific billing documents, such as Invoices or Debit Memos. This action reduces the 'Balance Due' of those documents. A payment can be applied fully to a single invoice, partially across multiple invoices, or left partially unapplied as a balance on the account.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "How can I unapply a payment from an invoice using the Zuora UI?", "response": "To unapply a payment in the UI, navigate to the Payments section and select the specific Payment record. Click the 'Unapply' button (sometimes located in the 'More' menu). In the unapply dialog, you can choose to unapply the full amount or a partial amount from the specific invoices it was applied to. Confirming this action increases the balance of the invoice(s) and moves the unapplied funds to the 'Unapplied Amount' of the payment.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "I see a 'Payment Application' object in the Data Source extract. What information does it contain?", "response": "The 'Payment Application' object tracks the specific link between a Payment and a billing document (Invoice or Debit Memo). It contains fields like `ApplyAmount` (how much was applied), `InvoiceId` (which invoice it paid), `PaymentId` (the source payment), and `EffectiveDate`. It is the audit trail for how funds were distributed. Note that negative amounts in this object typically represent unapplication events.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "Why am I unable to unapply a payment for a very large invoice (over 20k lines)?", "response": "Zuora has known performance limitations when unapplying payments from invoices with an extremely large number of line items (e.g., >15k-20k lines). The synchronous unapply process may timeout. In such cases, Zuora may use an asynchronous process. If you encounter a specific error or the UI hangs, it might be due to a bug in the async handling of large invoices (as seen in some reported issues) or simply a processing delay. You may need to use the API for async unapplication or contact Support if it fails repeatedly.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between 'Unapplied Payment' and 'Credit Balance'?", "response": "An 'Unapplied Payment' represents funds that are held *on a specific Payment transaction* that have not yet been allocated to an invoice. It keeps the money tied to the original payment method/transaction. A 'Credit Balance' is a generic pool of funds on the *Customer Account* level, often created from overpayments or credit memos, that is not tied to a specific payment transaction source in the same way. Invoice Settlement features focus on using Unapplied Payments directly.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "How does the 'Default Application Rule' affect payment application?", "response": "The 'Default Application Rule' (configured in Payments Settings) determines how a payment amount is automatically distributed across the line items of an invoice when you apply it. The common rules are 'Proration' (distributes proportionally based on line item balances) or 'First-In-First-Out' (FIFO - pays off lines in order). While you can override this in API calls, the system defaults to this logic for UI and auto-apply operations.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "Can I apply a payment to an invoice that is in 'Draft' status?", "response": "No, you can only apply payments to invoices that are in 'Posted' status. Draft invoices are not considered final debts and therefore cannot have payments allocated to them.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "How do I configure Zuora to automatically apply unapplied payments during a Payment Run?", "response": "In the Payment Run configuration (or scheduler), there is an option labeled 'Auto-apply unapplied payments'. If you enable this, the payment run will first look for any existing unapplied payment amounts on the customer account and apply them to the open eligible invoices *before* attempting to collect a new payment for the remaining balance.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "I tried to unapply a payment but got an error about 'Accounting Period Closed'. What should I do?", "response": "You cannot unapply a payment if the transaction date or the unapplication effective date falls within a closed accounting period, because unapplying changes the GL balances (AR and Cash). To resolve this, you must either re-open the accounting period (if permitted by your finance policy) or, more commonly, set the 'Effective Date' of the unapplication to a date in the *current* open accounting period.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "Why does a payment show as 'Unapplied' immediately after creation?", "response": "This happens if the payment was created as a standalone payment without specifying an invoice to apply to, or if the application logic failed/was skipped. If you intended it to pay a specific invoice, check your API call to ensure `invoiceId` was passed, or check your Payment Run settings. It is a valid state; the funds are on the account waiting to be applied.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "Can I partial-unapply a payment?", "response": "Yes, you can partially unapply a payment. In the UI or API, you specify the amount you want to unapply. For example, if a $100 payment is applied to an invoice, you can unapply $20, leaving $80 applied and moving $20 to the Unapplied Amount balance.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "How do I transfer an unapplied payment balance to a different invoice?", "response": "To transfer an unapplied balance, you effectively perform two steps: 1) Unapply the payment from the original invoice (if it was applied), making it 'Unapplied'. 2) Apply that unapplied amount to the new target invoice. There isn't a single 'Transfer' button that does both in one click for payments (unlike Credit Balance transfers), so you manage it via the Apply/Unapply flows.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "What happens to the invoice balance when I unapply a payment?", "response": "When you unapply a payment, the balance of the invoice increases by the amount unapplied. The invoice status may change from 'Paid' back to 'Posted' (open) if it is no longer fully settled.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "Is 'Invoice Item Settlement' required to unapply payments?", "response": "Strictly speaking, 'Invoice Item Settlement' (IIS) enables line-item level application visibility and control. While you can unapply payments without IIS (at the header level in legacy models), enabling Invoice Settlement (the broader feature) is typically required for the modern 'Unapply' functionality that tracks unapplied balances on the payment object itself. IIS adds granularity but the core Unapply capability is part of the Invoice Settlement feature set.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "Why does the 'Payment Application' extraction show negative amounts?", "response": "In the Payment Application data source, records with negative 'ApplyAmount' values represent 'Unapplication' events. For example, if you applied $100 (positive record) and then unapplied $100, you will see a second record with -$100. The sum of these records determines the net amount applied.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment application and unapplication"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between an 'Electronic' (Internal) refund and an 'External' refund in Zuora?", "response": "An **Electronic Refund** (often referred to as an internal refund) is a transaction triggered directly from Zuora that communicates with the payment gateway to return funds to the customer's original payment method (e.g., credit card or ACH). Zuora processes the transaction and updates the records automatically.\n\nAn **External Refund** is a bookkeeping entry in Zuora used to record a refund that was processed outside of the system (e.g., you issued a paper check, sent a wire transfer, or processed a refund directly in the payment gateway's portal). External refunds do not trigger any communication with payment gateways; they simply update the balance and GL in Zuora to reflect that money was returned.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Refunds (internal vs external)"}
{"instruction": "When should I use an External Refund instead of an Electronic Refund?", "response": "You should use an **External Refund** in the following scenarios:\n1.  **Non-Electronic Payments:** The original payment was made via check, cash, or wire transfer, so there is no gateway transaction to reverse electronically.\n2.  **Gateway Limitations:** The payment gateway no longer supports refunding the specific transaction (e.g., the transaction is too old, usually >12-18 months depending on the gateway).\n3.  **Closed/Changed Gateways:** The payment gateway account used for the original payment has been closed or deactivated in Zuora, preventing an electronic refund.\n4.  **Manual Intervention:** You processed the refund directly in the gateway's virtual terminal or portal and need to sync Zuora's records to match.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Refunds (internal vs external)"}
{"instruction": "How do I issue an External Refund for a credit card payment that failed to refund electronically?", "response": "If an electronic refund fails (e.g., due to a closed gateway or expired token), you can record it as an External Refund:\n1.  Navigate to **Payments** and select the payment you wish to refund.\n2.  Click **More > Refund this payment**.\n3.  In the refund screen, look for the **Refund Type** or **Type** option and select **External** (instead of Electronic).\n4.  Enter the **Refund Amount**.\n5.

{"instruction": "I received an error 'Gateway does not support cancel' or 'Original gateway not found' when trying to refund. How do I fix this?", "response": "This error occurs because Zuora is trying to process an **Electronic Refund** against a gateway configuration that is no longer active, valid, or supports the operation for that specific transaction. To resolve this:\n1.  Log in to your payment gateway's portal directly and issue the refund there.\n2.  Return to Zuora and create a refund for that payment.\n3.

This keeps your Zuora ledger in sync with the bank without trying to trigger the defunct gateway connection.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Refunds (internal vs external)"}
{"instruction": "Can I perform a partial refund using the External Refund method?", "response": "Yes, just like electronic refunds, **External Refunds** can be partial. When creating the refund in the UI or API, simply enter an **Amount** that is less than the total unapplied amount of the payment. You can issue multiple partial external refunds against a single payment until the full payment amount has been refunded.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Refunds (internal vs external)"}
{"instruction": "What is the API endpoint to create an external refund?", "response": "To create an external refund programmatically, use the **Create a refund** REST API endpoint: `POST /v1/object/refund` (or `POST /v1/refunds` for the newer transaction service). In the request body, you must specify:\n*   `Type`: Set this to `External`.\n*   `PaymentId`: The ID of the payment being refunded.\n*   `Amount`: The amount to refund.\n*   `MethodType`: The method used (e.g., `Check`, `WireTransfer`, `Cash`, `Other`).\n*   `SourceType`: Typically `Payment`.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Refunds (internal vs external)"}
{"instruction": "Does creating an External Refund automatically move money from my bank account?", "response": "No. Creating an **External Refund** in Zuora is strictly a **recording** action. It tells Zuora's billing and finance engines that you have *already* returned the funds to the customer via another channel (e.g., mailed a check or logged into Stripe/Adyen separately). It does **not** trigger any money movement or bank transfer instruction.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Refunds (internal vs external)"}
{"instruction": "How do Real-Time Reconciliation (RTR) events affect External Refunds?", "response": "If you use Real-Time Reconciliation (RTR) with gateways like Stripe or PayPal, certain events—such as a **chargeback** or a **dispute resolution** in favor of the customer—may automatically trigger the creation of an **External Refund** in Zuora. This automation ensures that when money is forcibly taken back by the gateway, Zuora's records automatically reflect this loss without manual intervention.

{"instruction": "How do refunds behave if the invoice is already 'Closed' or the Accounting Period is closed?", "response": "You can issue a refund even if the invoice is closed/paid. However, if the **Accounting Period** for the refund date is closed, Zuora will typically block the transaction or require you to choose a refund date in an **Open** accounting period.

{"instruction": "Can I automate the write-off process for invoices that are X days past due?", "response": "Yes, you can automate write-offs using Zuora Workflow. A common pattern is to create a workflow that queries for invoices that are past due by a certain number of days (e.g., >120 days) and have a specific status.

{"instruction": "How do I reverse a write-off if it was done by mistake?", "response": "Since a write-off in Invoice Settlement creates a posted Credit Memo, you cannot simply 'delete' it. To reverse the effect, you must create a Debit Memo for the same amount and apply the Credit Memo to this new Debit Memo (to net them out), or cancel the Credit Memo if your tenant configuration allows canceling posted memos (which is rare/restricted).

{"instruction": "Why are 'Hard Decline' errors (e.g., Stolen Card) being retried even though I intended to stop them?", "response": "This issue often stems from incorrect Response Code Mapping. In the CPR app, check the 'Response Codes' tab. If a specific gateway error code (e.g., Stripe's '402') is not explicitly mapped to the 'Hard Decline' label, CPR may default to the 'Default Label' setting, which is often set to 'Soft Decline' or 'System Error' (triggering a retry). You must explicitly map the specific error code and description from your gateway to the 'Hard Decline' label to ensure the retry cycle stops immediately.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment retries and dunning"}
{"instruction": "Can Configurable Payment Retry be used for Bank Transfer (ACH/Direct Debit) payment methods?", "response": "Generally, CPR is designed for real-time payment methods like Credit Cards that return immediate response codes. Bank Transfers often do not return a synchronous error code; instead, they stay in a 'Processing' state before eventually updating to 'Settled' or 'FailedToSettle'. Because CPR relies on immediate gateway response codes to trigger specific logic, it effectively does not support Bank Transfer methods. You should manage Bank Transfer failures using separate notifications or workflows triggered by the 'Payment Status Changed' event.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment retries and dunning"}
{"instruction": "How do I map a generic gateway error code, like Stripe's '402', to different retry behaviors?", "response": "Since some gateways like Stripe use a single code (e.g., '402') for multiple failure reasons, you must map based on the 'Response Message' or description rather than just the code. In the CPR 'Response Codes' tab, instead of mapping solely by the code '402', use the 'Import' feature to upload a CSV that maps the specific error descriptions (e.g., '402: Insufficient Funds' vs. '402: Card Stolen') to your desired labels (Soft Decline vs. Hard Decline). This allows CPR to distinguish between retriable and non-retriable errors sharing the same code.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment retries and dunning"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended best practice for running CPR alongside Zuora's native payment run retries?", "response": "You must disable Zuora's native 'Payment Run retry rules' when using Configurable Payment Retry. Running both simultaneously can cause race conditions, duplicate retries, and conflicting logic where a payment might be retried by the native system while CPR is also attempting to schedule it. Disable the native rules in Settings > Payments > Configure Payment Retry Rules to ensure CPR is the sole engine managing retries.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Payment retries and dunning"}
{"instruction": "A payment failed, but the configured dunning workflow did not trigger. What should I check first?", "response": "First, verify that the 'Payment Run Completion' notification callout is active in 'Settings > Setup Profiles, Notifications and Email Templates'. If this notification is not enabled or if the callout fails, CPR will not receive the signal to evaluate the payment failure. Second, check the CPR 'System Health' or 'Failures' dashboard to see if the payment was successfully ingested by CPR. Finally, ensure the customer account's 'Communication Profile' allows notifications and is not set to 'Silent', as this can sometimes suppress callouts.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment retries and dunning"}
{"instruction": "How can I stop an active retry cycle for a specific invoice that is currently being processed by CPR?", "response": "You cannot simply 'cancel' a retry from the UI for a single invoice once it is in the queue. The most effective way to stop the retry cycle for a specific invoice is to manually turn off the 'Auto-Pay' flag on that invoice or the associated customer account. CPR checks the Auto-Pay status before every attempt; if it detects that Auto-Pay is disabled, it will abort the scheduled retry and the cycle will effectively end.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payment retries and dunning"}
{"instruction": "What are the limitations of using the 'System Error' label in response code mapping?", "response": "Mapping a code to 'System Error' typically triggers a retry logic intended for transient technical issues (e.g., network timeouts). However, if a gateway persistently returns a 'System Error' for a valid reason (like a configuration mismatch), CPR may retry indefinitely or until the max attempt limit is reached, causing unnecessary transaction volume. It is best practice to review 'System Error' failures regularly and re-map persistent non-transient errors to 'Hard Decline' to prevent wasted API calls.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Payment retries and dunning"}
{"instruction": "How does CPR handle retry schedules if I change the logic for a Customer Group mid-cycle?", "response": "If you modify the retry logic (e.g., increase attempts from 3 to 5) for a Customer Group, the changes typically apply only to *new* retry cycles triggered after the change. Invoices already in an active retry cycle will continue to follow the logic that was active at the time they entered the cycle. To apply new logic to existing failures, you would effectively need to stop their current cycle (e.g., disable/enable auto-pay) and let them re-enter the flow, though simply letting the old cycle finish is the standard recommendation.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment retries and dunning"}
{"instruction": "What is the primary purpose of a \"Terms and Conditions\" amendment in Zuora?", "response": "A \"Terms and Conditions\" amendment is used to modify the overall structure of a subscription. It allows you to change the subscription's term length (Initial or Renewal Term), the term type (e.g., switching from Termed to Evergreen), the auto-renew setting, and the term start dates. It does not directly add or remove products, but it redefines the contract duration and renewal rules.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "How do I add a new product to an existing subscription using an amendment?", "response": "To add a new product, create an amendment with the type \"NewProduct\". You must specify the `ContractEffectiveDate` (when the contract allows the addition) and typically the `ServiceActivationDate` (when the service actually begins). You will also select the specific Product Rate Plan from the Product Catalog to add to the subscription. This amendment effectively appends a new Rate Plan charge to the existing subscription version.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "What fields are mandatory when creating a \"Remove Product\" amendment via the API?", "response": "When creating a \"Remove Product\" amendment via the API, you must provide the `RatePlanId` of the specific rate plan you wish to remove (this is the ID of the rate plan on the subscription, not the product catalog ID). You also need to specify the `ContractEffectiveDate` which serves as the cancellation date for that specific product. The `ServiceActivationDate` and `CustomerAcceptanceDate` may also be required depending on your tenant's billing settings.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "Explain the difference between a \"Renewal\" amendment and the \"Auto-Renew\" system setting.", "response": "A \"Renewal\" amendment is an explicit transactional object created to extend a subscription for a specific duration (e.g., another 12 months) starting from the end of the current term. It creates a new version of the subscription and effectively locks in the renewal. In contrast, \"Auto-Renew\" is a setting on the subscription (controlled by T&C amendments) that tells the system to automatically generate a renewal amendment when the current term ends, without manual intervention.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "I received an error saying \"Contract Effective Date cannot be earlier than the Subscription Term Start Date\" when trying to add a new product. What does this mean?", "response": "This error occurs because you cannot amend a subscription to add a product on a date that precedes the subscription's own existence. Ensure that your \"New Product\" amendment's `ContractEffectiveDate` is on or after the original subscription's start date. If you need to backdate a product add-on, it must still fall within valid active term boundaries of the subscription.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "What is the best practice for aligning a \"New Product\" amendment with an existing subscription term?", "response": "When adding a new product mid-term, it is best practice to align the end date of the new product rate plan with the end date of the underlying subscription term (Co-terming). This ensures that all products on the subscription renew together. You can achieve this by setting the new rate plan's end date setting to \"Align to Subscription End Date\" during the amendment process.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "Can I use a \"Remove Product\" amendment to cancel a subscription completely?", "response": "No, a \"Remove Product\" amendment removes specific rate plans (products) from a subscription but leaves the subscription container active (even if it has zero products, depending on settings). To cancel the entire subscription and stop all billing and lifecycle events, you must use a \"Cancellation\" amendment type, which terminates the subscription entirely.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "What happens if I create a \"Renewal\" amendment before the current term ends?", "response": "Creating a \"Renewal\" amendment before the current term ends queues the renewal to take effect immediately after the current term's end date. This extends the `SubscriptionEndDate` by the renewal term duration. This is common in scenarios where a customer agrees to a renewal early, and you want to book the renewal order immediately rather than waiting for the auto-renew logic to trigger.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "How does a \"Terms and Conditions\" amendment affect the `TermEndDate`?", "response": "A \"Terms and Conditions\" amendment recalculates the `TermEndDate` based on the changes you make. For example, if you change the \"Initial Term\" from 12 months to 24 months, the system will extend the `TermEndDate` to reflect the new 24-month duration calculated from the original `TermStartDate`. It essentially resizes the current term container.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to undo a \"Remove Product\" amendment once it has been activated?", "response": "Once an amendment is created and processed, it cannot be simply \"deleted\" if it has generated invoices or recognized revenue. To \"undo\" a removal, you would typically need to create a new \"New Product\" amendment to re-add the product back onto the subscription with a new start date. If the amendment has not been invoiced, you may be able to delete the amendment object itself via the API to revert the subscription to its previous state.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "What specific date fields are required for a \"Terms and Conditions\" amendment?", "response": "For a \"Terms and Conditions\" amendment, you are required to provide the `ContractEffectiveDate`. Additionally, if you are changing the term structure, you may need to populate `InitialTerm`, `RenewalTerm`, and `TermType`. If the tenant uses the \"Service Activation\" or \"Customer Acceptance\" dates, those fields may also be required depending on your specific tenant configuration.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "Can I perform a \"New Product\" and \"Remove Product\" action in the same amendment call?", "response": "In the strict definition of the `Amendment` object, each amendment has a single `Type` (e.g., `NewProduct` OR `RemoveProduct`). To perform a \"Swap\" or \"Upgrade/Downgrade\" where you add one product and remove another simultaneously, you effectively create an Order (via the Orders API) that contains multiple Order Actions, or you create multiple Amendment objects in sequence. You cannot have a single Amendment object be both type `NewProduct` and `RemoveProduct`.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "What is the \"Booking Date\" on an amendment and why is it important?", "response": "The `BookingDate` is a field on the Amendment object that represents the date when the deal was agreed upon or \"booked\" for reporting purposes. It differs from the `ContractEffectiveDate` (when billing/legal terms start). It is critical for revenue reporting, sales commission calculations, and metrics analysis to recognize when the amendment transaction technically occurred versus when it becomes effective.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Amendment types (terms and conditions, new product, remove product, renewal)"}
{"instruction": "What constitutes a \"mid-term change\" in Zuora and how is it different from a renewal?", "response": "A mid-term change refers to any modification made to an active subscription between its start date and its term end date. Examples include upgrades (swapping products), downgrades, adding new products (cross-sell), changing quantities, or updating pricing. Unlike a renewal, which extends the subscription term from the end date, a mid-term change takes effect immediately or on a specific future date within the current term, typically triggering proration logic to calculate partial-period charges or credits.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Mid-term changes"}
{"instruction": "How do I perform a product upgrade (e.g., Silver to Gold plan) in the middle of a subscription term?", "response": "To perform an upgrade, you must create an Order (or Amendment) that contains two actions: 1) A 'Remove Product' action for the current plan (e.g., Silver) and 2) An 'Add Product' action for the new plan (e.g., Gold). It is critical to set the 'Contract Effective Date' for both actions to the same date (the date the upgrade takes effect). This ensures the old plan stops billing and the new plan starts billing on the exact same day, allowing Zuora to calculate the net proration correctly.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Mid-term changes"}
{"instruction": "I want to increase the quantity of an existing product mid-term. Should I use 'Add Product' or 'Update Product'?", "response": "You should use the 'Update Product' order action. This action allows you to modify the 'Quantity' field of an existing Rate Plan Charge without removing it. By setting the specific effective date for the update, Zuora will automatically calculate the prorated charge for the additional units for the remainder of the current billing period.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Mid-term changes"}
{"instruction": "Why did my customer receive a credit memo after I removed a product mid-term?", "response": "When you remove a product before the end of its billed period, Zuora's proration logic automatically calculates a credit for the 'unused' days that the customer had already paid for. For example, if a customer paid for a full month but you remove the product on day 15, Zuora generates a proration credit for the remaining 15 days. To avoid this credit, you should set the removal effective date to the end of the current billing period (term end) rather than a mid-term date.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Mid-term changes"}
{"instruction": "I am trying to add a product mid-term but receiving an error about a \"future-dated amendment\". How do I fix this?", "response": "This error occurs if the subscription already has a future-dated change (like a scheduled Renewal or a future cancellation) that locks the subscription version. You cannot insert a mid-term change 'before' that future change using the standard flow. To resolve this, you must either 1) Delete the future-dated amendment/order, perform your mid-term change, and then re-create the future change, or 2) Use the 'Update' logic with specific advanced options (if available in your UI/API version) that allow inserting changes prior to future versions.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Mid-term changes"}
{"instruction": "Does Zuora automatically prorate the 'included units' (entitlements) when I make a mid-term change?", "response": "No, by default, Zuora prorates the *monetary charge* but does not automatically prorate the *included units* or entitlements for the partial period. For example, if you add a product on the 15th of the month that includes 100 units/month, the customer may get the full 100 units for that partial month unless you explicitly configure the usage charge or entitlement settings to handle proration differently. You must verify your specific 'Overage Calculation' and proration settings to ensure entitlements behave as expected.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Mid-term changes"}
{"instruction": "What are the small \"bridge\" charges (e.g., $0.55) I see on an invoice after a mid-term change?", "response": "These are typically daily proration adjustments that occur when a mid-term change aligns the subscription to a specific 'Bill Cycle Day'. If the new product's billing period aligns with a specific day of the month (e.g., the 1st) and you add it on a different day (e.g., the 20th), Zuora may generate a small, separate charge to cover the 'bridge' period (from the 20th to the 1st) before the regular full recurring billing cycle begins.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Mid-term changes"}
{"instruction": "How can I schedule a downgrade to happen automatically at the end of the current term instead of immediately?", "response": "Create a 'Remove Product' order action (for the current product) and an 'Add Product' order action (for the downgraded product), but set the 'Contract Effective Date', 'Service Activation Date', and 'Customer Acceptance Date' for both actions to equal the subscription's 'Term End Date' (or the start of the next renewal term). This effectively schedules the change to occur seamlessly at renewal without prorating the current term.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Mid-term changes"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between 'Cancel and Rebook' vs. 'Amendment' for handling mid-term changes?", "response": "'Amendment' (or Order Actions) modifies the *existing* subscription, preserving the version history, subscriber ID, and reporting continuity (e.g., NRR, ARR growth). 'Cancel and Rebook' involves canceling the old subscription and creating a brand new one. Zuora strongly recommends using Amendments/Order Actions for mid-term changes to maintain accurate 'Net Retention' metrics and avoid creating disjointed customer records, whereas 'Cancel and Rebook' should be reserved for scenarios where the contract relationship fundamentally changes.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Mid-term changes"}
{"instruction": "How do I change the price of a product for a specific customer in the middle of their subscription?", "response": "Use the 'Update Product' order action on the specific Rate Plan Charge you wish to change. In the order action, you can override the 'Price' field with the new value. Set the effective date to when you want the new price to apply. Zuora will credit the remaining value of the old price and charge the new price for the remainder of the period (proration), or simply apply the new price going forward if done at the start of a billing cycle.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Mid-term changes"}
{"instruction": "Can I reverse a mid-term change if I made a mistake?", "response": "If the order/amendment has not yet been invoiced (posted), you can typically delete the Order or Amendment object to revert the subscription to its previous state. However, if the change has already been invoiced, you cannot simply delete it. You must create a new 'correcting' order (e.g., a new Amendment to reverse the changes) to fix the subscription state and then issue Credit/Debit Memos to correct the financial balance.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Mid-term changes"}
{"instruction": "What are the three main trigger dates used for effective dating in Zuora subscriptions?", "response": "The three main trigger dates are:\n1.  **Contract Effective Date (CED):** The date when the contract legally begins. It typically drives the start of the subscription term.\n2.  **Service Activation Date (SAD):** The date when the service is actually enabled or provisioned for the customer. This can be used to delay billing until service delivery.\n3.  **Customer Acceptance Date (CAD):** The date when the customer formally accepts the service (e.g., after UAT). This is often used for revenue recognition triggers.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Effective dating"}
{"instruction": "How do I configure Zuora to automatically sync the Service Activation and Customer Acceptance dates with the Contract Effective Date?", "response": "In Zuora's Default Subscription Settings, you can configure the \"Require Service Activation of Orders?\" and \"Require Customer Acceptance of Orders?\" settings. If you set these options to \"No\", the system will automatically default the Service Activation Date and Customer Acceptance Date to match the Contract Effective Date you provide during subscription creation. This simplifies the order process if you don't need distinct provisioning or acceptance triggers.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Effective dating"}
{"instruction": "I am receiving an error: \"The contract effective date should not be earlier than the customer acceptance date of the basic subscription\" when creating an amendment. What does this mean?", "response": "This error occurs because you are trying to backdate an amendment to a date *before* the subscription's current active version's trigger dates. Zuora validation rules prevent you from creating a new order action (like an amendment or terms change) with a Contract Effective Date that precedes the Customer Acceptance Date of the original subscription or the previous amendment. You must set your amendment's effective dates to be on or after the trigger dates of the base subscription.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Effective dating"}
{"instruction": "Can I have different trigger dates for different products on the same subscription?", "response": "Yes, trigger dates can be set at the **Rate Plan Charge** level. When creating a subscription or amendment, you can specify different Service Activation or Customer Acceptance dates for individual charges if your Product Catalog is configured to trigger on those specific dates. This allows you to start billing for different products (e.g., a platform fee vs. an add-on service) at different times within the same subscription.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Effective dating"}
{"instruction": "How does the \"Trigger Condition\" setting in the Product Catalog affect billing start dates?", "response": "In the Product Catalog, every charge has a \"Trigger Condition\" setting (e.g., \"Upon Contract Effective\", \"Upon Service Activation\", or \"Upon Customer Acceptance\"). This setting tells the billing engine *which* of the three dates to use as the billing start date for that specific charge. If a charge is set to trigger on \"Service Activation\", billing will not start until the Service Activation Date is populated on the subscription, even if the Contract Effective Date has passed.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Effective dating"}
{"instruction": "If I update the Contract Effective Date on an active subscription, will it automatically update the Service Activation Date?", "response": "Not necessarily. If the subscription is already active and the dates were previously set, updating the Contract Effective Date via an amendment or order action does not automatically shift the Service Activation Date or Customer Acceptance Date unless you explicitly update those fields as well, or if your tenant settings are configured to keep them synchronized (defaulting logic often applies only at creation). You should explicitly provide all relevant dates in your API call to ensure they align as intended.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Effective dating"}
{"instruction": "What happens if I don't provide a Service Activation Date for a charge that is set to trigger \"Upon Service Activation\"?", "response": "If a charge's trigger condition is \"Upon Service Activation\" and you do not provide a Service Activation Date, the charge will remain in a \"Pending\" status and will **not be billed**. The subscription may be active, but that specific charge will generate zero revenue until the date is populated. This is a common reason for missing charges on invoices.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Effective dating"}
{"instruction": "How do I backdate a subscription start date correctly using effective dating?", "response": "To backdate a subscription, you simply set the **Contract Effective Date** (and other required trigger dates) to a date in the past (e.g., last month) during the subscription creation order. Zuora will treat the subscription as having started on that past date. When you next run a bill run, Zuora will generate an invoice that includes catch-up billing for the period from that past date to the present (proration), assuming the bill run's Target Date covers that period.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Effective dating"}
{"instruction": "What is the best practice for handling \"Future Dated\" amendments with effective dating?", "response": "For future-dated changes (e.g., an upgrade starting next month), you should create an amendment order where the **Contract Effective Date** is set to that future date. Zuora will keep the current subscription version active until that date arrives. On the effective date, the system will automatically transition to the new version and begin billing the new charges. Avoid changing the current version's dates; instead, use a new order action with the future effective date.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Effective dating"}
{"instruction": "Why does the Salesforce subscription show the same trigger dates for all versions while Zuora Billing shows different dates?", "response": "This is a known sync behavior. Zuora Billing stores unique trigger dates for *each version* (amendment) of a subscription. However, the standard Zuora CPQ/Salesforce integration typically syncs and displays the dates from the **latest** subscription version on the Salesforce Subscription object. Therefore, Salesforce may show the most recent amendment's effective dates as if they apply to the whole history, whereas Zuora Billing retains the granular, version-specific history.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Effective dating"}
3{"instruction": "What is the difference between \"previewing\" and \"executing\" an order or billing operation in Zuora?", "response": "Previewing an operation (like an order or a bill run) simulates the action to show you the expected results—such as charge metrics, invoice items, and tax calculations—without committing any changes to the database or generating legal documents.

{"instruction": "How do I preview the invoices for a new subscription before activating it?", "response": "You can use the `POST /v1/orders/preview` API. In the request body, define your `orderDate` and the `createSubscription` order action with the desired rate plans. Include the `previewOptions` object, setting `previewTypes` to `[\"BillingDocs\"]`.

{"instruction": "Why do I see \"PREVIEW-INV...\" or \"PREVIEW-VIRTUAL...\" codes in my tax provider reports?", "response": "These codes appear because you (or your system) triggered a preview call that required a tax calculation. Zuora sends a temporary transaction to your tax vendor (like Avalara) to get an accurate tax estimate.

{"instruction": "What is the best practice for validating complex quotes before closing a deal?", "response": "Best practice is to always execute an Order Preview (`POST /v1/orders/preview`) with `previewTypes: [\"BillingDocs\", \"ChargeMetrics\"]` for complex quotes.

{"instruction": "How does Zuora handle rating for usage records that span across multiple billing periods?", "response": "Zuora generally requires usage records to align with billing periods. Best practice is to upload separate usage records for each billing period (e.g., one record for Jan 1-31, another for Feb 1-28).

{"instruction": "How does the 'Overage Pricing' model work and what is 'Smoothing'?", "response": "**Overage Pricing** gives the customer a set amount of 'included units' for free or as part of a recurring fee, and charges a per-unit rate only for usage exceeding that allowance. **Smoothing** is a feature that averages usage over a longer period (e.g., Year) rather than billing strictly by month, helping customers with seasonal spikes avoid overage charges in a single high-usage month.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Usage-based billing models"}
{"instruction": "Can I use 'Attribute-Based Pricing' for usage charges?", "response": "Yes, **Attribute-Based Pricing** (part of the Dynamic Pricing capability) allows you to determine the price of a usage record based on its specific attributes (e.g., 'Region', 'ServiceType') rather than just quantity.

{"instruction": "How does the 'Overage Calculation Option' setting affect when customers are billed?", "response": "This setting, found on the Rate Plan Charge, determines the timing of the calculation. If set to **End of Smoothing Period**, the system waits until the entire smoothing interval (e.g., Year 1) is complete before summing usage and billing any overage. If set to **Per Billing Period**, overage is calculated and billed each billing cycle (e.g., monthly), which is standard for non-smoothed charges.", "category": "configuration", "topic": "Overage calculations"}
{"instruction": "Why was my customer not charged for overage even though they exceeded their monthly allowance?", "response": "If you are using a **Smoothing Model**, check the **Overage Calculation Option**. If it is set to 'End of Smoothing Period', Zuora will not bill the overage until the full smoothing interval (e.g., the end of the year) has passed, regardless of monthly spikes. Alternatively, confirm that the **Included Units** were not reset or increased by a recent amendment.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Overage calculations"}
{"instruction": "Can I use the 'On Demand' usage rating option with Overage Pricing?", "response": "No, **Overage Pricing** and **Tiered with Overage** charge models are **not supported** with the 'On Demand' rating option. These models require the full context of the billing period (total accumulated usage) to determine if the allowance has been exceeded, so they can only be rated during a Bill Run at the end of the period.", "category": "limitations", "topic": "Overage calculations"}
{"instruction": "How do I configure unused units to carry over to the next month?", "response": "Enable **Smoothing** on the charge and set the **Smoothing Model** to **Rollover**. You must also define the **Number of Periods** (e.g., '1' to roll over to the immediate next period, or higher for a longer window). This allows unused 'Included Units' from one billing period to be added to the allowance of the subsequent period(s).", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Overage calculations"}
{"instruction": "What happens to overage calculations if a subscription is cancelled mid-period?", "response": "If a subscription with an overage charge is cancelled early, Zuora typically **prorates** the 'Included Units' based on the time the subscription was active in that period (unless 'Proration' is disabled). The actual usage is then compared against this reduced, prorated allowance to determine if an overage occurred.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Overage calculations"}
{"instruction": "How does 'Credit Option' handle unused units in an overage model?", "response": "The **Overage Unused Units Credit Option** determines if the customer gets financial credit for under-usage. Generally set to **NoCredit** (unused units are lost), you can technically configure it to **CreditBySpecificRate** to issue a credit back to the customer for every unit *not* used below the allowance, effectively reversing the recurring fee.", "category": "configuration", "topic": "Overage calculations"}
{"instruction": "How can I verify the 'Included Units' that were applied to a specific invoice item?", "response": "You can use the **Data Source Export** or **Data Query** tool to query the `InvoiceItem` object. Look for fields related to the charge details. For deep analysis, querying the `RatedUsage` or `ProcessedUsage` records will show the specific units applied against the tier or allowance for that billing calculation.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Overage calculations"}
{"instruction": "What is the calculation logic for 'Tiered with Overage' when usage lands in the overage zone?", "response": "The system first calculates the cost for all defined tiers (e.g., 100 units @ Tier 1 Price + 100 units @ Tier 2 Price). Then, it takes the **Total Usage** minus the **Ending Unit of the last tier**. This remainder is multiplied by the **Overage Price**. The final bill is the sum of the tier costs plus the overage cost.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Overage calculations"}
{"instruction": "Why am I seeing an error 'The ramp dates are not aligned with Valid Period dates' regarding overage?", "response": "This error often appears in **Prepaid with Drawdown** or advanced overage setups involving **Ramps**. It indicates that your Ramp Intervals (e.g., 6 months) do not align with the defined **Validity Period** or **Smoothing Interval** (e.g., Annually) of the charge. You must align the ramp segments to match the overage calculation reset periods.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Overage calculations"}
{"instruction": "What is the standard file format for importing usage data into Zuora Billing?", "response": "The standard format for importing usage data is a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file. The file must include specific header columns to map usage to the correct customer account and charge.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "Which columns are mandatory in a Zuora usage import CSV file?", "response": "The mandatory columns typically include ACCOUNT_ID, UOM (Unit of Measure), QTY (Quantity), and STARTDATE. Depending on your configuration and matching logic, SUBSCRIPTION_ID or CHARGE_ID may also be required to uniquely identify the target charge.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "How should dates be formatted in the STARTDATE and ENDDATE columns of a usage CSV?", "response": "For CSV files uploaded via the Zuora UI, the recommended date format is generally MM/DD/YYYY. If using the API, ISO 8601 format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) is often preferred to ensure locale independence.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "How do I add custom fields to a usage import file?", "response": "To include custom fields, add a column header to your CSV matching the custom field's API name. For legacy custom fields, use the field name (e.g., 'MyField'); for advanced custom fields, you must typically include the suffix (e.g., 'MyField__c').", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "What is the maximum file size for a single usage file upload?", "response": "The standard limit for a single CSV file upload via the Zuora UI is typically 4 MB. For larger datasets, it is recommended to compress the file into a ZIP archive (which can contain multiple CSVs) or split the data into smaller chunks.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "Why might I receive a 'Missing column' error even if the column exists in my CSV?", "response": "This error often occurs if the file encoding is not standard UTF-8 or if the header name does not exactly match the expected system name (e.g., using 'CallType' instead of 'CallType__c' for an advanced custom field). Saving the file as 'CSV (Comma delimited)' or 'MS-DOS Comma Separated' can often resolve encoding issues.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "What does it mean if my uploaded usage records are stuck in 'Pending' status?", "response": "'Pending' status indicates that the usage records have been successfully imported but not yet processed by a Bill Run. Usage records remain Pending until a Bill Run (with a Target Date on or after the usage end date) picks them up and rates them.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "Can I import usage data for a billing period that is already closed?", "response": "No, Zuora prevents importing usage records with a Start Date that falls within a closed accounting period. You must either re-open the accounting period (not recommended for compliance) or adjust the usage dates to an open period if appropriate.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora match a usage record to a specific subscription charge if I only provide ACCOUNT_ID?", "response": "If only ACCOUNT_ID is provided, Zuora attempts to match the usage based on the UOM (Unit of Measure). It looks for an active usage charge on that account with a matching UOM. If multiple matching charges exist, the import may fail or require more specific identifiers like SUBSCRIPTION_ID or CHARGE_ID.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "What should I do if my usage import fails with a 'Duplicate' error?", "response": "This error typically means a record with the same unique identifier (like an ImportID or a composite key of Account/Date/UOM depending on config) already exists. You should remove the duplicate records from your file or verify if the usage was already loaded previously.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "How can I correct erroneous usage data that has already been imported?", "response": "If the usage is still 'Pending', you can delete the usage records via the UI or API. If the usage has already been processed (billed), you generally need to issue a credit or import a negative usage record (contra-usage) to offset the incorrect amount in a subsequent bill run.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "Is the UOM column case-sensitive in the usage file?", "response": "Yes, the UOM (Unit of Measure) in the CSV file must exactly match the UOM configured in the Product Rate Plan Charge in Zuora. Mismatches (e.g., 'gb' vs 'GB') can cause the system to fail to find the matching charge.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "What is the correct API endpoint to upload a usage file programmatically?", "response": "You can use the `POST /v1/usage` endpoint for single-record creation or `POST /v1/usage/bulk` (often used with a file stream) to import a CSV file programmatically.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "How do I verify which records failed in a bulk usage import?", "response": "After a bulk import finishes, Zuora generates a result file (often downloadable from the UI or via a link in the API response). This file contains a row-by-row status, appending an error message column to the original data for any failed records.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "Why did my Bill Run generate a $0 invoice despite successfully uploading usage?", "response": "This often happens if the Bill Run's 'Target Date' is earlier than the end of the usage period, or if the usage charge is set to bill 'in arrears' and the current Bill Run doesn't cover the full billing cycle required to rate that usage.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Usage file formats"}
{"instruction": "What is the current status of Advanced Consumption Billing (ACB) as a product SKU?", "response": "As of early 2025, the specific 'Advanced Consumption Billing' SKU is being retired. Its core features—including Unbilled Usage, Prepaid with Drawdown, Minimum Commitment with True-Up, and Consumption Threshold Notifications—have been moved to the core Zuora Billing platform and are available out-of-the-box. Zuora Mediation remains a distinct capability that may require separate provisioning.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "How do I enable the 'Minimum Commitment' feature for a customer?", "response": "Do not attempt to enable 'Minimum Commitment' directly via a specific permission or app, as those legacy settings (e.g., 'Minimum Commitment Extension') are invalid. Instead, you must enable the 'Unbilled Usage' feature. Once Unbilled Usage is active, the Minimum Commitment capability is automatically available for the tenant.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "What steps are required to provision Zuora Mediation for a tenant?", "response": "Unlike other ACB features which are self-service, Mediation requires manual provisioning. You must create a Jira ticket for the Engineering/Mediation team (typically assigned to specific engineers like Suo or Alice) containing the Project 'Med', Type 'Task', and Summary 'Provisioning Mediation Engine'. Include the Tenant ID, Tenant Type, and URL. Once the engineering team confirms provisioning, you must enable the Mediation feature in the tenant settings.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "What is 'Prepaid with Drawdown' and how does it function?", "response": "Prepaid with Drawdown allows you to sell usage units (credits) or monetary value (cash) in advance. These prepayments are stored as a balance on the subscription. As usage events are rated, the system 'draws down' this balance. Once the balance is exhausted, subsequent usage can be charged as overage. It supports both one-time and recurring prepayment charges.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "I am receiving 4xx/5xx errors when accessing Consumption Analytics. What permissions should I check?", "response": "These errors often indicate missing permissions. Verify that the tenant has 'UsageBilling' and 'AdvancedConsumptionRating' enabled. Without these permissions, the tenant cannot access consumption analytics features. Check these settings using a tool like HawkEye or the tenant feature management console.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "What is 'Unbilled Usage' and why is it a prerequisite for other features?", "response": "Unbilled Usage allows Zuora to rate usage records continuously and store the rated amount on a specialized charge record before the bill run occurs. This provides near real-time visibility into amounts due. It is a technical prerequisite for features like Minimum Commitment and Threshold Notifications because the system needs to know the current rated value of consumption mid-cycle to trigger notifications or calculate true-ups.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "What caution should be taken when migrating an existing customer to 'Unbilled Usage'?", "response": "Enabling Unbilled Usage for an existing customer involves a data migration to create 'GuidedUsage' and 'RatingResult' records. During this migration process, avoid executing bill runs, as they may error out (e.g., failing to create billing periods). It is a best practice to schedule this enablement during a maintenance window where billing operations can be paused.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "How does 'Dynamic Usage Charges' differ from standard usage rating?", "response": "Standard usage rating requires a customer to have an active subscription with a specific usage charge (plan) to rate against. Dynamic Usage Charges allow usage to be rated and billed based on catalog list prices at the time of consumption, without requiring a pre-existing subscription to a specific usage plan. This is ideal for pure pay-as-you-go models.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "What are 'Threshold Notifications' in the context of consumption billing?", "response": "Threshold Notifications are automated alerts triggered when a customer's consumption crosses a defined percentage or amount of their prepaid balance. They are used to notify customers that their funds are running low (e.g., '80% of prepaid balance used') so they can purchase add-ons or be aware of impending overage charges.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended approach for testing 'Prepaid with Drawdown' configuration?", "response": "Use the 'Unbilled Usage' UI to verify that usage is correctly drawing down the balance before running a bill run. Ensure you have configured a prepayment charge (to fund the balance) and a drawdown usage charge (to consume it). Validate that overage charges apply correctly only after the prepaid balance is fully exhausted.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "How does the 'Mediation' rater differ from the standard Billing rating engine?", "response": "The Mediation rater operates upstream of billing, rating individual events in near real-time before they reach the billing engine. While it supports common models (Flat, Per-Unit, Tiered), it calculates on a per-record basis without full context of the billing period's aggregate volume for some models. It sends pre-rated usage to Billing, whereas the standard engine rates during the bill run or via the Unbilled Usage process.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "What should I do if the Consumption Dashboard is showing high latency or slow load times?", "response": "High latency (exceeding 5 seconds) often indicates high CPU or memory usage on the internal Consumption Server. Check if the issue coincides with the daily pipeline runtime (typically 12 AM PT for NA, 12 AM UK for EU). If persistent, it may require investigating specific events causing resource contention or checking if auto-scaling has failed to trigger.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "Can I use 'Minimum Commitment' without 'Unbilled Usage'?", "response": "No. The modern Minimum Commitment capability is architecturally dependent on the Unbilled Usage framework to track progress against the commitment in real-time. You must enable Unbilled Usage to unlock Minimum Commitment functionality.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Advanced Consumption Billing"}
{"instruction": "What is a ramp deal in the context of Zuora CPQ X?", "response": "A ramp deal is a subscription agreement structured into multiple time-based periods, known as intervals, where the products, pricing, or quantities can change over time (e.g., stepping up pricing annually). In Zuora CPQ X, you configure this by enabling the Ramp toggle in Quote Studio and defining the intervals, which allows you to make future-dated amendments within a single quote.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Ramp deals and intervals"}
{"instruction": "How do I create a new ramp deal in Zuora CPQ X Quote Studio?", "response": "To create a ramp deal in CPQ X Quote Studio: 1) Create a new Subscription Quote. 2) In the Subscription Summary section, toggle the 'Ramp' switch to 'On'. 3) Select a 'Ramp Interval Length' from the dropdown (e.g., Annual, Quarterly, or Custom). 4) Define the 'Initial Term' (must be greater than zero). 5) Add products and adjust their quantity or price for each specific interval as needed.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Ramp deals and intervals"}
{"instruction": "What configuration settings must be enabled to use Ramp Deals in Zuora CPQ?", "response": "Two primary settings are required: 1) In Zuora Billing, go to Billing Settings > Default Subscription and Order Settings and set 'Enable Ramp for Orders?' to 'Yes'. 2) In Zuora CPQ, go to Zuora Config > Quote Configuration Settings and check the box for 'Enable Ramp Metrics'. Without these, ramp functionality may not work or metrics will fail to generate.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Ramp deals and intervals"}
{"instruction": "How can I configure custom ramp intervals instead of standard annual or quarterly periods?", "response": "In Quote Studio, when creating a ramp quote, select 'Custom' from the 'Ramp Interval Length' dropdown.

{"instruction": "What is the difference between standard Price Uplift and CPI Uplift in Zuora?", "response": "Standard Price Uplift typically refers to a fixed percentage increase applied automatically upon subscription renewal (e.g., a 5% increase every year). CPI Uplift refers to a price adjustment based on a Consumer Price Index (CPI) to account for inflation, which may vary year-to-year. While standard uplift can be automated with a fixed value on the Rate Plan Charge, CPI uplift often requires updating the specific uplift percentage on the subscription before renewal based on the current index value.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Price escalation"}
{"instruction": "How do I configure a default price increase percentage for all new subscriptions of a specific product?", "response": "Navigate to the Product Catalog, select the specific Product and Rate Plan, and edit the Rate Plan Charge. Set the 'Price Increase Percentage' (or Uplift) field to the desired default value. Note that this change will only apply to *new* subscriptions created after this configuration; it does not retroactively update existing subscriptions.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Price escalation"}
{"instruction": "Why didn't my renewal apply the new price increase percentage I recently updated in the Product Catalog?", "response": "Updates to the Product Catalog (Product Rate Plan Charge) do not propagate to existing subscriptions. Existing subscriptions retain the uplift configuration they had at the time of creation. To apply a new percentage to an existing subscription, you must update the specific Subscription Rate Plan Charge directly before the renewal occurs.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Price escalation"}
{"instruction": "How can I apply a new price uplift percentage to an existing subscription for its next renewal?", "response": "You must perform an 'Update Product' order action (or amendment) on the subscription *before* the renewal action is triggered. Edit the Subscription Rate Plan Charge to update the 'Price Increase Percentage' field. When the renewal subsequently occurs (either automatically or manually), the system will use this updated percentage to calculate the new price.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Price escalation"}
{"instruction": "Can I set a new price uplift rate during the manual renewal amendment process?", "response": "No, it is not possible to set a new uplift rate as part of the renewal amendment itself. The renewal action triggers the price change based on the values already present on the subscription. You must update the subscription's rate plan charge in a separate action prior to processing the renewal.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Price escalation"}
{"instruction": "How do I define the Renewal Uplift % when creating a quote in Zuora CPQ?", "response": "In Zuora CPQ, you can define the uplift percentage in the Quote Line Editor (QLE) page. When adding or configuring products on the quote, look for the Uplift or Renewal Uplift % field on the rate plan charge line item to specify the increase that should apply upon renewal.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Price escalation"}
{"instruction": "What happens if I set a future-dated renewal with a price increase but the Contract Effective Date is incorrect?", "response": "If the Contract Effective Date for the renewal or update action does not align correctly with the term end date (e.g., it starts a day early or late), it can cause unexpected proration on the invoice. Ensure the effective date of the price increase aligns exactly with the start of the new renewal term.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Price escalation"}
{"instruction": "Does the 'Auto-Renew' flag affect how price uplifts are applied?", "response": "Yes, indirectly. If 'Auto-Renew' is set to Yes, the system automatically generates the renewal amendment using the price increase percentage already defined on the subscription. If 'Auto-Renew' is No, you must manually renew the subscription; however, the price calculation still relies on the pre-existing uplift value on the subscription unless you modify the charge beforehand.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Price escalation"}
{"instruction": "How is the new price calculated when a price uplift is applied?", "response": "The new price is calculated using the formula: New Price = Old Price * (1 + Uplift Percentage). For example, if the current price is $100 and the uplift is 3%, the new price will be $103.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Price escalation"}
{"instruction": "What should I do if I need to apply a variable CPI increase that changes every year?", "response": "Since the standard 'Price Increase Percentage' field is typically a static value, handling variable CPI often requires a manual update or a custom workflow. You would need to determine the current CPI rate and update the Subscription Rate Plan Charge with this new percentage shortly before the renewal date each year.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Price escalation"}
{"instruction": "Where can I view the details of the CPI or uplift applied to a renewal opportunity?", "response": "When a renewal opportunity is generated (e.g., in Salesforce via Zuora CPQ), details of the uplift or CPI entered in the original Quote can often be found in the 'Billing terms' or 'Info' section of the opportunity, depending on your specific field mapping and configuration.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Price escalation"}
{"instruction": "What defines a 'Ramp Deal' in the context of Zuora?", "response": "A Ramp Deal is a multi-year contract where the subscription is broken down into specific time intervals (ramps), allowing for varying pricing, quantities, or products across each interval while maintaining a single continuous subscription record.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Multi-year deals"}
{"instruction": "How do you enable a multi-year ramp deal in Zuora CPQ?", "response": "In Zuora CPQ, you configure a ramp deal by selecting the 'Ramp' option on the Quote Studio or Quote creation screen, defining the specific ramp intervals (e.g., Year 1, Year 2, Year 3), and then setting the specific quantity or price for each product within those intervals.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Multi-year deals"}
{"instruction": "Why is Zuora Revenue often required for compliant accounting of multi-year ramp deals?", "response": "Billing-Based Revenue Recognition (BBRR) typically recognizes revenue matching the invoice amount, which fluctuates in a ramp deal.

{"instruction": "What common error occurs when configuring 'Prepaid with Drawdown' charges in a CPQ ramp deal?", "response": "Users often encounter a validation error stating 'ramp dates are not aligned with Valid Period dates' if the validity period of the prepaid fund does not exactly match the start and end dates of the configured ramp interval.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Multi-year deals"}
{"instruction": "How must the Validity Period be configured for a Prepaid with Drawdown charge in a multi-year ramp?", "response": "The Validity Period of the Prepaid with Drawdown charge must be aligned to match the specific Ramp Interval length (e.g., if the ramp interval is 12 months, the validity must be 12 months) rather than spanning the entire multi-year contract, as CPQ validates that the fund expires at the end of its specific segment.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Multi-year deals"}
{"instruction": "Which Zuora API is required to create ramp deals?", "response": "The Orders API is required to create ramp deals; the legacy Subscribe API does not support the multi-interval segmentation required for ramps.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Multi-year deals"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora Billing technically structure a ramp deal on a subscription?", "response": "Zuora Billing structures a ramp deal by creating a single Subscription object with multiple 'Order Actions' (specifically Update Product order actions) that create distinct segments for each time interval, each with its own pricing or quantity configuration.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Multi-year deals"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between a Price Ramp and a Quantity Ramp?", "response": "A Price Ramp involves changing the per-unit price of a product over time (e.g., $10/unit in Year 1, $12/unit in Year 2), whereas a Quantity Ramp involves changing the number of units purchased over time (e.g., 100 licenses in Year 1, 200 licenses in Year 2) while keeping the price constant or changing it.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Multi-year deals"}
{"instruction": "Can you use the 'Subscribe' call to create a multi-year deal with varying annual pricing?", "response": "No, the legacy 'Subscribe' call cannot create a single subscription with varying pricing segments; you must use the Orders API to create a subscription with multiple segments (Ramps) to handle varying pricing over time.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Multi-year deals"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora Revenue calculate the revenue schedule for a 3-year ramp deal with increasing fees?", "response": "Zuora Revenue takes the Total Contract Value (TCV) across all 3 years and divides it by the total term length to create a straight-line revenue schedule (e.g., recognizing an equal daily amount), regardless of the lower billing amounts in Year 1.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Multi-year deals"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended approach for handling a 'migration credit' in a multi-year deal?", "response": "Instead of creating separate negative charges, best practice is to use a ramp interval for the duration of the credit (e.g., the first 3 months) and apply a discount or price reduction specifically to that first segment using the Orders/CPQ ramp functionality.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Multi-year deals"}
{"instruction": "What should you do if a ramp deal quote fails in CPQ with a 'segments do not align' error?", "response": "Check the start and end dates of your ramp intervals against the billing periods and charge validity dates; ensure that no charge definition (like a validity period) extends beyond the boundary of the ramp interval it is placed in.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Multi-year deals"}
{"instruction": "Define Total Contract Value (TCV) in the context of Zuora Billing.", "response": "Total Contract Value (TCV) represents the total committed financial value of a subscription over its fixed term.

The POB Rule Name for that line will typically become null or blank to indicate it was a manual intervention, and the line will adopt the behavior of the newly selected POB Template.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Performance obligation fundamentals"}
{"instruction": "Why might a line with a valid POB Template still show as 'Unreleased Revenue'?", "response": "A line might remain unreleased if its **Release Event** criteria have not been met (e.g., it is set to 'Upon Billing' but no invoice has been posted, or 'Upon Event' but no event has been uploaded) or if the line is on a **Revenue Hold**.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Performance obligation fundamentals"}
{"instruction": "What is the best practice for defining POB Assignment Rules?", "response": "Best practice is to use **Advanced Rules** for complex logic (e.g., bundling or multi-attribute criteria) and fall back to **Assignment by SKU** for simple, direct mappings. Ensure that a catch-all rule exists or that all SKUs are covered to prevent 'Auto POB' errors.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Performance obligation fundamentals"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora Revenue handle 'Material Rights' as a Performance Obligation?", "response": "Material Rights are treated as separate Performance Obligations. The system allocates a portion of the transaction price to the Material Right POB based on its Standalone Selling Price (SSP) and defers that revenue until the right is exercised or expires.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Performance obligation fundamentals"}
{"instruction": "Can you change the POB Template for a line after revenue has already been recognized?", "response": "Generally, changing a POB Template after revenue recognition has started is restricted or requires a retrospective adjustment (contract modification) to reverse and re-book revenue, as it changes the fundamental accounting treatment of the line.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Performance obligation fundamentals"}
{"instruction": "How is the Transaction Price for a Revenue Contract initially determined in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "The Transaction Price is initially determined by summing the 'Sell Price' (Extended Sell Price) of all transaction lines (Sales Orders, Invoices) grouped into the Revenue Contract. This typically excludes tax but includes any upfront fixed fees or committed recurring amounts.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "What component of the Revenue Contract reflects the impact of Variable Consideration (VC)?", "response": "The 'Price Adjustment' value on the Revenue Contract header reflects the impact of Variable Consideration. When a VC estimate is applied (e.g., via a formula or manual upload), Zuora Revenue calculates this adjustment and adds it to the base contract value to derive the final Transaction Price.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora Revenue handle currency exchange rates when calculating Transaction Price for a multi-currency contract?", "response": "Zuora Revenue calculates the Transaction Price using the **Line-level Functional Exchange Rate** (the rate in effect at the time of the booking/transaction). This ensures that the total contract value is fixed in the functional currency, even if subsequent revenue schedules or billings use different spot rates.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "Why might there be a variance between the 'Transaction Price' and the sum of the 'Revenue Waterfall' (Actuals + Forecast)?", "response": "A variance often occurs in multi-currency contracts because the Transaction Price is fixed at the **Line-level Functional Exchange Rate**, whereas the Waterfall (Revenue to Date + Future Revenue) is calculated using **Schedule-level Functional Exchange Rates** which fluctuate over time. Additionally, if Variable Consideration is not correctly mapped to a waterfall bucket, it may be missing from the waterfall total.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "How do you apply a Variable Consideration (e.g., a penalty or bonus) to a Revenue Contract?", "response": "You can apply Variable Consideration by defining a **VC Rule** (using a formula based on contract attributes) or by uploading a **VC Data** file that specifies the estimated adjustment amount for specific Revenue Contracts or Lines.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "What happens to the Transaction Price if a sales order line is cancelled or returned?", "response": "If a line is cancelled or returned, Zuora Revenue processes a contract modification which reduces the Transaction Price by the value of the cancelled line. Depending on the configuration, this triggers a retrospective or prospective reallocation of the remaining revenue.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "Can you manually override the Transaction Price of a specific line in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "Yes, users with appropriate permissions can manually adjust the Transaction Price or assign a specific 'Allocated Price' in the **Revenue Workbench**, typically by applying a manual price adjustment or override, though this is generally discouraged in favor of automated rules for auditability.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "How is the 'Allocated Revenue' for a performance obligation derived from the Transaction Price?", "response": "The Allocatable Transaction Price is distributed among the performance obligations based on their relative **Standalone Selling Price (SSP)**. The formula is: (Line SSP / Total Contract SSP) * Total Transaction Price.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "What role does the 'Price Modification' rule play in Transaction Price determination?", "response": "The 'Price Modification' rule defines how Zuora Revenue should react when an upstream system sends a change to the unit price or quantity of an existing line. It determines whether the change results in a cumulative catch-up (Retrospective) or affects only future periods (Prospective).", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "How are 'Material Rights' (e.g., a future discount voucher) accounted for in the Transaction Price?", "response": "A Material Right is treated as a separate performance obligation with its own SSP. A portion of the current Transaction Price is allocated to this right (deferring revenue) effectively reducing the recognized revenue for the primary goods/services in the current contract.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'Unreleased Revenue' balance composed of in relation to Transaction Price?", "response": "Unreleased Revenue represents the portion of the Transaction Price that has been allocated to performance obligations but not yet recognized (triggered) by a release event. It essentially equals: Total Transaction Price - Total Revenue Recognized To Date.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "How do you troubleshoot a scenario where the Transaction Price appears inflated after a bundle split?", "response": "Check for 'Multi-book' configuration issues or incorrect bundle explosion logic where the parent line price is not being correctly zeroed out or distributed to child lines, causing double-counting of the sell price in the Transaction Price calculation.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Transaction price determination"}
{"instruction": "What is the primary function of Step 4 (Allocate to POBs) in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "In Step 4, Zuora Revenue allocates the determined Transaction Price across the identified Performance Obligations (POBs) based on their relative Standalone Selling Prices (SSP) to ensure revenue is recognized according to fair value.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Allocation to POBs"}
{"instruction": "How is the 'Allocated Price' for a specific transaction line calculated in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "The Allocated Price is calculated using the formula: (Line SSP / Total Contract SSP) * Total Transaction Price. This distributes the total contract value proportionally based on the SSP of each line.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Allocation to POBs"}
{"instruction": "What happens if a transaction line has a 'Sell Price' that differs from its 'Allocated Price'?", "response": "If the Sell Price differs from the Allocated Price, Zuora Revenue creates an allocation adjustment. If Allocated Price < Sell Price, it is a 'Carve Out' (revenue is deferred to other lines). If Allocated Price > Sell Price, it is a 'Carve In' (revenue is pulled from other lines).", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Allocation to POBs"}
{"instruction": "How do you configure Zuora Revenue to exclude a specific line from the allocation process?", "response": "To exclude a line from allocation, set the 'Allocation Eligible' flag to 'N' (No) in the POB configuration or transaction data. This treats the line's Sell Price as its Allocated Price and excludes it from the proportional spreading calculation.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Allocation to POBs"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'Residual Method' of allocation and when is it used?", "response": "The Residual Method allocates the transaction price by first assigning SSP to known items and then allocating the remaining (residual) transaction price to items with highly variable or uncertain SSPs. It is used in limited circumstances where SSP cannot be observably established.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Allocation to POBs"}
{"instruction": "How does the 'SSP Analyzer' assist with Allocation to POBs?", "response": "The SSP Analyzer uses historical transaction data to statistically derive Standalone Selling Prices (e.g., median or weighted average) for products, helping to establish valid SSPs for accurate allocation when observable list prices are insufficient.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Allocation to POBs"}
{"instruction": "What action should you take if you encounter a 'Negative Allocation' error?", "response": "A Negative Allocation often occurs if the sum of SSPs or Transaction Prices is negative in a way that breaks the ratio formula. Check for negative line items (returns/credits) that are not properly linked to their parent lines or verify if the SSP values for those lines are correctly signed.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Allocation to POBs"}
{"instruction": "Where can you view the detailed results of the allocation calculation?", "response": "You can view the detailed results in the **Revenue Workbench** under the **Allocations** tab, which displays the Sell Price, SSP, Allocated Price, and any Carve In/Out amounts for each line in the Revenue Contract.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Allocation to POBs"}
{"instruction": "How does a 'Contract Modification' affect previously allocated revenue?", "response": "A Contract Modification triggers a re-allocation of the transaction price.

{"instruction": "What is an 'SSP Hierarchy' and how does it influence allocation?", "response": "An SSP Hierarchy is a prioritized list of methods (e.g., 1. Vendor Specific Objective Evidence, 2. Third Party Evidence, 3. Estimated Selling Price) that Zuora Revenue uses to look up and assign an SSP to a line. The system tries each method in order until a valid SSP is found.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Allocation to POBs"}
{"instruction": "How do you handle a scenario where a bundle is sold for a discount but the allocation does not reflect the discount correctly?", "response": "Verify that the **Bundle Explosion** is configured to correctly distribute the discount across child lines, or check if the **SSP** for the bundle components is set correctly. If the discount is specific to the bundle, ensure the allocation logic uses the bundle's total price against the sum of individual component SSPs.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Allocation to POBs"}
{"instruction": "What is the impact of the 'Right to Bill' flag on allocation?", "response": "The 'Right to Bill' flag generally controls billing and invoice generation but does not directly stop allocation. However, if a line is not billable and has $0 transaction price but a positive SSP, it will attract allocated revenue (Carve In) from other lines, which is a standard ASC 606 requirement for 'free' distinct goods.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Allocation to POBs"}
{"instruction": "What is the primary difference between 'Point-in-Time' (PIT) and 'Over-Time' (OT) revenue recognition in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "In Zuora Revenue, Point-in-Time (PIT) recognition releases revenue in full upon a specific trigger (e.g., Billing, Booking, or a custom Event like 'Delivery'), whereas Over-Time (OT) recognition spreads revenue ratably over a defined duration (Start Date to End Date) based on a method like Daily or Monthly amortization.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Recognition timing (point-in-time vs over time)"}
{"instruction": "How do you configure a POB Template for 'Over-Time' revenue recognition?", "response": "To configure Over-Time recognition, set the **Release Event** to 'Upon Booking' or 'Upon Billing' (depending on when the schedule should start), and set the **Ratable Method** to a time-based rule such as 'Daily' or 'Monthly'.

{"instruction": "How do you configure a POB Template for 'Point-in-Time' revenue recognition triggered by a custom event?", "response": "Set the **Release Event** in the POB Template to 'Upon Event'. You must then define the specific **Event Type** (e.g., 'Hardware Delivery') in the system. Revenue will only be released when an event record matching that type and the transaction line is uploaded or synced to Zuora Revenue.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Recognition timing (point-in-time vs over time)"}
{"instruction": "What happens if an Over-Time POB has a 'Start Date' but no 'End Date'?", "response": "If an Over-Time POB is missing a required End Date, the system cannot calculate the ratable schedule. This typically results in a validation error or the revenue being placed on hold/unreleased until the missing date is provided via a transaction update or manual correction.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Recognition timing (point-in-time vs over time)"}
{"instruction": "Can you switch a line from Over-Time to Point-in-Time recognition after revenue has started?", "response": "Switching the recognition timing method (e.g., from Ratable to Immediate) for an active line usually requires a **Contract Modification** or a retrospective adjustment. Simply changing the POB Template on a live line may not automatically re-state historical revenue without a proper modification event to trigger the accounting change.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Recognition timing (point-in-time vs over time)"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'Immediate using Open Period' ratable method?", "response": "'Immediate using Open Period' is a ratable method configuration where, if a transaction's start date is in a closed accounting period, the system catches up and recognizes all due revenue in the *current open period* rather than attempting to post to the closed historical period.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Recognition timing (point-in-time vs over time)"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora Revenue handle revenue recognition for 'Usage-Based' (Consumption) items?", "response": "Usage-Based items are typically configured with a **Release Event** of 'Upon Billing' (for billed usage) or 'Upon Event' (for rated usage data).

{"instruction": "How is 'Percentage of Completion' (POC) recognition handled in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "POC is handled by configuring a POB with a **Release Event** of 'Upon Event' (specifically a 'Percent' based event). Users upload cumulative or incremental percentage complete events, and the system releases the corresponding portion of the total allocated revenue.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Recognition timing (point-in-time vs over time)"}
{"instruction": "What is the impact of a 'Revenue Hold' on recognition timing?", "response": "A Revenue Hold overrides the standard timing configuration.

For example, Product A can use an Observable Price derived from the Analyzer, while Product B uses an Expected Cost Plus Margin formula, and Product C uses the Residual Method, provided the allocation hierarchy is set up to process them in the correct order.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "SSP determination methods (observable, expected cost, residual)"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'Compliance Range' in the context of Observable Price SSP?", "response": "The Compliance Range is a percentage band (e.g., +/- 15% of the median price) defined in the SSP setup. If a transaction's selling price falls within this range, the system considers the selling price to be the SSP (Observable). If it falls outside, the system substitutes the calculated SSP value for allocation.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "SSP determination methods (observable, expected cost, residual)"}
{"instruction": "How do you handle 'Zero Dollar' lines when using the Observable Price method?", "response": "For zero-dollar lines (e.g., free trials or bundled hardware), the Observable Price method should still assign a valid positive SSP based on the product's standalone value. This ensures that revenue is allocated to the item (Carve In) from other paid items in the contract.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "SSP determination methods (observable, expected cost, residual)"}
{"instruction": "What action is required if the 'Expected Cost' changes for a product using the Cost Plus Margin method?", "response": "If the underlying cost basis changes, you must update the **SSP Upload** data or modify the **SSP Formula** (if using a dynamic cost field) and re-process or re-allocate open contracts to reflect the new fair value for future revenue recognition.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "SSP determination methods (observable, expected cost, residual)"}
{"instruction": "What is 'Bundle Explosion' in Zuora Revenue and why is it used?", "response": "Bundle Explosion is a functionality in Zuora Revenue that automatically splits a single parent transaction line (from an upstream system like Zuora Billing) into multiple child transaction lines (components) based on a predefined configuration. This allows for separate revenue recognition, allocation, and performance obligation tracking for each component of a bundled product.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "What are the two main methods to define a Bundle structure in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "The two main methods are: 1) **Static Bundle**: The explosion happens based on a predefined parent-child relationship upload where the structure is fixed. 2) **Dynamic Bundle**: The explosion logic can be conditional or rule-based (e.g., using 'Bundle Identifier' or SKU criteria) to handle variable bundle compositions.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "What prerequisites must be met before uploading a Bundle Definition file?", "response": "Before uploading a bundle definition, you must ensure that: 1) **POB Templates** are created for all the child lines, 2) **Advanced Rules** are associated with the appropriate POB templates, and 3) the system profile `Enable_Bundle_Upload` is set to 'Yes'.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "How do you handle a 'Split Type' error during a bundle upload?", "response": "A 'Split Type' error (e.g., 'Split Type is invalid for the Parent line') often occurs if the Split Type column is populated on child lines or if the value is invalid. Ensure that 'Split Type' (e.g., 'Same', 'Percent', 'Amount') is specified *only* on the Parent line row in the upload file, and leave it blank for child lines.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "How can you remove or deactivate an existing bundle configuration that is no longer needed?", "response": "To deactivate a bundle configuration, re-upload the bundle definition file with the `Bndl Cfg Valid Until` date populated with a past date (e.g., yesterday). This effectively end-dates the bundle configuration so it will not trigger for future transactions.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "What happens if a child line in a bundle upload does not have a Start Date?", "response": "If a child line in a bundle upload does not have a Start Date specified, it typically inherits the Start Date from its Parent line. However, if a valid start date is provided for the child line in the upload file or transaction, that date will take precedence.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "How do you troubleshoot a scenario where a Bundle did not explode for a specific Revenue Contract?", "response": "Check the following: 1) Does the transaction date fall within the `Bndl Cfg Valid From` and `Valid Until` dates? 2) Do the transaction attributes (SKU, Item Num) exactly match the criteria in the bundle definition? 3) Was the bundle uploaded *before* the transaction was collected? If not, you may need to re-collect the data.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "What is the correct way to structure a Bundle Upload file when using the 'Same' Split Type for Sell and List Price?", "response": "When using `Split Type = SAME`, the Parent line row should have 'SAME' in both the `Sell Price Split Type` and `List Price Split Type` columns. The child rows should have these columns blank. This configuration copies the parent's price to each child line (or follows specific 'Same' logic defined in the system).", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "Can you define a bundle where the child lines are determined by a dynamic field like 'Term Duration'?", "response": "Yes, for dynamic scenarios (like 'Term Based' splits), you can configure the system to look at a custom field (e.g., `TermForSplit`) on the transaction line. The value in this field (e.g., '2 Years') can match a specific bundle definition criteria to trigger the appropriate split percentage for that duration.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora Revenue handle a partial return or cancellation of a bundled item?", "response": "Partial returns of bundled items can be complex. Typically, if the parent line is cancelled/returned, the system should reverse the revenue for all associated child lines proportionally. If the upstream system sends a partial return for the parent, Zuora Revenue uses the bundle split ratio to calculate the refundable amount for each child component.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "What role does the 'Parent Item Num' field play in the bundle upload file?", "response": "The `Parent Item Num` field establishes the link between the parent line and its children. In the upload file, child rows must reference the `Item Num` of their corresponding Parent row (or use a sequential structure where children immediately follow the parent) to define the hierarchy.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "Why might a 'POB Assignment' error occur after a bundle explosion?", "response": "A 'POB Assignment' error after explosion usually means the newly created child lines do not match any active **POB Assignment Rules**. Ensure that you have defined POB rules that cover the attributes (like SKU or Item Type) of the *child* lines, not just the parent.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Bundle accounting/Bundle Explosion"}
{"instruction": "What is a 'Material Right' in the context of ASC 606 and Zuora Revenue?", "response": "A Material Right is an option given to a customer to acquire additional goods or services at a price that is significantly lower than the standalone selling price (a discount) that they would not have received without entering into the original contract. It is treated as a separate Performance Obligation (POB) to which a portion of the transaction price must be allocated and deferred.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Material rights"}
{"instruction": "How do you configure a Material Right as a Performance Obligation in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "You must create a specific **POB Template** for the Material Right. This template should have a release event trigger (e.g., 'Upon Exercise' or 'Upon Expiry') and be assigned to the contract either via a specific transaction line (if the upstream system sends a placeholder SKU) or by using a **Linked POB** or **Compound POB** rule to automatically generate the material right obligation based on the parent line.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Material rights"}
{"instruction": "How is the Standalone Selling Price (SSP) determined for a Material Right?", "response": "The SSP for a Material Right is typically estimated based on the value of the future discount adjusted for the likelihood of exercise. In Zuora Revenue, this is handled by assigning an SSP value (often via **SSP Upload** or **Formula**) to the Material Right POB line so it can participate in the relative allocation of the transaction price.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Material rights"}
{"instruction": "What 'Release Event' should be used for a Material Right POB?", "response": "The Release Event should typically be **Upon Event** or **Manual**. Revenue is released when the customer exercises the right (placing the future order) or when the right expires unused. You would upload an event (e.g., 'Right Exercised' or 'Right Expired') to trigger the recognition.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Material rights"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora Revenue handle the 'Exercise' of a Material Right?", "response": "When a customer exercises the right (e.g., purchases the discounted renewal), the revenue deferred for the Material Right POB is released. This is often done by processing a **Contract Modification** or a **Revenue Event** that recognizes the deferred amount, effectively subsidizing the revenue of the new discounted purchase.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Material rights"}
{"instruction": "Can a Material Right be configured to release revenue over time?", "response": "Generally, a Material Right is a point-in-time obligation (satisfied when the right is transferred or expires). However, if the exercised right relates to a service transferred over time (like a subscription renewal), the revenue from the Material Right POB might be released and recognized over that renewal term, depending on the specific modification configuration.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Material rights"}
{"instruction": "What happens if a Material Right expires unexercised?", "response": "If the Material Right expires unexercised, the deferred revenue allocated to it should be recognized as revenue (breakage). This is executed in Zuora Revenue by uploading an expiration event or manually releasing the remaining deferred revenue on the Material Right POB.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Material rights"}
{"instruction": "How do you troubleshoot if a Material Right POB is not being created automatically?", "response": "Check the **POB Assignment Rules** or **Dependency/Linkage** configuration. Ensure that the criteria (e.g., specific SKU on the parent line) matches the rule intended to trigger the creation of the Material Right POB. Also, verify that the 'Material Right' or 'Linked POB' functionality is enabled in your tenant.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Material rights"}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to track Material Rights without a separate line item from the billing system?", "response": "Yes, Zuora Revenue can be configured to generate a 'Compound' or 'Linked' POB for the Material Right based on the presence of a qualifying parent line (e.g., a subscription with a specific renewal clause), even if the billing system does not send a discrete line item for the right itself.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Material rights"}
{"instruction": "What is the accounting entry generated when a Material Right is initially identified?", "response": "When the contract is booked, Zuora Revenue allocates a portion of the transaction price to the Material Right POB. The entry typically Debits **Unbilled Receivable** (or AR) and Credits **Deferred Revenue** (for the Material Right), reducing the immediate revenue recognized for the other items in the contract.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Material rights"}
{"instruction": "What is the primary system profile that must be enabled to use Variable Consideration in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "You must set the system profile ENABLE_VC to 'Yes' to enable Variable Consideration functionality.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Variable consideration"}
{"instruction": "How do I process Variable Consideration data after uploading a VC estimate file?", "response": "After uploading the file, navigate to Reports > Schedule Jobs and run the 'RevPro3.0 VC Process' job to process the data and apply it to the revenue contracts.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Variable consideration"}
{"instruction": "What is the most common cause of the error 'ORA-01843: not a valid month' during a VC file upload?", "response": "This error typically occurs when the date format used in your uploaded CSV file does not exactly match the 'Date Format' specified in the VC Upload Template definition (e.g., using DD-MM-YYYY in the file when the template expects DD-MON-YYYY).", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Variable consideration"}
{"instruction": "Why would Variable Consideration not calculate for a specific sales order line item while working for others?", "response": "This often happens if the 'VC Type' has not been assigned to the POB (Performance Obligation) Template associated with that specific line item.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Variable consideration"}
{"instruction": "How can I prevent VC upload files from being blocked due to special characters like '=' or '+'?", "response": "You can adjust the 'ENABLE_CSV_DATA_SANITIZATION' profile settings. If set to 'BLOCK', files with these characters are rejected; changing it to 'SANITIZE' or 'RAW' may allow processing, though 'SANITIZE' is recommended for security.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Variable consideration"}
{"instruction": "What are the two primary methods for establishing Variable Consideration estimates in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "VC estimates can be established automatically via 'System Applied VC' rules when sales order lines are collected, or manually by uploading VC estimates and actuals via CSV files.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Variable consideration"}
{"instruction": "Where within the Revenue Workbench can I view Variable Consideration data?", "response": "Variable Consideration data is visible in the Overview, Contract/Order, Waterfall, and Revenue Summary tabs within the Revenue Workbench.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Variable consideration"}
{"instruction": "What could cause a Variable Consideration amount to appear as a negative value?", "response": "A negative VC amount can result if the underlying Extended Selling Price (ESP) for the line is negative, or if the VC formula is configured to produce a negative result (e.g., a penalty or deduction calculation).", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Variable consideration"}
{"instruction": "What mandatory setups are required before Variable Consideration can be calculated?", "response": "Mandatory setups include enabling the ENABLE_VC profile, configuring VC-related accounts, defining VC policies, and assigning VC Types to POB Templates.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Variable consideration"}
{"instruction": "What does the error 'No VC data to process' indicate after running the process job?", "response": "This error indicates that although the job was triggered, no valid staged data was found to process, often due to a failure during the initial file upload step or a template mapping mismatch.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Variable consideration"}
{"instruction": "How do I ensure my VC upload file date format is accepted by the system?", "response": "Check the 'Date Format' field in your VC Template setup in Zuora Revenue and ensure every date in your CSV upload file follows that exact pattern (e.g., 01-JAN-2025).", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Variable consideration"}
{"instruction": "Can Zuora Revenue handle Variable Consideration actuals in addition to estimates?", "response": "Yes, Zuora Revenue allows you to upload and track VC actuals, which can then update the estimates, clear previous accruals, or cancel final actuals based on the file data.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Variable consideration"}

{"instruction": "What constitutes a 'Contract Modification' in Zuora Revenue, and how is it triggered?", "response": "A Contract Modification in Zuora Revenue occurs when there is a change to an existing Revenue Contract (RC) after its initial creation period has passed. It is triggered when new transaction lines (such as subscription amendments, sales order updates, or new orders) are collected and grouped into an existing RC based on the configured grouping rules. These changes can include updates to price, quantity, terms, or the addition/removal of Performance Obligations (POBs).", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Contract Management - Contract creation and modification"}
{"instruction": "Explain the difference between 'Retrospective' and 'Prospective' allocation treatments for contract modifications.", "response": "Retrospective allocation treats the contract modification as if it were part of the original contract from inception, causing the system to recalculate the Total Contract Value (TCV) and reallocation of revenue across all lines from the beginning, often resulting in catch-up or backing-out of revenue. Prospective allocation treats the modification as a new event, where the remaining unrecognized revenue and any new revenue are allocated over the remaining term, leaving previously recognized revenue unchanged.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Contract Management - Contract creation and modification"}
{"instruction": "How do I configure the system to prevent specific changes from triggering a contract modification reallocation?", "response": "You can use the 'Skip Contract Modification' rule functionality. In the Policies > Contract Modification settings, you can define rules based on specific criteria (such as a specific transaction type or field value). When these criteria are met, the system will set the SKIP_CT_MOD_FLAG to 'Y' for those lines, effectively ignoring them for reallocation purposes and treating them according to the default behavior defined (usually keeping existing allocations intact).", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Contract Management - Contract creation and modification"}
{"instruction": "What is the consequence of manually delinking a transaction line from a Revenue Contract (RC) in the Workbench?", "response": "Manually delinking a line from a Revenue Contract stops the system from applying automatic grouping rules to that specific RC in the future. Once a manual 'Delink' action is performed, the RC is flagged as manually modified, and subsequent lines that would normally group to this RC based on the grouping template may instead create a new, separate Revenue Contract to preserve the integrity of the manual intervention.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Contract Management - Contract creation and modification"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora Revenue distinguish between a 'correction' to a contract and a 'contract modification'?", "response": "This is determined by the 'Contract Modification Timeline' configuration. You define an 'Initial Period' (e.g., RC Creation Period + X periods). Changes received within this Initial Period are treated as data corrections (Allocation adjustments) rather than formal Contract Modifications. Changes received after this timeline enters the 'Revision Period' are treated as formal Contract Modifications that trigger the prospective or retrospective accounting rules.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Contract Management - Contract creation and modification"}
{"instruction": "I collected an amendment line, but it did not trigger a Contract Modification in the Workbench. What should I check?", "response": "First, verify the 'Contract Modification Timeline' settings to ensure the amendment falls within the 'Revision Period' and not the 'Initial Period'. Second, check if the amendment line grouped successfully into the target RC; if it created a new RC due to grouping failures, it won't trigger a mod on the old one.

{"instruction": "What happens if a contract modification results in a negative reallocation that cannot be absorbed by the remaining deferred revenue?", "response": "This scenario typically triggers 'Contract Impairment'. Zuora Revenue can be configured to handle impairment by creating specific impairment POBs or adjusting the revenue entries based on the configured Impairment Type (Type 1 through Type 5). This ensures that the negative revenue is recognized immediately or amortized correctly according to the accounting policy defined for loss contracts.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Contract Management - Contract creation and modification"}
{"instruction": "Can I switch the allocation treatment of a contract modification from Prospective to Retrospective after it has been processed?", "response": "Yes, you can manually override the treatment in the Revenue Workbench. Locate the specific modification event in the 'Allocation' or 'Contract Modification' screen, unlock/unfreeze the contract if necessary, and change the allocation method. You must then save and trigger a reallocation (process the contract) for the system to recalculate the revenue schedules based on the new method.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Contract Management - Contract creation and modification"}
{"instruction": "Why would I use the 'Freeze' function on a Revenue Contract?", "response": "Freezing a Revenue Contract prevents any further system processing, allocation changes, or revenue release updates from occurring on that contract. This is useful during audit periods, when investigating data issues, or when a contract requires a static state while upstream corrections are being made. You must manually 'Unfreeze' the contract to resume normal processing.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Contract Management - Contract creation and modification"}
{"instruction": "What is the impact of the 'ENABLE_RETRO_PROSPECTIVE' profile setting?", "response": "This system-level profile determines how Zuora Revenue behaves when multiple amendments with conflicting treatment rules (e.g., one triggering Prospective and another triggering Retrospective) occur within the same revision timeline. If set to 'NO', the system typically enforces a Retrospective treatment for the entire batch of changes to ensure consistency.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Contract Management - Contract creation and modification"}
{"instruction": "How do I move a transaction line from one Revenue Contract to another?", "response": "In the Revenue Workbench, select the source Revenue Contract, go to the 'Manage Lines' or 'Lines' tab, select the specific transaction line, and choose the 'Delink' option.

{"instruction": "Why did a new Sales Order create a separate Revenue Contract instead of combining with the existing one as expected?", "response": "This typically happens if: 1) The new line's data does not strictly match the **Grouping Attributes** of the existing contract (e.g., different Currency or Organization), 2) The existing Revenue Contract is in a **Closed** or **Finalized** status, or 3) The **RC Creation Period** (or 'Look back period') defined in the system settings has elapsed, preventing new lines from joining old contracts.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Contract combination"}
{"instruction": "What happens when I combine a new transaction line into an existing Revenue Contract that has already recognized revenue?", "response": "This triggers a **Contract Modification**. Zuora Revenue will re-evaluate the Total Contract Value (TCV) and, based on your **Contract Modification Rules** (e.g., Prospective or Retrospective allocation), will either reallocate revenue across all lines (Retrospective) or allocate the new value over the remaining term (Prospective).", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Contract combination"}
{"instruction": "How can I prevent specific transaction lines from ever being automatically combined into a Revenue Contract?", "response": "You can use the **Manual Link/Delink** functionality.

Transactions arriving after this window will trigger the creation of a new, separate Revenue Contract.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Contract combination"}
{"instruction": "Can I combine Revenue Contracts that belong to different currencies?", "response": "Generally, no. **Currency** is a hard constraint for Revenue Contract grouping in Zuora Revenue. All transaction lines within a single Revenue Contract must share the same transactional currency to ensure accurate SSP allocation and revenue recognition. Multi-currency grouping typically requires custom currency conversion logic upstream before data ingestion.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Contract combination"}
{"instruction": "How do I identify which Revenue Contracts have been manually combined or modified?", "response": "In the **Revenue Workbench**, you can view the **History** or **Audit Trail** tab for a specific Revenue Contract.

{"instruction": "What is the primary function of a contract amendment in Zuora?", "response": "In Zuora, an amendment is a transaction that modifies an existing active subscription. When an amendment is created, it generates a new version of the subscription while preserving the history of previous versions. Amendments are used to handle lifecycle changes such as adding products, removing products, changing terms, or updating pricing without canceling the original contract.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Contract amendments"}
{"instruction": "List the standard amendment types available in Zuora and their specific purposes.", "response": "The standard amendment types include: 'NewProduct' (to add a product), 'RemoveProduct' (to remove an existing product), 'UpdateProduct' (to change price or quantity of an existing product), 'TermsAndConditions' (to change the contract term or renewal settings), 'Renewal' (to renew a subscription), 'OwnerTransfer' (to change the invoice or subscription owner), 'SuspendSubscription', 'ResumeSubscription', and 'Cancellation'.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Contract amendments"}
{"instruction": "Explain the relationship between an amendment and a subscription version.", "response": "Every time an amendment is successfully created, Zuora increments the subscription version number. The amendment applies changes effective from a specific date, creating a new subscription version that reflects the state of the contract from that date forward. The previous version remains as a historical record of the subscription prior to the change.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Contract amendments"}
{"instruction": "How do I remove a product from an active subscription using the API?", "response": "To remove a product via the API, use the 'amend()' call with an amendment object where the 'Type' is set to 'RemoveProduct'. You must specify the 'SubscriptionId', the 'ContractEffectiveDate' for the removal, and the 'RatePlanId' of the product you wish to remove in the 'RatePlanData' object. Zuora will handle the proration and credits based on your billing rules.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Contract amendments"}
{"instruction": "What steps should I follow to update the quantity or price of a product on a subscription?", "response": "To update a product, create an amendment of type 'UpdateProduct'. In the amendment details, identify the specific 'RatePlanId' and 'RatePlanChargeId' you want to modify. Enter the new quantity or price in the 'RatePlanChargeData' object. Ensure you set the 'ContractEffectiveDate' to the date the change should take effect.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Contract amendments"}
{"instruction": "How can I preview the invoice impact of an amendment before finalizing it?", "response": "When using the 'amend()' API call, you can set the 'PreviewOptions' parameter. specifically, set 'PreviewMode' to 'true'. This will return a response containing the expected invoice items and amounts that would be generated by the amendment without actually committing the changes to the database.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Contract amendments"}
{"instruction": "I am receiving an 'INVALID_VALUE' error regarding null SRP fields when using Data Loader for amendments. How do I fix this?", "response": "This error often occurs because the Data Loader has strict validation requirements for 'NewProduct' and 'RemoveProduct' amendments. Ensure that for a 'NewProduct' amendment, you provide the 'New Rate Plan Id' and associated charge data, leaving 'Removed Rate Plan Id' null. Conversely, for 'RemoveProduct', ensure 'Removed Rate Plan Id' is populated. If issues persist, it is recommended to use the Developer Tools (API Loader) or the 'amend()' API directly, as they handle these validations more gracefully.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Contract amendments"}
{"instruction": "What does the error 'The Contract effective date should not be earlier than the customer acceptance date of the basic subscription' mean?", "response": "This error occurs when you attempt to create an amendment with a 'ContractEffectiveDate' that predates the 'CustomerAcceptanceDate' (or 'ServiceActivationDate') of the original subscription or the previous amendment. In Zuora, amendments must follow a chronological order relative to the subscription's anchor dates. You must adjust the amendment's effective date to be on or after the acceptance date of the current active version.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Contract amendments"}
{"instruction": "Why are my changes not reflecting on the latest subscription version after I successfully created a 'Completed' amendment?", "response": "If an amendment is created with a future effective date, the changes will not appear on the currently active version of the subscription until that date is reached. However, a new future-dated version of the subscription should exist. Verify you are querying for 'version=latest' or checking the future-dated version in the UI.

{"instruction": "What is the recommended best practice for handling subscriptions with a high number of amendments (e.g., over 1000 versions)?", "response": "Having a very large number of amendments (versions) on a single subscription can cause performance degradation in the UI and API. As a best practice, if a subscription approaches 1,000 versions, you should consider canceling the existing subscription and creating a new one (often called a 'replacement' subscription) to reset the version count and maintain system performance.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Contract amendments"}
{"instruction": "When should I use the 'TermsAndConditions' amendment type versus a 'Renewal' amendment?", "response": "Use 'TermsAndConditions' when you need to extend the term length of a contract mid-cycle, change the 'AutoRenew' setting, or update other non-product fields like 'TermType'.

{"instruction": "What is the difference between 'Carve-in' and 'Carve-out' in Zuora Revenue allocations?", "response": "In Zuora Revenue (RevPro), a 'Carve-out' occurs when a transaction line's selling price is higher than its allocated revenue (based on SSP), meaning revenue is 'carved out' from this line to be reallocated to other lines. Conversely, a 'Carve-in' happens when a line's selling price is lower than its allocated revenue, so it receives revenue 'carved in' from other lines in the revenue contract to meet its relative SSP value.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Carve-in and carve-out"}
{"instruction": "How do I configure Zuora Revenue to perform a carve-out for a specific performance obligation (POB)?", "response": "To configure a carve-out for a POB, you must define the Standalone Selling Price (SSP) for the item. Zuora Revenue automatically calculates the transaction price allocation based on the SSP hierarchy. If the line item's transaction price exceeds its relative SSP, the system will automatically carve out the excess revenue and reallocate it to other lines in the Revenue Contract (RC) that are below their SSP.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Carve-in and carve-out"}
{"instruction": "Why is my 'Carve-out' adjustment not calculating even though I uploaded a Sales Order with a price within the SSP range?", "response": "If the SSP Hierarchy setup in the RC Grouping Template has the 'SP Within Range' option set to 'Selling Price', the system uses the selling price as the SSP, resulting in no allocation adjustment (zero carve-in/carve-out). To enable carve-outs, change the 'SP Within Range' setting to 'Midpoint', 'Above Midpoint', 'Below Midpoint', or 'List Price' so the system has a distinct value to allocate against.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Carve-in and carve-out"}
{"instruction": "What does the error 'Transfer Validation Failed! Mismatch in CarveOut amount!' mean during the Transfer Accounting process?", "response": "This error (RPRO-00675) indicates that the carve-in and carve-out entries (adjustment liability entries) within a Revenue Contract do not net to zero for the current period. This often happens due to rounding issues, incomplete data processing, or manual manipulation of allocation eligible flags. The system places a transfer hold on the affected RC until the imbalance is resolved.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Carve-in and carve-out"}
{"instruction": "How can I report on the total carve-in and carve-out amounts for a specific accounting period?", "response": "You can use the 'Waterfall Report' in Zuora Revenue. Select the Waterfall Type as 'Adjustments' for the current period snapshot. This will display the carve-in and carve-out amounts (Allocation Revenue) amortized for that period. Alternatively, you can use the RC Rollforward report with a layout configured to show allocation releases.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Carve-in and carve-out"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended best practice for handling 'Carve-out' tax in Zuora Billing?", "response": "In Zuora Billing, 'Carve-out' typically refers to 'Tax Inclusive' pricing, where tax is extracted from the total charge amount. The best practice is to set the tax mode to 'Tax Inclusive' at the product rate plan charge level or the tenant level. Ensure that your tax codes (e.g., Avalara or Zuora Tax) are associated with the charge so the system can correctly calculate the net revenue by carving out the tax amount.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Carve-in and carve-out"}
{"instruction": "Can I manually edit the Carve-in and Carve-out values in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "Yes, you can manually edit Carve Adjustment Amounts using the 'Edit Line' option in the Workbench. However, this is generally not recommended because manual edits freeze the allocation for that line. Future changes to the Revenue Contract (such as SO updates or credit memos) will not trigger prospective or retrospective re-allocation for that frozen line, potentially leading to compliance issues.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Carve-in and carve-out"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora handle a scenario where a 'Carve-out' line is cancelled in a subsequent period?", "response": "When a line that contributed a carve-out is cancelled, Zuora Revenue triggers a modification (Prospective or Retrospective depending on configuration). The system should reverse the previous carve-out allocation. If the allocation does not rebalance correctly (e.g., netting to zero), you may need to check if the 'Impairment' functionality is triggered or if the line requires a manual 'Unfreeze' and 'Re-allocate' action in the Workbench.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Carve-in and carve-out"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between 'Tax Inclusive' (Carve-out) and 'Tax Exclusive' modes in Zuora Billing?", "response": "'Tax Inclusive' means the price quoted to the customer includes the tax; Zuora calculates the tax by 'carving it out' from the total price (e.g., Price $110, Tax Rate 10% -> Revenue $100, Tax $10). 'Tax Exclusive' means the tax is added on top of the quoted price (e.g., Price $100, Tax Rate 10% -> Total $110, Revenue $100, Tax $10).", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Carve-in and carve-out"}
{"instruction": "How do I resolve a 'Mismatch in CarveOut amount' error if re-allocation does not fix it?", "response": "If standard re-allocation in the Workbench does not resolve the mismatch, try switching the allocation type from 'Prospective' to 'Retrospective' (or vice versa) and then re-allocate. This forces the system to recalculate the cumulative allocation from inception, often clearing rounding differences or stuck entries. If the issue persists, a data fix might be required to adjust the 'adjustment liability' entries directly.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Carve-in and carve-out"}
{"instruction": "What is the primary purpose of the Revenue Waterfall Report in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "The Revenue Waterfall Report displays the distribution of revenue across periods, including prior, current, and future schedules. It is primarily used to forecast revenue for unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations (POBs), allowing finance teams to visualize how deferred revenue and unbilled revenue will be recognized over time.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Revenue waterfall"}
{"instruction": "How can I identify which Revenue Contracts (RCs) are causing a discrepancy in the deferred revenue balance using the Waterfall Report?", "response": "To identify discrepancies, validate the deferred balance by ensuring that all future revenue from the Waterfall report run period (excluding the current period) plus 'F-Alloc. Unscheduled Revenue' and 'F-Unscheduled Revenue' are included. Compare your manual deferred balance calculation against the system's 'F-Total DREV Ending Balance'. Discrepancies often point to specific RCs where the waterfall may not have generated correctly or where manual adjustments (MJEs) were excluded.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Revenue waterfall"}
{"instruction": "Explain the difference between the 'Waterfall Report' and the 'Historical Waterfall Report' in Zuora Revenue.", "response": "The standard 'Waterfall Report' provides a snapshot of revenue distribution for the prior period, current period, and future schedules based on the current system state. In contrast, the 'Historical Waterfall Report' allows you to review period-wise breakdowns of actual revenue activity for up to 13 historical periods from any chosen past period, making it useful for trend analysis and historical audits.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Revenue waterfall"}
{"instruction": "Why might fully amortized Revenue Contracts (RCs) still appear on my Revenue Waterfall Report?", "response": "This was a known issue in older versions of Zuora Revenue where RCs with 100% recognized revenue would still populate the report with zero future values. This has been addressed in recent releases (e.g., 2025.Q3 and 2025.Q1.1.0). You can now run the 'RC Scanning Program Master' job manually to flag and exclude these 'extinct' RCs from the Waterfall Report to clean up the data.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Revenue waterfall"}
{"instruction": "What steps should I take if the 'Net Revenue' in my Waterfall Report does not tie to the General Ledger (GL) balance?", "response": "First, verify if the report includes Manual Journal Entries (MJEs), as standard LTST (Long Term Short Term) waterfall reports may exclude them. Second, check for 'zero dollar lines' or fully amortized contracts that might clutter the report. Third, ensure that the 'Current Period Net Revenue' in the waterfall matches the total revenue activity in your GL for the same period. Finally, review any recent contract modifications or date changes that might have caused a 'pullback' or negative revenue adjustment in the current period.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Revenue waterfall"}
{"instruction": "How do I configure the Revenue Waterfall Report to view future revenue schedules for specific liability accounts?", "response": "While the standard Waterfall Report is RC-centric, you can filter or configure it to show revenue schedules by GL account if your report layout supports it. Alternatively, use the 'Unsatisfied POB Report (RPO)' to view future waterfalls broken down by month, quarter, or year. For detailed liability account investigation, the 'Details Report' or 'Account Analysis' tab in the Close Process Dashboard is recommended to trace specific debits and credits.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Revenue waterfall"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'Billing Waterfall' report and how does it differ from the standard Revenue Waterfall?", "response": "The 'Billing Waterfall' report displays revenue waterfall data specifically for *billed* contractual revenue, rolling out contract liability balances at the invoice line level.

{"instruction": "I see negative values in the current period of my Revenue Waterfall Report for an RC. Is this expected?", "response": "Negative values in the current period can be expected if there was a 'Revenue Pullback' or a contract modification (e.g., term reduction, cancellation, or reduction order) that reversed previously recognized revenue. This adjustment ensures the cumulative revenue recognized matches the new contract terms. Verify if a Retrospective allocation change occurred or if a Reduction Order (RORD) was processed.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Revenue waterfall"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended best practice for handling 'zero dollar lines' in the Revenue Waterfall Report?", "response": "Best practice is to ensure your Zuora Revenue instance is updated to a version that supports the suppression of zero-dollar lines (e.g., post-37.018.05). Regularly run the 'RC Scanning Program Master' job to flag fully amortized or zero-balance RCs as 'extinct' so they are automatically excluded from the report, improving performance and readability.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Revenue waterfall"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora Revenue handle foreign exchange (FX) in waterfall reporting?", "response": "Zuora Revenue provides a specific 'Period FX Waterfall' report.

{"instruction": "Can I use the Waterfall Report to validate my Deferred Revenue balance for audit purposes?", "response": "Yes, but with caution. The calculated deferred revenue from the Waterfall Report (Sum of Future Net Revenue - Sum of Future Unbilled Revenue) should theoretically match your Deferred Revenue balance. However, discrepancies can arise due to manual adjustments, rounding, or data sync issues. For strict audit tie-outs, it is recommended to use the 'RC Rollforward Report' or 'Accounting Report' alongside the Waterfall Report for reconciliation.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Revenue waterfall"}
{"instruction": "What is the primary difference between 'Unbilled AR' and 'Deferred Revenue' in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "In Zuora Revenue (RevPro), 'Unbilled AR' (or Contract Asset) represents revenue that has been recognized but not yet billed to the customer (Revenue > Billing). 'Deferred Revenue' (or Contract Liability) represents amounts that have been billed to the customer but not yet recognized as revenue (Billing > Revenue). The system automatically tracks these balances at the performance obligation (POB) or line level.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Unbilled AR vs Deferred Revenue"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora Revenue determine whether to post to Unbilled AR or Contract Asset?", "response": "Zuora Revenue uses the 'Right To Bill' (RTB) flag to distinguish between Unbilled AR and Contract Asset. If Revenue > Billing and the RTB flag is 'Y' (True), the system debits the 'Unbilled Receivables' account. If Revenue > Billing and the RTB flag is 'N' (False), it debits the 'Contract Asset' account. This distinction ensures compliance with accounting standards regarding conditional vs. unconditional rights to payment.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Unbilled AR vs Deferred Revenue"}
{"instruction": "Explain the 'Netting Process' for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities in Zuora Revenue.", "response": "The Netting Process in Zuora Revenue is a period-end activity that reclassifies contract balances to present a true net position for each revenue contract. It offsets (nets) Contract Asset and Contract Liability balances against each other to report a single net 'Contract Asset' or 'Contract Liability' position for the contract. This typically involves topside journal entries to reclassify amounts between the asset and liability accounts for financial reporting.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Unbilled AR vs Deferred Revenue"}
{"instruction": "What reports should I use to reconcile Unbilled AR and Deferred Revenue balances?", "response": "To reconcile these balances, use the 'Unbill Rollforward Report' and the 'RC Rollforward Report' (or 'Accounting Report'). The Unbilled Rollforward Report tracks the beginning balance, additions (new unbilled revenue), releases (billed revenue), and ending balance for Unbilled AR. The RC Rollforward Report provides a comprehensive view of total contract value, billings, and revenue, helping to validate the deferred revenue (contract liability) position.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Unbilled AR vs Deferred Revenue"}
{"instruction": "I am seeing negative balances in my Unbilled Rollforward Report. What could be the cause?", "response": "Negative ending balances in the Unbilled Rollforward Report are often due to discrepancies in the 'Right To Bill' flag or timing issues between billing and revenue recognition. For example, if a line was previously flagged as Unbilled AR (RTB=Y) but later billed or reclassified incorrectly, it might not clear the balance properly.

{"instruction": "How do I configure the accounting codes for Unbilled AR and Deferred Revenue in Zuora Billing for Order-to-Revenue?", "response": "In Zuora Billing, you must map the specific revenue GL accounts within the Product Rate Plan Charge. For the 'Order-to-Revenue' integration, ensure you populate the 'Deferred Revenue Account' (Contract Liability) and 'Recognized Revenue Account' fields. While Billing handles the invoice-side accounting (Dr AR, Cr Deferred), Zuora Revenue handles the revenue-side accounting (Dr Deferred/Unbilled, Cr Revenue) based on these mappings synced via the product catalog.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Unbilled AR vs Deferred Revenue"}
{"instruction": "What happens to the Unbilled AR balance when an invoice is finally generated?", "response": "When an invoice is generated for a previously unbilled amount, Zuora Revenue reverses the original Unbilled AR (or Contract Asset) entry. The system credits the Unbilled AR/Contract Asset account and debits the Deferred Revenue (Contract Liability) account. This clears the unbilled position and moves the balance to deferred revenue, which is then drawn down as revenue is recognized.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Unbilled AR vs Deferred Revenue"}
{"instruction": "Why does my 'Waterfall Report' deferred revenue balance not match my General Ledger?", "response": "Discrepancies between the Waterfall Report (which projects future revenue) and the GL Deferred Revenue balance can occur if 'Unbilled' amounts are not excluded from the waterfall calculation. The true Deferred Revenue balance is typically calculated as: (Sum of All Future Net Revenue in Waterfall) - (Sum of All Future Unbilled Revenue). Ensure you are subtracting the unbilled portion from the total future revenue to derive the correct contract liability balance.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Unbilled AR vs Deferred Revenue"}
{"instruction": "Can I manually adjust Unbilled AR or Deferred Revenue balances in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "Yes, you can use Manual Journal Entries (MJEs) to adjust balances, but this should be done with caution. If you identify a discrepancy that cannot be resolved through standard processing (e.g., due to a data issue or conversion error), you can book an MJE to correct the GL balance.

{"instruction": "Why is my revenue not spreading evenly across months for a 'Monthly recognition over time' rule?", "response": "The 'Monthly recognition over time' rule generally requires a service period of 3 months or more to function as expected. If the service period is less than 3 months, the system may default to 'Daily recognition over time', which calculates revenue based on the exact number of days in each month (e.g., 28 days in Feb vs. 31 in Jan), resulting in uneven monthly amounts.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Recognition Patterns - Straight-line recognition"}
{"instruction": "How does Zuora Revenue handle 'Partial Month' calculations for straight-line recognition?", "response": "For service periods that do not align perfectly with calendar months (e.g., Feb 25 to Mar 24), Zuora Revenue calculates revenue based on the number of active days in each period.

{"instruction": "Can I use 'Hours-Based' release as a form of POC recognition?", "response": "Yes, 'Hours-Based Release' is a common implementation of POC. Revenue is released progressively based on the number of hours logged (e.g., in a PSA system like Jira) against the total estimated hours.

{"instruction": "What is the difference between 'Ratable' and 'POC' revenue recognition?", "response": "'Ratable' recognition spreads revenue evenly over time (e.g., daily or monthly) based strictly on start and end dates. 'POC' (Percent of Completion) recognizes revenue based on the actual progress or performance of the obligation, which may be uneven or irregular over the contract term, depending on when work is completed.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Recognition Patterns - Percent of completion (POC)"}
{"instruction": "How should I handle a change in the 'Total Estimated Effort' for a POC project?", "response": "If the total estimated effort (denominator) changes, you should update the project's total expected quantity or value in Zuora Revenue. The system will then recalculate the completion percentage (Actual / New Total) and post a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the current period to correct the revenue recognized to date based on the new estimate.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Recognition Patterns - Percent of completion (POC)"}
{"instruction": "Is it possible to automate POC revenue recognition from an external project management system?", "response": "Yes, you can automate this by integrating your project management system (e.g., Jira, Mavenlink) with Zuora Revenue.

{"instruction": "Why is my milestone revenue being distributed over time instead of recognized immediately upon the event?", "response": "If milestone revenue is distributing over time, check the 'Start Date' and 'End Date' in your uploaded event file. If you provide a date range (e.g., Start: Jan 1, End: Jan 31) in the event upload, Zuora Revenue may amortize the released amount over that period. For immediate recognition, ensure the Start Date and End Date are the same (e.g., the milestone completion date).

{"instruction": "How can I recognize partial revenue for a milestone (e.g., 50% upon completion of Phase 1)?", "response": "You can recognize partial revenue by uploading an event with a partial quantity or percentage. For example, if the total POB quantity is 1, you can upload an event with a quantity of 0.5 (or 50%) to release half the revenue.

{"instruction": "How do I reverse a milestone revenue release if it was triggered in error?", "response": "To reverse a release, you typically upload a 'negative' event or a correction event. For example, if you released 100% revenue by mistake, you can upload a new event with a quantity of -1 (or 0% cumulative, depending on configuration) for the same date or period. This will reverse the recognized revenue and place it back into deferred revenue.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Recognition Patterns - Milestone-based recognition"}
{"instruction": "What is the best practice for 'Professional Services' milestone recognition?", "response": "For Professional Services, it is best practice to keep the revenue recognition separate from billing.

{"instruction": "How do I configure a product charge to use 'As-invoiced recognition' in Zuora Billing for downstream Revenue processing?", "response": "To configure 'As-invoiced recognition', navigate to the Product Catalog in Zuora Billing. Select the Product Rate Plan Charge and set the 'Revenue Recognition Rule' to 'Recognize upon invoicing' (or a custom rule based on the 'Upon Billing' model). Additionally, ensure the 'Revenue Recognition Timing' is set to 'Upon Billing Document Posting Date' or similar, and 'Revenue Amortization Method' is set to 'Immediate'.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Recognition Patterns - As-invoiced recognition"}
{"instruction": "What happens if I set the 'Recognize revenue without deferral' option to 'Yes' for an as-invoiced charge?", "response": "When 'Recognize revenue without deferral' is enabled for a charge using the 'Recognize upon invoicing' rule, Zuora will essentially mirror the Recognized Revenue account into the Deferred Revenue account field in the UI. This configuration often results in the debit (Deferred) and credit (Revenue) accounting codes being identical, which causes them to offset each other, meaning no net journal entry is created for the deferral-to-revenue movement because it happens instantaneously.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Recognition Patterns - As-invoiced recognition"}
{"instruction": "Why are my 'Recognize upon invoicing' charges not generating journal entries in the Journal Run?", "response": "If your charges are set to 'Recognize upon invoicing' and you see no journal entries, it is likely because the 'Deferred Revenue' accounting code and 'Recognized Revenue' accounting code are configured to be the same (often due to the 'Recognize revenue without deferral' setting). When the debit and credit accounts are identical, the system suppresses the journal entry as it has a net zero impact on the GL. Verify your accounting code setup for that charge.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Recognition Patterns - As-invoiced recognition"}
{"instruction": "Can I use 'As-invoiced recognition' for a subscription charge that spans multiple months?", "response": "Technically, yes, you can apply the 'Recognize upon invoicing' rule to any charge. However, doing so for a multi-month subscription violates standard accrual accounting principles (like ASC 606), as revenue would be recognized fully upfront rather than ratably over the service period.

{"instruction": "How should I handle withholding tax adjustments for as-invoiced revenue?", "response": "Zuora's standard revenue recognition is based on the transaction amount (sell price). If you need to recognize revenue net of withholding tax (e.g., Invoice $100, WHT $20, Revenue $80), this is not standard behavior. You would typically need to book the full $100 as revenue and handle the tax withheld as a separate accounting entry (e.g., via a Credit Memo or manual journal) or use a custom revenue rule if the net amount must be the recognized basis.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Recognition Patterns - As-invoiced recognition"}
{"instruction": "Why does my invoice date not align with the revenue recognition date for an 'As-invoiced' charge?", "response": "In Zuora Revenue, the revenue schedule date is driven by the 'Revenue Schedule Date' logic, which usually defaults to the invoice date for billing-based rules.

You must ensure your custom rules are correctly defined to handle the recognition logic or manually intervene if a standard schedule is expected.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Revenue Schedules"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'Transfer Accounting' process in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "Transfer Accounting is the process of collecting posted journal entries from the Zuora Revenue sub-ledger and transmitting them to your general ledger (GL) or ERP system (such as SAP, Oracle, or Workday). This process groups entries into batches, validates them against accounting rules, and can summarize lines based on your configuration before generating the outbound file or triggering the connector.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Journal entries"}
{"instruction": "How can I map Manual Journal Entry (MJE) reference columns to appear in Accounting Reports like the Waterfall or Rollforward?", "response": "To map MJE reference columns (e.g., Reference1, Reference2) to standard accounting reports, you must configure the 'MJE_RC_LINE_FIELD_MAP' lookup. Navigate to the Lookup definition, edit 'MJE_RC_LINE_FIELD_MAP', and add rows to map the MJE column (from the 'RPRO_JE_LINE_G' table) to the corresponding Revenue Contract line column (in 'RPRO_RC_LINE_G'). After configuration, upload the MJE file, approve the batch, and run the summarization program to see the data in reports.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Journal entries"}
{"instruction": "What does it mean if a Transfer Accounting batch status remains 'Ready to Transfer' after the connector execution?", "response": "If a batch remains in 'Ready to Transfer' status even after the GL connector (e.g., Workday, Netsuite) has executed, it typically indicates that the connector encountered an error or failed to receive a successful acknowledgment from the target system. You should check the connector logs for specific error messages, such as 'Invalid ID value' or authentication failures. The status will only change to 'Transferred' once Zuora Revenue receives a positive confirmation that the data was successfully consumed by the ERP.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Journal entries"}
{"instruction": "How do I prevent a specific Manual Journal Entry (MJE) from being transferred to the General Ledger?", "response": "To prevent an MJE from transferring to the GL, you should ensure the 'GL Transfer' flag is set to 'No' (or unchecked) when creating or uploading the MJE. If an entry was already created and needs to be excluded from future batches without deleting it, a common 'dummy post' workaround involves updating the entry's 'Interfaced' flag to 'Y' and setting the Transfer Batch ID to a dummy value (e.g., '9999') via a data fix, which tells the system the entry has already been processed.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Journal entries"}
{"instruction": "Why are 'Initial Entry' lines visible in the Revenue Contract audit trail but missing from the Transfer Accounting file?", "response": "'Initial Entry' lines are generated by the system when invoices or sales orders are first collected into Zuora Revenue. These lines are primarily for internal reporting, calculation of net changes, and audit trails within the sub-ledger. They are often not intended for the General Ledger and are filtered out of the Transfer Accounting file by design, as only the final 'Recognized' or 'Deferred' accounting entries are meant to be posted to the GL.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Journal entries"}
{"instruction": "How can I correct a posted Manual Journal Entry (MJE) that has incorrect segment data?", "response": "You cannot directly edit a posted MJE. The correct procedure is to reverse the incorrect MJE and then create a new MJE with the correct segment data. In the Manual JE UI, locate the posted entry, select the 'Reverse' action to create a reversal entry (which zeroes out the impact), and then upload or create a fresh MJE with the accurate accounting segments.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Journal entries"}
{"instruction": "What steps are required to upload a Manual Journal Entry (MJE) via file?", "response": "To upload an MJE, navigate to 'File Upload' > 'Manual JE' in the Zuora Revenue UI. Download the standard MJE template, fill in the required fields (including JE Name, Ledger, Debit/Credit Amounts, and Segments), and upload the file. Once uploaded, the system validates the data; if successful, the batch status changes to 'Validated', and you must then proceed to 'Approve' the batch before the entries are posted and eligible for Transfer Accounting.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Journal entries"}
{"instruction": "Why might a Transfer Accounting batch fail with an 'Unbalanced' error?", "response": "A Transfer Accounting batch will fail validation if the total Debits do not equal the total Credits within the batch or grouping key. This often happens due to rounding differences in multi-currency environments, missing mapping for a specific transaction type, or an incorrect setup in the 'Accounting Setup' where a one-sided entry is defined. You must review the specific batch error log to identify the off-balance amount and the specific accounting event causing the discrepancy.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Journal entries"}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of the 'Summarization' feature in Transfer Accounting?", "response": "The Summarization feature aggregates multiple individual journal lines into a single line based on shared attributes (such as GL Account, Accounting Date, and Segments) before sending them to the General Ledger. This is a best practice for high-volume customers, as it significantly reduces the number of records the ERP needs to process while maintaining the necessary financial granularity for the General Ledger.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Journal entries"}
{"instruction": "What should I check if MJE lines are not appearing in the 'Transfer Accounting' file despite being approved?", "response": "If approved MJE lines are missing from the Transfer Accounting file, check the following: 1) Ensure the 'GL Transfer' flag was set to 'Yes' on the MJE. 2) Verify that the MJE falls within the accounting period selected for the transfer batch. 3) Check if the MJE was already picked up by a previous batch (look for a populated Batch ID on the MJE line). 4) Ensure the accounting period is open and no holds are preventing the transfer.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Journal entries"}
{"instruction": "Can I use 'Mass Actions' to update accounting segments on unposted journal entries?", "response": "No, 'Mass Actions' generally cannot be used to update accounting segments on Manual Journal Entries (MJEs) because MJEs are not standard Revenue Contract lines. If you have unposted MJEs with incorrect segments, you should delete or reject the pending MJE batch and upload a corrected file. For system-generated entries, you would typically modify the underlying configuration or transaction data and re-run the accounting process.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Journal entries"}
{"instruction": "What is the function of the 'MJE Approval' workflow?", "response": "The MJE Approval workflow ensures that manual entries are reviewed before impacting the general ledger. When an MJE is created or uploaded, it enters a 'Pending Approval' state. Designated approvers (configured based on roles or thresholds) must review the entry details and click 'Approve' or 'Reject'.

{"instruction": "List the recommended sequence of mandatory programs to run during the Zuora Revenue period-close process.", "response": "The recommended sequence for period-close programs is: 1) RevPro3.0 Netting Process (to calculate CA/CL balances), 2) RevPro3.0 LT/ST Process (for long-term/short-term reclassification), 3) RevPro3.0 Accounting Transfer Master (to post unposted entries to GL), 4) RevPro3.0 Sweep Unposted Schedules (to move unposted items to the next period), 5) RevPro3.0 Current Period Post Summarize Data (to update reporting data), and finally 6) RevPro3.0 Reporting Current Period Close (to move waterfall data to history).", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Zuora Revenue - Period close process"}
{"instruction": "How do I resolve 'Overstated Orders' exceptions found in the Data Validation tab of the Close Process Dashboard?", "response": "Overstated Orders occur when a sales order line's net sell price exceeds the net billing amount. To resolve this, you can click 'Details' in the dashboard to view the specific Sales Order (SO) line ID and Revenue Contract (RC) ID. You should then verify the order and billing amounts in the upstream system or Revenue Workbench.

{"instruction": "Why am I receiving the error 'This hold is being consumed and cannot be modified' when trying to edit a hold's criteria?", "response": "This error occurs because the hold definition is currently applied to existing transactions in the system. Zuora Revenue prevents modifying active hold criteria to ensure data integrity. To resolve this, you must either release the hold from all affected transactions first or, more commonly, disable the existing hold definition and create a new hold rule with the updated criteria.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Revenue holds"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended best practice for managing hold reason codes?", "response": "It is best practice to define standard 'Reason Codes' within the 'Holds Setup' configuration (under Policies > Holds and Approvals) rather than relying on free-text comments.

{"instruction": "What step is required to release a 'Transfer Hold' that re-appears after re-allocation?", "response": "If a transfer hold reappears after being released and re-allocated, it often indicates a persistent data discrepancy or a configuration conflict. You should review the specific Transfer Hold logic in the Policies menu to identify the trigger (e.g., negative balance check). If the data is correct, you may need to use the 'RevPro3.0 Event Release' program or manually intervene in the Workbench to clear the specific validation blocking the transfer.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Revenue holds"}
{"instruction": "How does 'Event-Based' hold release work?", "response": "Event-based release requires defining a specific event type (e.g., 'Delivery' or 'Acceptance') in the Event Setup. In the hold configuration, you link this event as the release trigger. The hold remains active until the specific event data is uploaded or generated for the transaction, at which point the system (often via the POB Release program) releases the hold.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Revenue holds"}
{"instruction": "Why might a revenue hold not release automatically even after the expiry date has passed?", "response": "This issue typically happens if the 'RevPro3.0 Immediate POB Release' program has not been executed or is failing. The system does not release expired holds in real-time; the batch job must run to identify and process these expired holds. Check the Schedule Jobs history to ensure the program completed successfully.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Revenue holds"}
{"instruction": "What precaution should be taken before deploying new hold rules to Production?", "response": "Always configure and test new hold rules in a Sandbox environment first.

Ensure that the adjustment aligns with the revenue recognition principles and is properly documented.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Manual adjustments"}
{"instruction": "What triggers a reallocation of revenue in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "Revenue reallocation is typically triggered by a 'Contract Modification' event. This occurs when there is a change in the scope or price of a revenue contract, such as a price increase or decrease, quantity change (upsell/downsell), term modification (extension/reduction), or a subscription cancellation. Zuora Revenue evaluates these changes against your configured Contract Modification Rules to determine if a reallocation is required.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Reallocation scenarios"}
{"instruction": "Explain the difference between 'Prospective' and 'Retrospective' allocation treatments.", "response": "Prospective allocation terminates the existing contract and treats the remaining unearned revenue and any new changes as a 'new' contract, reallocating the remaining transaction price across remaining performance obligations (POBs) for future periods only. Retrospective allocation (Cumulative Catch-up) treats the change as if it were part of the original contract; it reallocates the *full* transaction price across all POBs from the contract inception and posts a cumulative true-up adjustment in the current period to correct past revenue recognition.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Reallocation scenarios"}
{"instruction": "How can I prevent a specific transaction line from triggering a contract modification rule?", "response": "You can prevent a specific transaction line from triggering a contract modification rule (and thus potentially changing dates or treatment) by setting the 'SKIP_CT_MOD_FLAG' field to 'Y' (Yes) on that transaction line. When this flag is set, the system will only perform a standard re-allocation of values without triggering the broader contract modification logic that might alter the contract modification end date or treatment.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Reallocation scenarios"}
{"instruction": "What should I do if I see unreleased revenue or a contract asset balance remaining after a full cancellation?", "response": "If a contract is fully canceled but still shows an unreleased revenue or contract asset balance, it is often due to 'Impairment' where the prospective allocation method could not fully clear the carve-out amounts. You should verify if an Impairment Type is configured to handle these balances. If not, you may need to manually switch the allocation method to 'Retrospective' (if allowed) to force a full recalculation and clearing of balances, or use a manual journal entry to clear the residual amounts.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Reallocation scenarios"}
{"instruction": "Where do I configure the rules that determine whether a change triggers a Prospective or Retrospective reallocation?", "response": "Navigate to Policies > Contract Modification. In this screen, you can define 'Contract Modification Rules' based on specific scenarios (e.g., Price Increase, Price Decrease, Quantity Change). For each scenario, you select the desired 'Allocation Treatment' (Prospective, Retrospective, New Revenue Contract, or No Allocation) that the system should apply when that specific change is detected.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Reallocation scenarios"}
{"instruction": "Can I switch a revenue contract's allocation method from Retrospective to Prospective manually?", "response": "No, generally you cannot switch from Retrospective to Prospective. Once a contract has been processed with Retrospective allocation, the system has effectively rewritten history to align with the new transaction price. It cannot revert to a state that supports Prospective allocation (which relies on preserving historical balances). You can typically only switch from Prospective *to* Retrospective.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Reallocation scenarios"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'New Contract' allocation treatment and when is it used?", "response": "The 'New Contract' treatment is used when a modification adds distinct goods or services to the contract at their standalone selling price (SSP).

{"instruction": "How does Zuora Revenue handle a 'Term Decrease' modification?", "response": "A term decrease is usually treated as a Retrospective modification because it often implies that the revenue recognized in the past was based on a longer term than valid. The system will recalculate the revenue based on the new, shorter term and post a negative cumulative adjustment (impairment) in the current period to correct the over-recognition from prior periods.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Reallocation scenarios"}
{"instruction": "Why would I see a 'No Data Found' error when processing a cancellation or modification?", "response": "A 'No Data Found' error during a modification often indicates a mismatch in dates or versioning. For example, if you attempt to process a cancellation with a date that falls in a closed period or predates the subscription's start date without a valid open period for adjustment, the system may fail to find the eligible revenue schedules to modify. Ensure the cancellation date aligns with the current open accounting period or valid transaction dates.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Reallocation scenarios"}
{"instruction": "What is the impact of the 'Unfreeze' action on reallocation?", "response": "Manually 'Unfreezing' a Revenue Contract in the Workbench can trigger the 'Manually Unfreeze the RC' contract modification rule.

{"instruction": "Why might I see a debit balance on a revenue account for a foreign currency transaction?", "response": "A debit balance on a revenue account can result from Foreign Exchange (FX) fluctuations. For example, a 'Realized FX Loss' might occur if a payment is collected at a different rate than the invoice date, and this loss is recorded as a debit. Additionally, revenue adjustments or carve-outs recognized in the period could lead to a net debit balance if they exceed the credit entries.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Multi-entity/multi-currency"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended approach for handling exchange rate differences between Invoice and Credit Memo?", "response": "To prevent variance and residual balances in the Contract Liability account, it is recommended that reversing transactions, such as Credit Memos, use the **same exchange rate** as the original Invoice they are reversing.

{"instruction": "Why did a Bill Run fail to generate an invoice for a specific active subscription?", "response": "Common reasons include: 1) The Bill Run's **Target Date** is before the subscription's next scheduled billing date. 2) The subscription or account is in a status that prevents invoicing (e.g., Draft or Suspended). 3) The Billing Rules are configured to put negative/zero charges on a Credit Memo instead of an Invoice. 4) The invoice was already generated by a concurrent or previous Bill Run. Check the Bill Run log for specific error messages like 'Invoice generation failure'.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Standard Objects"}
{"instruction": "How can I export historical data for standard objects like Invoices and Payments?", "response": "For robust historical data export, use **Data Query** or **Data Sources** under the Reporting tab. You can run a query such as `SELECT * FROM Invoice WHERE AccountId = '...'` to retrieve full historical datasets. Avoid using deprecated 'Exports' features if possible, as Data Query provides better performance and flexibility.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Standard Objects"}
{"instruction": "What is the relationship between the Account object and the Subscription object?", "response": "The Account and Subscription objects have a parent-child relationship. One **Account** can hold multiple **Subscriptions**. The Account object stores customer-level data (Contact info, Payment Methods, Bill To/Sold To), while the Subscription object stores product, pricing, and term information specific to the service being purchased.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Standard Objects"}
{"instruction": "How do I generate an invoice immediately after activating an order?", "response": "Order activation itself does not automatically trigger invoice generation unless specific processing options are used in the API. The standard procedure is to execute a **Bill Run** immediately after activation. Navigate to **Billing** > **Bill Runs** > **Create Bill Run** and set the Target Date to include the subscription's start date.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Standard Objects"}
{"instruction": "What does the 'Out of Term' status indicate for a Subscription?", "response": "'Out of Term' is a sub-state of an **Active** subscription where the current date is past the subscription's `SubscriptionEndDate`. It indicates that the subscription term has finished but the subscription has not yet been renewed or cancelled. Billing may continue depending on the 'Auto-Renew' setting.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Standard Objects"}
{"instruction": "How can I resolve a 'NonUniqueObjectException' error during a Bill Run?", "response": "This error typically indicates a concurrency issue where multiple processes (e.g., two Bill Runs or a Bill Run and a Data Collection job) are trying to process the same Account or Subscription simultaneously. To resolve this, ensure that scheduled jobs do not overlap and retry the Bill Run for the affected accounts once other jobs have completed.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Standard Objects"}
{"instruction": "Where can I view the definitions and schema of all standard objects in my tenant?", "response": "You can view standard object definitions, including fields and relationships, by navigating to **Extension Studio** > **Object Manager**. This interface lists all available objects (Account, Invoice, Product, etc.) and allows you to inspect their schema, including standard and custom fields.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Standard Objects"}
{"instruction": "Can I delete a posted Invoice object from Zuora?", "response": "No, once an Invoice object is in **Posted** status, it cannot be deleted due to audit and financial integrity requirements. To correct a posted invoice, you must use **Credit Memos** or **Debit Memos** to adjust the balance, or **Cancel** the invoice if your tenant configuration allows invoice cancellation.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Standard Objects"}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of the 'Contact' object in relation to the 'Account' object?", "response": "The **Contact** object stores individual personal or business contact details (Name, Address, Email).

The Account object relies on the Contact object for tax calculation and invoice delivery addresses.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Standard Objects"}
{"instruction": "How do I prevent a specific Subscription from generating invoices during a Bill Run?", "response": "To prevent a subscription from invoicing, you can set the **Auto-Renew** to 'No' (if it's expiring) or enable the **Invoice Owner** feature to redirect billing to a different account. For temporary suspension, you can use the **Suspend** amendment on the subscription to halt billing for a specific period.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Standard Objects"}
{"instruction": "Why am I unable to see a newly created custom field on the Account object in the UI?", "response": "If a custom field is not visible, check the **Field Access** permissions or 'UI Read Only' settings in the custom field definition.

Each Charge can have one or more Tiers (pricing levels).", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Object relationships"}
{"instruction": "What is the relationship between Account, Bill To Contact, and Sold To Contact?", "response": "An **Account** object has a lookup relationship to the **Contact** object for both `BillToId` and `SoldToId`. An Account can have multiple Contacts associated with it (1:N), but it must have exactly one Contact designated as the 'Bill To' contact and one as the 'Sold To' contact (which can be the same person) to be active.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Object relationships"}
{"instruction": "How do Usage records link to a Subscription?", "response": "Usage records are linked to a Subscription through the **Account** and **Charge** identifiers. Specifically, a Usage record must specify an `AccountId` and often a `SubscriptionNumber` or `ChargeId` to be rated against the correct Subscription Rate Plan Charge. The rating engine matches the usage to the active Rate Plan Charge for that period.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Object relationships"}
{"instruction": "Can a Payment object be directly linked to a Subscription?", "response": "No, the **Payment** object is typically linked to an **Account** and one or more **Invoices** (or Debit Memos).

{"instruction": "What is the 'Trunk' relationship model recommended for Data Query joins?", "response": "The recommended 'Trunk' hierarchy for joining objects without duplication is: **Account** -> **Subscription** -> **Rate Plan** -> **Rate Plan Charge** -> **Invoice Item** -> **Invoice** -> **Payment**. You should always join 'up' towards the trunk (many-to-one) or carefully manage one-to-many joins to avoid exploding row counts.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Object relationships"}
{"instruction": "How are Quote objects in Zuora CPQ related to Accounts and Opportunities?", "response": "A **Quote** object in Zuora CPQ (Salesforce) is related to an **Account** (potential or existing customer) and often an **Opportunity**. A Quote can contain multiple **Quote Rate Plans**, which convert into Subscription Rate Plans upon conversion to an Order/Subscription in Zuora Billing.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Object relationships"}
{"instruction": "What object connects a Credit Memo to an Invoice?", "response": "A **Credit Memo** is applied to an **Invoice** through the **Credit Memo Part** (or similar application object, often implicit in the `AppliedAmount` logic or explicit in `CreditMemoApplication`). You can trace the application of a Credit Memo balance to specific Invoice Items.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Object relationships"}
{"instruction": "Is there a direct relationship between a User object and an Account?", "response": "In the standard Zuora data model, **Users** (Zuora login users) are system administrators or operators and do not have a direct native lookup relationship to customer **Account** objects, unlike a CRM where a 'Owner' field might link to a User. However, custom fields can be created on the Account to store a 'Sales Rep' or 'CSM' name/ID.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Object relationships"}
{"instruction": "How do Custom Objects relate to Standard Objects in Zuora?", "response": "Custom Objects can be defined with a specific relationship type to Standard Objects (like Account or Subscription).

Map the CSV columns to the Custom Object fields and execute the job.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Custom objects and fields"}
{"instruction": "Why did my Data Loader import for a Custom Object fail with 'Invalid field format' errors?", "response": "This often happens if the data in your CSV does not match the field type defined in the Custom Object schema. For example, providing an alphanumeric string for a field defined as **Integer** or **Number** will cause failure. Check your CSV data against the object definition in Object Manager and correct any mismatches (e.g., change the field type to Text if alphanumeric data is expected).", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Custom objects and fields"}
{"instruction": "Can I use Custom Fields in Zuora Billing reports and invoices?", "response": "Yes, Custom Fields on standard objects (like Account, Subscription, Invoice) are automatically available in **Data Query**, **Data Sources** (Reporting), and **Invoice Templates** (using merge fields like `Account.CustomFieldName__c`). For Custom Objects, you must join them to standard objects in Data Query to include them in reports.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Custom objects and fields"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between 'Legacy' custom fields and 'Custom Object' fields?", "response": "Legacy custom fields (often referred to as 'Custom Fields' in older menus) are extensions directly on standard objects but had limitations in indexing and type. The modern **Object Manager** unifies this by treating standard object extensions and standalone custom objects similarly, offering better indexing, more field types, and API support.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Custom objects and fields"}
{"instruction": "How do I link a Custom Object to a Standard Object (e.g., link 'Vehicle' to 'Account')?", "response": "To link a Custom Object to a Standard Object, create a field on the Custom Object with the field type **Text** and name it with a suffix indicating the relationship (e.g., `AccountId__c`). In your data, populate this field with the Zuora ID of the parent Account. While strict foreign key constraints are not always enforced, this allows you to join the objects in Data Query.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Custom objects and fields"}
{"instruction": "What happens if I try to delete a Custom Field that is being used in a Workflow or Report?", "response": "Zuora may prevent you from deleting a Custom Field if it is actively referenced in dependencies like **Workflows**, **Bill Run** filters, or **Product Catalog** rules.

{"instruction": "I am receiving an 'Unexpected Error' (e.g., F02748AE...) when running a Data Source Export on the Account object. How can I troubleshoot this?", "response": "This generic error can sometimes be caused by specific, less-common fields in your export selection. For example, the field 'Do not print name on invoice' on the Account object has been known to cause export failures. To troubleshoot, try deselecting non-essential fields (especially checkbox or legacy fields) and re-running the export to isolate the problematic column.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Zuora Data Source exports"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended base data source object for reporting on Recurring Revenue (MRR/TCV/ARR)?", "response": "For recurring revenue metrics like MRR, TCV, or ARR, you should use the 'Rate Plan Charge' data source. This object captures the specific subscription charge attributes required for these calculations, whereas higher-level objects like Subscription or Account do not provide the necessary charge-level granularity.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Zuora Data Source exports"}
{"instruction": "How can I programmatically retrieve the schema or field names for a Data Source Export, given there is no 'describe' API?", "response": "Since Zuora does not publish a dedicated schema API for Data Source Exports, you have two options: (1) Use the Data Query API to run 'SHOW COLUMNS FROM [Table_Name]' to inspect the schema programmatically, as the underlying models are similar. (2) Refer to the 'Reporting → Data Sources' UI, as the field names displayed there generally match the object and field names used in Export ZOQL and the Export API.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Zuora Data Source exports"}
{"instruction": "What is the 'Trunk Relationship Model' and why is it important for Data Source Exports?", "response": "The Trunk Relationship Model is a hierarchy rule designed to prevent data duplication. It dictates that you should always join 'up' toward the trunk (many-to-one paths only). The hierarchy is: Account → Subscription → Rate Plan → Rate Plan Charge → Invoice Item → Invoice → Payment/Refund. Adhering to this model ensures you do not inadvertently create Cartesian products that inflate your metrics.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Zuora Data Source exports"}
{"instruction": "Which API endpoint should I use to trigger a Data Source Export programmatically?", "response": "To trigger a Data Source Export via API, use the `POST /v1/object/export` endpoint.

{"instruction": "My Data Source Export failed with an 'Input Rows for objectName exceeded limit' error. What should I do?", "response": "This error occurs when the query attempts to scan more than 10 million rows. To resolve this: (1) Add stricter filters to your query (e.g., narrow the Date range or filter by Status) to reduce the input set. (2) If you need to analyze a larger volume of historical data, switch to using Data Query in 'Warehouse' mode, which supports significantly higher volume limits.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Zuora Data Source exports"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended data source for creating a report on 'Unpaid Invoice Lines'?", "response": "For reporting on unpaid invoice lines, use the 'Invoice Item' data source.

{"instruction": "How do I filter a Data Source Export to show only 'Posted' invoices and 'Processed' payments?", "response": "You should apply standard Knowledge Center (KC) filters in your Export ZOQL or UI configuration. For invoices, set `Invoice.Status = 'Posted'`. For payments, set `Payment.Status = 'Processed'`. This ensures you are reporting on recognized financial data and excluding draft or error-state records.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Zuora Data Source exports"}
{"instruction": "Why should I avoid using Data Query for simple, single-source extracts?", "response": "Using Data Query for simple extracts is considered an anti-pattern because it adds unnecessary complexity and overhead. Data Source Exports are optimized for these operational tasks, utilizing managed joins that are pre-validated by Zuora. Data Query should be reserved for scenarios requiring complex SQL joins, CTEs, or cross-source aggregations that Exports cannot handle.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Zuora Data Source exports"}
{"instruction": "I need to fetch the 'AccountReceivableAccountingCode' Id via API. How do I construct the SELECT statement?", "response": "To fetch the ID for the Accounts Receivable Accounting Code, you must reference the internal object name `AccountReceivableAccountingCode` in your Export ZOQL. Your query should look like: `SELECT InvoiceItem.Id, AccountReceivableAccountingCode.Id, AccountReceivableAccountingCode.Name FROM InvoiceItem ...`. You cannot query this object in isolation; it must be selected as a related object from a base data source like Invoice Item.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Zuora Data Source exports"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between 'Live' mode and 'Warehouse' mode when running data extracts?", "response": "'Live' mode is intended for small, real-time operational queries with tight filters (scanning fewer than 10 million rows).

{"instruction": "I am receiving the error 'Input Rows for objectName exceeded limit (10000000)' when running a Data Query. How do I resolve this?", "response": "This error occurs because the query is running in 'Live' mode, which has a hard scan limit of 10 million rows. To resolve this, you must either: (1) Add stricter filters on indexed fields (e.g., UpdatedDate, CreatedDate, AccountId) to reduce the number of rows scanned, or (2) Switch the query mode to 'Warehouse' (if available), which supports significantly larger datasets but has higher latency.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "AQuA and Data Query"}
{"instruction": "How can I obtain the 'Partner ID' required to run Stateful (incremental) AQuA jobs?", "response": "You cannot generate a Partner ID for AQuA yourself via the UI or API.

Once created, you use this ID in your AQuA request headers to track the state of your data exports.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "AQuA and Data Query"}
{"instruction": "What is the correct SQL syntax for calculating the difference between two dates in Data Query?", "response": "Data Query uses Spark SQL syntax, so you should use the `date_diff` function. The correct syntax is `date_diff('day', start_date, end_date)`. Do not use the T-SQL style `DATEDIFF(day, start, end)` as this will result in a syntax error.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "AQuA and Data Query"}
{"instruction": "How do I discover the available table names and column schemas available in Data Query since there is no 'describe' API?", "response": "You can programmatically discover the schema by running the SQL command `SHOW TABLES` to list all available tables, and `SHOW COLUMNS FROM [Table_Name]` to see the specific fields and data types for a given table directly within the Data Query tool or API.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "AQuA and Data Query"}
{"instruction": "When should I use 'Warehouse' mode instead of 'Live' mode in Data Query?", "response": "You should use 'Warehouse' mode when you need to perform complex analysis on large historical datasets, join multiple high-volume tables (like InvoiceItem and RatePlanCharge), or when your query exceeds the 10 million row scan limit of Live mode. Note that Warehouse data is typically refreshed daily and is not real-time.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "AQuA and Data Query"}
{"instruction": "Why does my Data Query result differ from a Zuora Report result even when the filters look similar?", "response": "This often happens because Data Query supports complex logic with parentheses (e.g., `A AND (B OR C)`), whereas the standard Reporting UI logic does not strictly support nested parentheses. This difference in logical operator precedence can lead to different result sets for complex filter conditions.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "AQuA and Data Query"}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of 'Stateful' mode in AQuA?", "response": "Stateful mode in AQuA is designed for continuous integration.

{"instruction": "What are the best practices for optimizing performance in Data Query?", "response": "To ensure optimal performance: (1) Always filter by indexed columns such as `Id`, `CreatedDate`, `UpdatedDate`, `AccountId`, or `SubscriptionId`. (2) Avoid `SELECT *`; only select the specific columns you need. (3) When joining tables, place the smaller table on the right side of the JOIN if possible (though the optimizer handles most cases). (4) Use `LIMIT` when testing queries.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "AQuA and Data Query"}
{"instruction": "I need to export data that includes a 'Deleted' record. Can I do this with Data Query?", "response": "Yes, Data Query tables often include a `deleted` column.

{"instruction": "How should I handle large data exports or heavy write operations to avoid timeouts?", "response": "For heavy operations, such as creating large orders or exporting significant data volumes, you should use Asynchronous API modes where available (often enabled via an `async: true` header or specific `bulk` endpoints). This allows Zuora to process the request in the background and prevents your client from timing out while waiting for a synchronous response.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Zuora REST API basics"}
{"instruction": "Can I use the same user account for both UI access and API integration?", "response": "It is a security and operational best practice to create a dedicated 'API User' that is separate from any human user account. This API user should ideally have UI access disabled to prevent password expirations or session conflicts, and it ensures that integration activity is clearly distinguishable from manual user actions in the audit logs.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Zuora REST API basics"}
{"instruction": "What is the `Idempotency-Key` header used for?", "response": "The `Idempotency-Key` header is used to safely retry requests without the risk of performing the same operation twice. For example, if a `POST` request to create a payment times out, sending the same request again with the same `Idempotency-Key` ensures that Zuora processes it only once, preventing duplicate charges.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Zuora REST API basics"}
{"instruction": "I am getting a '90000011' error code. What does this mean?", "response": "The error code `90000011` specifically signifies an 'Authentication error'. This usually means the credentials passed in your request (Bearer token or Basic Auth keys) are invalid, expired, or malformed. You should generate a new OAuth token or verify your API keys to resolve this.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Zuora REST API basics"}
