{"instruction":"What do the values 'L' and 'R' represent in the 'Accounting Type' field of the Unbilled Fx Report?","response":"The values 'L' and 'R' in the Accounting Type field of the Unbilled Fx Report typically relate to your specific accounting type setup configuration. You should review the accounting type setup in your environment to confirm what these specific codes map to for your implementation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Reporting"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR data migration require specific handling for subscriptions with a large number of versions (e.g., >200)?","response":"If the data is standard out-of-the-box (OOTB), specific issues are not anticipated solely due to version count. However, challenges often arise from data quality issues, such as owner transfers or account deletions occurring over those versions. If issues arise during migration, a support ticket should be raised for engineering assistance.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Can Revenue GL fields on the ProductRatePlanCharge (PRPC) be updated via API?","response":"Yes, you can update the revenue GL accounts on the PRPC using the PUT API endpoint: `https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/operation/PUT_RevProAccountingCodes/`.","category":"procedural","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"How are discounts handled in OTR, specifically regarding mapping to GL accounts and charges?","response":"In OTR, a Discount charge is treated as part of the regular charge it applies to. There are settings to allow Discounts to use their own GL accounts and dates. If you require the discount to be treated as a completely separate distinct charge with different behavior, you may need to use a non-discount charge type. For mapping, fields like `ApplyToSubscriptionID` or `Discount Applied to Rate Plan Charge` in the Booking Transaction object can be used to establish relationships.","category":"definitional","topic":"Discounts"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended solution for a customer with a single OTR tenant selling in multiple functional currencies (e.g., USD and EUR) across different entities?","response":"The recommended solution for handling multiple functional currencies across different entities (e.g., US and Ireland) is to use Multi-Org in Zuora Billing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"What is the expected CCV for pending charges if 'Generate all charges' is selected for Booking Transaction generation?","response":"Currently, the CCV for pending charges remains zero. A feature to provide estimated CCV based on estimated dates is in development but not yet available as of early 2025.","category":"definitional","topic":"CCV Calculation"}
{"instruction":"How is CCV calculated if a Fixed Amount Discount (FAD) is removed from a subscription?","response":"If a FAD is removed (e.g., from the beginning), the regular charge CCV reflects the full amount, and the FAD charge CCV will reflect only the discount amount that was actually billed prior to removal.","category":"definitional","topic":"CCV Calculation"}
{"instruction":"Can BookingTransaction and BillingTransaction objects be extracted from Zuora Billing to a Data Warehouse?","response":"Yes, these objects can be extracted to a data warehouse using an AQUA query.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Extraction"}
{"instruction":"Should custom fields for revenue reporting be mapped to the Booking or Billing transaction object?","response":"It depends on the specific use case. For example, if you are using standalone invoicing to form a revenue contract, fields should be mapped to the Billing Transaction object. The mapping location should align with the object driving the revenue logic.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Is Multi-Currency supported for K2 customers?","response":"No, Multi-Currency is not supported in the RevProIntegrationV2 (K2) environment. Customers must onboard with Order to Revenue (OTR) to utilize the Multi-Currency feature.","category":"comparison","topic":"Multi-Currency"}
{"instruction":"What steps should be taken to troubleshoot a subscription that fails to sync to Revenue?","response":"To troubleshoot sync issues: 1. Use Data Query to confirm data generated in Billing. 2. Check logs to see if the `SOLineId` was sent to Sunergy (Revenue integration layer). 3. Query the `zb_uno_event` table for `sent_on` and `received_on` timestamps. 4. Verify if Sunergy received the transaction.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sync Troubleshooting"}
{"instruction":"Does enabling Invoice Item Settlement (IIS) impact OTR?","response":"No, OTR supports both Invoice Item Adjustment (IIA) and Invoice Settlement (IS). IIS relates to how payments apply to billing documents and does not negatively impact OTR.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Settlement"}
{"instruction":"Can reconciliation tables (e.g., RPRO_UNO_RECON_*) be exposed to customers for Data Warehouse reporting?","response":"No, these are temporary internal tables and should not be exposed. Customers should extract the standard `BookingTransaction` and `BillingTransaction` objects from Billing to build their own reconciliation or reporting views.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Reconciliation"}
{"instruction":"Can prepayment charges flow into revenue as usage charges instead of 'Upon Event'?","response":"Typically, a prepayment charge represents cash on account (liability) and is not itself revenue. The revenue recognition event is triggered by the consumption (usage) items that draw down that balance.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepaid"}
{"instruction":"Does performing a suspend and resume action on the same day create a new charge segment?","response":"If the relevant permission is enabled, suspend and resume actions on the same day will split the segment. The system generally defaults to using enhanced CCV logic.","category":"definitional","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"What should be checked if a user cannot access or save OTR Settings?","response":"Check the user role permissions. The \"Manage OTR Settings\" privilege must be enabled. If the standard Administrator role does not have this visible, you may need to create a new custom role with this specific permission enabled.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Permissions"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support 'prepaid cash with drawdown' and does it impact revenue?","response":"Prepaid cash with drawdown is primarily a payment/collection feature and does not directly affect revenue. Revenue is driven by the orders and subsequent consumption/usage.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepaid"}
{"instruction":"How is the estimated end date derived for recurring charges on evergreen subscriptions in OTR?","response":"In OTR, the estimated end date for evergreen subscriptions is typically calculated as the current term plus one additional Billing Period (BP).","category":"definitional","topic":"Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"Is the API to regenerate booking transactions public?","response":"Yes, the Regenerate API is public. Documentation is available under the 'Regenerate' tag in the API reference.","category":"definitional","topic":"API"}
{"instruction":"How does the backfill utility handle revenue fields for Product Rate Plan Charges (PRPC) versus Invoice Items?","response":"The auto-backfill utility copies revenue field values from the PRPC to the Rate Plan Charge (RPC) and Order Line Item (OLI). It does *not* automatically update Invoice Items or Memo Items; flags for those must be updated manually if needed.","category":"procedural","topic":"Backfill"}
{"instruction":"What happens to OTR settings when a Revenue Sandbox is refreshed from Production?","response":"If OTR is not enabled in the source Production environment, refreshing the Sandbox will reset the OTR settings (profiles). OTR settings are not automatically preserved if the source does not have them.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sandbox Refresh"}
{"instruction":"Is it supported to change the Bill Cycle Day (BCD) for an OTR customer?","response":"Changing BCD is generally complex in OTR. However, if the BCD change occurs alongside a Terms & Conditions (T&C) order action (e.g., switching from monthly to annual on a new date), it is supported. The first CCV will use the billed amount.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Bill Cycle Day"}
{"instruction":"Can custom fields on the Contact object be mapped to Revenue?","response":"It is not recommended to map custom fields from the Contact object because updates to contact fields are not automatically synced to Revenue, which can lead to reporting inconsistencies. It is better to use snapshot fields (like Bill To/Sold To) or capture the data at the Subscription level.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Custom Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How can historical unbilled usage be migrated to Revenue?","response":"Historical data cannot be converted to unbilled usage during migration. A common workaround is to perform a consumption upload to release the revenue for those historical periods.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"What is the logic for 'Sales Order Line ID' and 'Sales Order Line Number' in the Booking Transaction object?","response":"The `Sales Order Line ID` maps to the original Rate Plan Charge (RPC) Segment ID. The `Sales Order Line Number` maps to the Charge Number.","category":"definitional","topic":"Booking Transaction"}
{"instruction":"Does the inline discount functionality support Pay-As-You-Go (PayGo) usage?","response":"Yes, inline discounts support unbilled usage (PayGo) and PPDD (Prepaid with Drawdown), but they do not support committed usage models.","category":"definitional","topic":"Discounts"}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between 'Before Validate' and 'Before Bundle Explode' stages in Data Augmentation?","response":"'Before Validate' runs before validation logic on the source data. 'Before Bundle Explode' runs after validation but before the bundle is exploded; this stage is useful for applying generic manipulations that should trickle down to parent and child lines to avoid duplicating efforts.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Augmentation"}
{"instruction":"How does OTR Data Migration determine which subscriptions and charges to migrate based on the cutover date?","response":"Migration selects subscriptions where the cutover date falls between the Term Start and Term End dates. For selected subscriptions, charges active in that term (and their history, if amended) are migrated. If a recurring charge is active in the current term but was added in a previous term, its history is also included.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"What are the default values for 'Allocation Eligible' and 'Right To Bill' revenue flags?","response":"The default value for these flags is 'No'. This is intentional to force a detailed analysis during enablement. You can use the data backfill tool to update these fields on the Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC).","category":"procedural","topic":"Configuration"}
{"instruction":"What is the recommended order for enabling Invoice Settlement (IS) and OTR?","response":"While they are independent, for existing customers undergoing billing modernization, it is recommended to enable and validate Invoice Settlement (IS) first before proceeding with OTR data migration.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Enablement"}
{"instruction":"Should allocation be enabled for standalone/adhoc Credit Memos in OTR?","response":"It is generally recommended to disable allocation for standalone Credit Memos, as these are typically used for write-offs or goodwill and should not impact the original booking allocation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"Is unposting invoices supported in OTR?","response":"Unposting invoices is strongly discouraged and often disabled in OTR because it causes 'double invoicing' issues in Revenue (original + reversal + new invoice). The recommended practice is to use Invoice Reversal or Invoice Item Adjustments.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Invoicing"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR Data Migration support evergreen subscriptions?","response":"Yes, evergreen subscriptions participate in data migration as long as they are active (effective end date is blank/open).","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"What should be done if the 'Change Plan' order action is needed in an OTR-enabled tenant, given that documentation suggests it might not be supported?","response":"While some documentation (specifically regarding K2 integration) states that 'Change Plan' is not supported, OTR (Order to Revenue) does support the 'Change Plan' order action. The confusion often arises because documentation for K2 (Billing-Revenue Integration) lists it as unsupported. If an error like 'change plan is not supported' occurs, it may be because K2 permissions are still active. To resolve this, ensure that the tenant is correctly configured for OTR and that K2 permissions are disabled if OTR is the intended integration method. You should confirm with the support or engineering team that the tenant settings are correct.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"OTR Order Actions"}
{"instruction":"How should credit card surcharges be handled in Zuora Revenue?","response":"Credit card surcharges are typically considered a reduction in cost or a separate fee and do not integrate natively into Zuora Revenue as standard revenue items. They usually generate a debit memo (DM). If the 'Exclude Item from Revenue Accounting' flag is not configured, the surcharge (as a DM) and any subsequent refunds or write-offs may flow to revenue, which is often not the desired behavior. The recommended approach is often to exclude these transactions from revenue accounting via the exclude flags. If a refund occurs, unapplying the payment and refunding both the surcharge and the original invoice is the standard process, where the surcharge DM is automatically written off.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Credit Card Surcharges"}
{"instruction":"What is the best way to support usage-based credits or 'SLA' style credits based on transaction volume in OTR?","response":"For usage-based credits (e.g., SLA penalties or volume-based rebates), Zuora Billing supports creating a usage charge with a negative per-unit price (e.g., 250 transactions @ -0.03 = -$7.50). This results in a negative charge that can be processed. However, typically revenue cannot recognize usage charges that are negative directly as standard usage. Mediation can calculate the credit, but the resulting negative usage charge needs to be handled carefully. It effectively acts as a rebate or reduction in transaction fees.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Credits"}
{"instruction":"Why does the error 'Amount Based Events is Not Supported only for Recurring charges' occur when sending One Time charges with amount-based event release?","response":"This error occurs because Amount Based Events are generally designed for recurring charges in the standard configuration. If you are attempting to use them for One Time charges in an OTR instance, you may encounter this limitation. This is often a configuration or product limitation that requires verification with the Revenue product team.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Amount Based Events"}
{"instruction":"How can I fix the 'No Open Periods' error in Zuora Revenue after creating a new Org and mapping it, while the Default Org works fine?","response":"If you create a new Org in Revenue and map it to Billing entities, but see 'No Open Periods', you likely need to open the periods for that specific new Org in the Revenue Console. If the Default Org works but the new one doesn't, ensure the new Org is active and periods are explicitly opened for it. If you revert to the Default Org, you may need to adjust the Org mapping in Billing. However, editing Org mapping in Billing might be restricted after initial setup, requiring a support ticket to redo the mapping.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Org Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Will the new pending orders functionality work in Revenue if a customer is on Order Harmony (OH)?","response":"Yes, if a customer is on Order Harmony (OH), the new pending orders functionality should work in Revenue, provided the customer is using Orders within OH.","category":"definitional","topic":"Order Harmony"}
{"instruction":"What are the requirements for merging an OTR-enabled child entity with Zuora Revenue (Multi-Entity)?","response":"When merging entities in a Multi-Entity hierarchy where OTR is involved, the OTR setting must be enabled at the Global entity level. Both Global and Child entities should use a single integration method (OTR) and should not mix K2 and OTR. If migrating data to a new entity, ensure the global settings are correct.","category":"procedural","topic":"Multi-Entity Merge"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'Split Segment' setting recommended for ZB-ZR integration in OTR?","response":"Yes, the recommendation is to keep 'Split Segment' ON in OTR. Turning it OFF carries risks regarding how segments and revenue are handled, so enabling it is the standard best practice.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Split Segment"}
{"instruction":"How can I link CM-ROs (Credit Memo - Revenue Operations) to original Invoice transactions on the ZR side to fix exchange rate inheritance issues?","response":"In credit proration scenarios (e.g., remove product amendment), CM-ROs might inherit exchange rates from Sales Orders instead of the originating Invoices, causing FX differences. While this issue is addressed in the Q2 release, if you need to analyze the data or link them manually for impact analysis, there isn't a direct standard link exposed easily for end-users to modify FX inheritance without the fix. The system logic typically defaults to LIFO (Last In First Out) for credit memos against bookings.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Does pre-rated usage sent to Zuora Billing cause issues in Revenue for OTR customers not using SSP?","response":"Pre-rated usage sent to Billing acts as an unbilled usage upload. It generally has no negative impact on Revenue in OTR. It flows through as usage data.","category":"definitional","topic":"Pre-rated Usage"}
{"instruction":"Can I modify seeded POB templates (e.g., 'Upon Order Activation Ratable') to add VC types?","response":"You should not modify or make copies of seeded POB templates. The best practice is to create a new POB template from scratch if you need specific configurations like Variable Consideration (VC) or different cost rules, rather than trying to enable them on the seeded templates.","category":"best_practice","topic":"POB Templates"}
{"instruction":"Why are exchange rates missing in Revenue for booking transactions even if they are loaded in Billing for the order date?","response":"If exchange rates are loaded in Billing but not flowing to Revenue booking transactions, it may be a system sync issue or a specific bug (e.g., missing exchange rate issue on charges). In such cases, regenerating the booking transaction often does not fix it if the underlying sync failed. A support ticket is usually required to investigate why the rates didn't propagate.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Is 'Billing Based Revenue Recognition' a valid option for new OTR customers?","response":"While Billing-based revenue recognition allows for accurate accounting by processing only invoices, it is generally not recommended for new OTR customers. The feature exists primarily to support existing K2 customers transitioning to OTR. New OTR customers should rely on the standard OTR booking/billing flows.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Billing Based Rev Rec"}
{"instruction":"How can I update OTR fields (like 'Exclude from Revenue') to be blank/null via data backfill if the system returns a 'value is required' error?","response":"If you are trying to exclude a Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) from revenue using data backfill, you do not need to populate all other OTR fields. You can simply provide the Charge ID and set the 'Exclude Item Booking from Revenue Accounting' and 'Exclude Item Billing from Revenue Accounting' columns to 'True'. You do not need to set other fields to blank; omitting them or focusing on the exclude flags is sufficient.","category":"procedural","topic":"Data Backfill"}
{"instruction":"Why is usage uploaded in Billing not syncing to Revenue (rpro_daily_cnsmp_prestg_g table)?","response":"If usage is uploaded in Billing but not appearing in Revenue, check if 'Unbill Usage' is enabled. After enabling it, a migration by the engineering team might be required. Also, verify if the Daily Consumption object in DSE has values. Large data volumes in other tenants can sometimes cause processing delays (lag) in the shared environment.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Sync"}
{"instruction":"What is the source field for 'BookingTransaction.CurrentELP'?","response":"'BookingTransaction.CurrentELP' (Extended List Price) is calculated by OTR and does not have a direct source field in Billing. It is derived. If you see a $0 ELP where you expect a value, check the 'Original List Price' in the order action. If the list price in the Product Catalog (PRPC) is 0, you must set the 'originalListPrice' field in the Orders call to ensure the correct override value is used for calculation.","category":"definitional","topic":"Booking Transaction Fields"}
{"instruction":"Why are Revenue accounts missing in the Product Catalog UI for an OTR tenant?","response":"This is a known UI issue that can sometimes be related to VPN or network settings (e.g., Zscaler policies). Disconnecting from the VPN or updating Zscaler policies often resolves the visibility of Revenue accounts in the Billing UI. Alternatively, you can verify the fields exist via a data query or use data backfill to update them if the UI is blocked.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Product Catalog UI"}
{"instruction":"How does multi-currency behave in Zuora Revenue with OTR?","response":"In OTR, multi-currency support allows users to have multiple transaction currencies at the subscription or OLI level. There is no major change in how OTR or ZR works compared to standard logic; the system uses the transaction currency from the subscription. The major experience change is in Billing (capturing currencies at the sub level), while Revenue consumes the data as provided.","category":"definitional","topic":"Multi-Currency"}
{"instruction":"Can we execute a 'Change Plan' order action in OTR?","response":"Yes, OTR supports the 'Change Plan' order action. The limitation often cited in documentation refers to K2 (Billing-Revenue Integration), not OTR.","category":"definitional","topic":"Change Plan"}
{"instruction":"How can we migrate Product Catalog Revenue Accounting fields in an OTR implementation?","response":"Deployment Manager does not support migrating Revenue Accounting fields. The recommended approach is to use the Data Loader (Update Product Rate Plan Charge template). You can update fields like 'AllocationEligible', 'RevenueRecognitionTiming', 'RevenueAmortizationMethod', and 'Exclude' flags. The 'Right to Bill Flag' corresponds to the 'IsUnbilled' field in the PRPC API.","category":"procedural","topic":"Product Catalog Migration"}
{"instruction":"Is there a dashboard to monitor OTR connector performance?","response":"Currently, there is no customer-facing health dashboard for the OTR connector (unlike the Salesforce connector). The sync is designed to be near real-time. Performance monitoring is managed internally by the Product/Engineering teams.","category":"definitional","topic":"OTR Performance"}
{"instruction":"How can we split revenue between a partner and company account for the same subscription in OTR?","response":"The best approach is to use separate GL accounts rather than a bundle upload. Create a subscription with multiple usage charges—one for the partner and one for the company. When usage is uploaded, it will automatically take the GL account associated with the respective charge, splitting the revenue automatically during processing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Revenue Split"}
{"instruction":"Can we continue to run the ZBilling Revenue Detail Report after enabling OTR?","response":"Generally, enabling OTR turns off ZBilling Revenue capabilities. However, some customers want ZBilling to create Revenue Schedules for reporting (Revenue Detail Report) without creating Journal Entries. This is a specific configuration question, but typically OTR replaces ZBilling revenue recognition.","category":"definitional","topic":"ZBilling Reports"}
{"instruction":"Can we map custom fields to both RPC and OLI using the same attribute (e.g., ATR1) in OTR billing templates?","response":"In the Booking template, you can map the same attribute (ATR1) to custom fields on both RPC and OLI. However, in the Billing template, once an attribute is mapped to an RPC custom field, it may not be available for mapping to the OLI object. This is a known limitation in the Billing template mapping.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How should 'Usage Charges' be handled in OTR for consumption revenue?","response":"Usage charges should ideally be handled using the Consumption revenue model. Using standard usage charges with manually created POBs is not recommended. If you have a consumption use case (e.g., active prospect with free units and overage), use the standard Consumption POBs rather than custom ones. The system defaults the list price on usage charges to $0 in some contexts, so rely on the consumption/mediation flow.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Usage Charges"}
{"instruction":"Can we update custom fields on an invoice line after it has been collected in Revenue?","response":"No, updates to billing transactions (like invoice lines) are not allowed after they are collected. You cannot simply update the field and sync it. The workaround is usually to regenerate the booking/billing transactions if the period is open, but if already collected and processed, you may need to unapply/reverse or use a custom solution (which is difficult). Direct updates are blocked.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Invoice Updates"}
{"instruction":"What is the 'Right to Bill Flag' in the Product Rate Plan Charge API?","response":"The 'Right to Bill Flag' corresponds to the `IsUnbilled` field in the Product Rate Plan Charge API.","category":"definitional","topic":"API Fields"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support Invoice Adjustments (IA)?","response":"OTR only supports Invoice Item Adjustments. It does not support header-level Invoice Adjustments. If a customer needs adjustments, they must be at the line item level.","category":"definitional","topic":"Invoice Adjustments"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle a scenario where a manually created Credit Memo (CM) was applied to an invoice but a second CM was automatically generated?","response":"If a manually created CM (standalone) is applied, and the system also generates a CM (e.g., from an invoice reversal or similar action), you may end up with duplicates in Revenue. The recommended approach is to identify which CM is valid for revenue. If the second CM (CM2) is invalid or duplicate, you should write it off or purge it from the stage (if not collected). Ensure only the valid revenue-impacting CM is processed.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Credit Memos"}
{"instruction":"What are the limitations of OTR regarding 'Terms and Conditions' changes (Decreasing/Increasing Term)?","response":"There are known limitations when changing terms in OTR, specifically 'Decreasing term' and 'Increasing term when billing in advance'. If a term decrease occurs on an invoiced segment, a CM-C (Credit Memo-Cancellation) is generated. If the term creates a new segment, Billing might extend the segment instead, resulting in a CM-C that never gets a corresponding CM-RO (Revenue Operations) from upstream, leading to sync issues.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Term Changes"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support 'Change Plan' order actions?","response":"Yes, OTR supports 'Change Plan' order actions. Documentation stating it is unsupported refers to K2 (Legacy Billing-Revenue Integration).","category":"definitional","topic":"Change Plan"}
{"instruction":"How can I exclude specific billing items (Invoices, CMs) from Revenue in OTR?","response":"You can exclude specific billing items using the `Exclude Item Billing from Revenue Accounting` flag. This flag is available on Credit Memos (CMs) and Invoices via API. It allows you to prevent specific transactions from flowing to Revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"Revenue Exclusion"}
{"instruction":"What should be done if a 'Split Segment' is required for OTR?","response":"It is strongly recommended to keep 'Split Segment' ON in OTR configurations to ensure proper revenue handling and avoid risks associated with segment processing.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Split Segment"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support the 'Reflect Discount in Apply To Charge Net Amount' setting for Per Unit Pricing models?","response":"Currently, the event-based revenue recognition in OTR (which uses `Reflect Discount in Apply To Charge Net Amount`) primarily supports Delivery Pricing and Daily Consumption models. Support for Per Unit Pricing models with this specific discount reflection setting in OTR is limited or requires verification of the specific use case (often not supported out of the box).","category":"definitional","topic":"Discount Settings"}
{"instruction":"How do I map the 'Invoice Owner' to the 'Customer' field in Revenue for booking transactions?","response":"OTR maps the Subscription Owner as the Customer in Revenue by default. Mapping the Invoice Owner is possible but not ideal; standard mapping allows Name and Account Number. Standard attributes on the Invoice Owner might not be fully available for mapping to the Customer field in Revenue without custom configuration or workarounds.","category":"procedural","topic":"Customer Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How can I monitor the sync delay or 'lag' between Billing and Revenue in OTR?","response":"There is no customer-facing dashboard for sync lag yet (ticket UNO-3862 tracks this). You can check the 'Data Source' in Revenue to see if Booking/Billing transactions exist. If they exist in Data Source but not in Revenue Stage/Tables, there is a lag in ingestion. If they don't exist in Data Source, you can use the 'Regenerate' API to force the transaction generation.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sync Lag"}
{"instruction":"Is 'Order Owner Transfer' supported in OTR?","response":"Yes, Subscription Owner Transfer triggers a booking transaction update in Revenue (often seen as a version update). However, Invoice Owner Transfer does not trigger a booking transaction update in Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"Owner Transfer"}
{"instruction":"Can I map the 'Relative Invoice' (or Related Invoice) field on a Credit Memo to Revenue?","response":"Currently, the 'Related Invoice' field on a Credit Memo is not natively exposed for mapping in the standard OTR integration. You can map `BillingTransaction.InvoiceId` for the Credit Memo, but the specific 'Related Invoice' number field requires a product enhancement (User story UNO-3796 exists for this).","category":"definitional","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Can we set a future target date for evergreen subscriptions to generate a single invoice and SO update?","response":"Yes, using a future dated target date for evergreen subscriptions is supported and typically results in a single invoice in the system, which is the expected behavior.","category":"procedural","topic":"Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"How can we avoid revenue staging duplication during evergreen subscription migration if the automation tool triggers draft invoices for every order?","response":"This issue often stems from automation tooling triggering the invoice API for every order, creating multiple booking transactions. The recommended approach is to verify where the migration flag is applied and, if possible, load all accounts and orders first before running the Bill Run API at the end. Even if the Bill Run is invoked per order, it should be scoped to the specific subscription.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Is there a direct link between the OTR stage table and the Order Line Item (OLI) object?","response":"Yes, for OTR customers, you can link the stage table to the Order Line Item object by joining the `salesorderlineid` in the stage table with the `salesorderlineid` in the booking transaction, which matches the ID in the Order Line Item object.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Model"}
{"instruction":"What is the best practice for refreshing an OTR environment to ensure data consistency?","response":"It is recommended to refresh both the billing and revenue environments to avoid data inconsistency. If you need to revert a sandbox to a specific state (e.g., non-OTR matching Production), a refresh from Production will copy the relevant permissions and data.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Environment Management"}
{"instruction":"How does the 'Consume Deleted Transaction' setting affect deleted orders or amendments in OTR?","response":"If `CONSUME_DELETED_TRANSACTION` is disabled, deleted transactions may cause errors or remain in the inbound stage. Enabling it allows the system to process these deletions. Note that the 'Delete Amendment' feature for OTR is targeted for a future release (2025.Q4). Generally, deleting orders is not recommended; best practice is to use de-book/rebook or invoice reversals.","category":"definitional","topic":"Deleted Transactions"}
{"instruction":"Which date is used to derive the exchange rate in OTR integration?","response":"OTR integration typically uses the Invoice Date (Document Date) to derive the exchange rate.","category":"definitional","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Can we map custom fields from both Invoice and Credit Memo objects to the same ATR field in Revenue?","response":"Directly mapping custom fields from both Invoice and Credit Memo objects to the same ATR field at the object level is not supported. However, mapping is allowed for Invoice Items and Credit Memo Items. For OTR, mapping RPC and OLI to the same ATR is supported. To map fields like 'Ship To Country' to standard Revenue fields, they must typically be mapped to a revenue attribute first.","category":"procedural","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Is the 'Order Upgrade with Invoice Settlement' feature mandatory for OTR?","response":"No, Order and Invoice Settlement are independent features. OTR supports Subscribe/Amend, Orders, and Invoice Settlement.","category":"definitional","topic":"OTR Requirements"}
{"instruction":"How are FX rates handled for future-dated orders if the rate is not yet available?","response":"Booking transaction FX rates are calculated at the time of generation and do not auto-regenerate. It is recommended to not use future dates for the Order/Booking date; instead, use the current date and set the Effective Date to the future. If transactions fail due to missing rates, you may need to load rates into Revenue manually.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Exchange Rates"}
{"instruction":"Do Booking and Billing Transaction objects automatically update when an Order is deleted?","response":"No, if the booking or billing transaction has already been generated, it will not be automatically deleted when the upstream Order is deleted.","category":"definitional","topic":"Transaction Sync"}
{"instruction":"Can we group subscriptions from different Billing orgs into a single Revenue Contract?","response":"Yes, if the Revenue tenant is single-org, you can group subscriptions from different Billing orgs into one revenue contract using a common attribute. Be aware that allocations and modifications across different company codes may trigger intercompany accounting entries.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Multi-Org"}
{"instruction":"Can Invoice Item Adjustments (IIA) be regenerated and synced to Revenue?","response":"Yes, IIAs are supported in OTR. You can use the Billing Transaction regeneration API to sync them. Note that Tax IIAs generally do not sync to revenue.","category":"procedural","topic":"Transaction Regeneration"}
{"instruction":"Why might there be a small discrepancy between Invoice TCV and Sales Order CCV in migrated data?","response":"TCV does not sync to revenue. Discrepancies between Invoice TCV and Sales Order CCV in migrated data are often due to specific bugs or data inconsistencies which should be reported to support.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Data Consistency"}
{"instruction":"Why does a subscription cancellation sometimes not create a booking transaction in Revenue?","response":"If a subscription is cancelled effective on its original term end date (natural end), it is treated as a non-impacting event and no booking transaction is generated. Cancellations effectively before the term end (early termination) should generate booking transactions.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Cancellation"}
{"instruction":"Why are booking transactions failing to sync to Revenue despite being generated in Billing?","response":"This can occur due to mapping issues. For example, a mismatch in field length for `FV_ELIGIBLE_FLAG` (Billing sending 'true'/'false' vs Revenue expecting 1 char) has been known to cause sync failures.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Sync Errors"}
{"instruction":"How is Extended List Price (ELP) calculated for Prepayment charges?","response":"For prepayment charges, there is no proration. The ELP is calculated as the full amount for the validity period.","category":"definitional","topic":"Prepayment"}
{"instruction":"How do we map the Invoice Number for a Credit Memo Item in OTR?","response":"You can map `INV.invoice number` in the billing transaction mapping to a revenue attribute to capture the invoice number for credit memo items.","category":"procedural","topic":"Field Mapping"}
{"instruction":"Does OTR support single version subscriptions?","response":"Yes, OTR supports single version subscriptions. However, there have been reported issues with fields like Product Family or Rev Rec Timing being blank in Booking Transactions for these subscriptions, which may require a fix.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Subscription Management"}
{"instruction":"Can usage revenue be recognized prior to invoicing (Right to Bill)?","response":"Yes. This requires a pure usage charge and a POB template set to 'Consumption Usage (Non-Comitted)'. You must also run the 'Process Usage to Revenue conversion' (Usage Master process) to recognize the revenue prior to billing.","category":"procedural","topic":"Usage Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What are best practices for OTR Data Migration?","response":"Key best practices include: establishing a pre/post-migration reconciliation framework; batching data collection (e.g., 1M-5M records); ensuring accounting codes are unique (duplicates can block backfill); and monitoring for performance (subscriptions take longer than invoices). For testing subsets of data (mocks), consider using the Regenerate API instead of the full Data Migration job.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"How can we update FX rates for an invoice if they were missing during initial generation?","response":"You can use the regenerate API with the parameter `remigrate=true`. This purges the existing booking/billing transactions and rebuilds them, which should pick up the newly available FX rates.","category":"procedural","topic":"Transaction Regeneration"}
{"instruction":"How is the 'Semi-Annual' billing period handled in OTR mapping?","response":"There is a known issue where 'Semi-Annual' may be translated to 'Semi_Annual' (with an underscore). Until fixed, you may need Data Augmentation (DA) rules to handle both value formats.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Billing Period"}
{"instruction":"Can we map custom fields from a Usage record in Billing to Revenue?","response":"Currently, direct mapping of custom fields from usage records to Revenue is not supported. Workarounds include using the revenue upload functionality or deriving values from other available attributes.","category":"definitional","topic":"Usage Mapping"}
{"instruction":"How should we handle duplicate accounting codes blocking OTR backfill?","response":"Duplicate accounting codes (e.g., one active, one inactive with the same name) can cause backfill validation failures. The recommended workaround is to rename the inactive code if possible. A platform enhancement is planned to respect the active/inactive status.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Accounting Codes"}
{"instruction":"How can we create a Product Rate Plan Charge (PRPC) with revenue fields via API?","response":"If the create API does not support revenue fields directly, you can: 1. Set 'Allow Blank Accounting Codes' to Yes; 2. Create the PRPC; 3. Use the `PUT_RevProAccountingCodes` endpoint to set the revenue fields; 4. Revert the 'Allow Blank Accounting Codes' setting.","category":"procedural","topic":"API Usage"}
{"instruction":"Is it recommended to close accounting periods in Zuora Billing for OTR?","response":"Yes, it is highly recommended to close accounting periods in Billing to ensure no transactions are created in closed periods, which facilitates accurate auditing and revenue reconciliation.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Accounting Periods"}
{"instruction":"Which Fixed Amount Discount (FAD) allocation option supports allocation at the FAD-line level?","response":"Option 2 (Generate Actual value in Booking Transaction) or Option 4 (Generate Actual Amount as a Standalone Booking Line) are suitable for line-level allocation. However, Option 2 may have limitations with usage or evergreen subscriptions.","category":"best_practice","topic":"Fixed Amount Discounts"}
{"instruction":"Does data migration include subscriptions created between the cutoff date and the migration run?","response":"Data migration is typically based on a 'From Date'. It generally includes all active and evergreen subscriptions relevant to that start date range.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Migration"}
{"instruction":"Does the regenerate API bring in all versions of a subscription?","response":"The regenerate API brings in 'impacted' SO lines where revenue-impacting fields have changed. If a version change does not affect revenue fields, a corresponding line might not be generated.","category":"definitional","topic":"Transaction Regeneration"}
{"instruction":"Why do Fixed Amount Discount (FAD) revenue dates not update upon cancellation?","response":"FAD revenue dates typically flow blindly from billing or follow the recurring charge. If 'Generate Zero $' is configured, revenue is controlled by invoice items. Cancellation usually results in a Credit Memo rather than an update to the discount line's dates.","category":"definitional","topic":"Fixed Amount Discounts"}
{"instruction":"Are split segments needed if renewals come from an external CPQ (like Salesforce) as amendments?","response":"Yes, split segments are needed. A new term is expected to appear as a separate SO line in Revenue.","category":"definitional","topic":"Split Segments"}
{"instruction":"How are negative unit price usage charges handled in OTR?","response":"Negative unit price usage charges should generally generate an Invoice (INV), but may generate a Credit Memo (CM-C) if the billing item amount is negative. This behavior varies based on the specific scenario.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Usage Revenue"}
{"instruction":"What do AMENDMENT_TYPE values like QTY_I or TERM_D mean in the stage table?","response":"These values indicate the type of amendment trigger: `QTY_I`/`QTY_D` for Quantity Increase/Decrease, `TERM_I`/`TERM_D` for Term changes, and `PRC_I`/`PRC_D` for Price changes.","category":"definitional","topic":"Data Model"}
{"instruction":"Will a renewal line pick up a new account code if it is changed in the Product Catalog?","response":"For existing RPCs, they will typically retain the old account code even for new segments. Only totally new RPCs or Orders will pick up the new code automatically. To update existing lines, a data backfill is required.","category":"procedural","topic":"Account Codes"}
{"instruction":"How are evergreen subscriptions grouped in Revenue?","response":"If the grouping rule is 'Subscription Name + Term Number', evergreen subscriptions (which retain the same term number) are grouped into a single contract. The revenue end date extends based on invoicing.","category":"definitional","topic":"Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction":"Why does a cancellation credit memo sometimes not offset revenue correctly?","response":"If settings like 'Invoice Past End-of-Term' are enabled and a product is billed, a CM-C might be automatically created for the term exceeding the subscription. This behavior is driven by complex interactions between billing rules and revenue recognition settings.","category":"troubleshooting","topic":"Cancellation"}
{"instruction": "How can I ensure consistent invoice amounts when using Delivery-Based Pricing with a specific delivery schedule (e.g., Monday-Saturday)?", "response": "For Delivery-Based Pricing with specific delivery days, the charge's billing period should be set to 'Week' rather than 'Month'. Using 'Month' can result in inconsistent invoice amounts due to the varying number of days or weeks in a month, whereas 'Week' ensures alignment with the weekly delivery schedule.", "category": "Troubleshooting", "topic": "Delivery-Based Pricing"}
{"instruction": "Is there a streamlined way to implement mid-term subscription-level price increases across a large customer base without using CSV uploads?", "response": "Currently, the Batch Price Update widget is best suited for updating one rate plan charge at a time. For updating hundreds of different charges or subscriptions simultaneously, there is no streamlined UI tool available; the recommended approach is to prepare and upload CSV files using the Data Loader tool.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "Batch Price Updates"}
{"instruction": "Who can run an analysis to determine if a tenant requires Performance & Bill Run Enhancement (PBE)?", "response": "The Beehive team (specifically internal contacts like Sidi Zhu) can run an analysis to provide optimization options and identify if PBE is necessary for a specific tenant.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "Performance Analysis"}
{"instruction": "Which customers can be referenced for HighRadius integration with Zuora?", "response": "Zillow and Zoom are referenceable customers using HighRadius integration, specifically for dunning and lockbox payment use cases.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "HighRadius Integration"}
{"instruction": "What are the common solutions for offline provisioning and entitlement management for IoT/Hardware devices?", "response": "Common off-the-shelf vendors include Thales and Flexera. Many enterprise customers build homegrown systems. Platforms like Azure IoT Hub or Kaa often require connectivity and may not support offline provisioning scenarios as effectively.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "IoT Provisioning"}
{"instruction": "How do I set up a demo for Dynamic Usage Charges?", "response": "As Dynamic Usage Charges are currently in an Early Adopter (EA) phase, you should work directly with the Product Manager to ensure the use case is supported and properly configured for a demo.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "Dynamic Usage Charges"}
{"instruction": "What is the best practice for writing off bad debt in Zuora Billing?", "response": "There is no single \"official\" standardized workflow for bad debt write-offs as practices vary by customer and downstream revenue implications. Common approaches include using Credit Memos or specific bad-debt Rate Plan Charges, but the exact method should be aligned with the customer's accounting requirements.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Bad Debt Write-off"}
{"instruction": "Can promo codes be applied directly via the Zuora UI or the initial order payload?", "response": "No, promo codes cannot be applied via the standard UI or a single order payload. The process typically requires three steps: (1) Call the Promo Codes API to validate the code, (2) Call the Promo Codes API to consume/burn the code, and (3) Create the subscription or order with the specific discount rate plan charge appended.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "Promo Codes"}
{"instruction": "What is the refresh interval for the Data Warehouse Connector (e.g., BigQuery)?", "response": "The Data Warehouse Connector currently supports data refreshes on a regular interval, typically every 24 hours. On-demand refresh capabilities are not currently standard.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Data Warehouse Connector"}
{"instruction": "How is Insurance typically modeled in Zuora regarding term length and risk factors?", "response": "Insurance calculations (premiums based on age, risk, term) are typically performed outside of Zuora in a specialized policy platform. The final calculated premium is then passed to Zuora as a flat fee or price. While Attribute-Based Pricing exists, complex actuarial math is usually kept external.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Insurance Modeling"}
{"instruction": "How can I simulate payment failures in a demo or test environment?", "response": "Most test gateways provide specific credit card numbers or dollar amounts that trigger hard or soft declines. For the internal Zuora Test Gateway, specific \"magic words\" or values are documented to simulate various failure response codes.", "category": "Troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment Failure Simulation"}
{"instruction": "Can Heroku be used as an integration layer between Zuora and Salesforce instead of the managed connector?", "response": "Yes, building an app on Heroku to act as middleware is a valid architectural pattern. It allows for custom handling of events and data sync to Salesforce custom objects, avoiding the API limits or specific constraints of the out-of-the-box Zuora 360 managed package.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Integration Architecture"}
{"instruction": "How should I model a \"markup\" option plan that is a percentage of a basic plan?", "response": "Zuora does not natively support a charge model that automatically calculates a percentage markup of another independent product's price. The recommended best practice is to calculate the markup amount in the upstream CRM or ordering system and pass it to Zuora as a flat fee.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Percentage Uplift Charges"}
{"instruction": "Can the 40-character limit for the City field in Contacts be increased?", "response": "No, the character limit for standard contact fields like City is not configurable. Increasing it requires a platform product change.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Contact Field Limits"}
{"instruction": "Does Attribute Based Pricing (ABP) automatically re-evaluate prices when a custom field changes during a subscription amendment?", "response": "No, ABP typically evaluates pricing at the time of the Order creation. Simply changing a custom field on the subscription or account mid-cycle does not automatically trigger a re-rating of existing recurring charges unless a specific order action forces a re-evaluation.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Attribute Based Pricing"}
{"instruction": "How can I open multiple OneID tenants simultaneously?", "response": "Since OneID manages the session at the browser level, you must use different browser profiles (e.g., Chrome Profiles) or a feature like Firefox Multi-Account Containers to maintain separate active sessions for different tenants at the same time.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "OneID Management"}
{"instruction": "How many levels of taxation does Z-Tax support?", "response": "Z-Tax supports up to three levels of taxation (e.g., Federal, State, Local) per transaction line.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Z-Tax"}
{"instruction": "Can Zuora Tax calculate a tax on top of a total that already includes GST (Tax on Tax)?", "response": "Generally, Zuora Tax calculates taxes based on the line subtotal. To support \"tax on tax\" or stacked taxes (e.g., a surcharge on top of GST), you typically configure the second tax as a separate tax code applied to the base amount, or use an external tax engine if complex compounding logic is required.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Tax Configuration"}
{"instruction": "What are the key changes to Zuora Billing API versioning introduced in late 2024?", "response": "Zuora moved from numbered API versions (e.g., 186.0) to date-based versioning (e.g., 2024-05-20). Additionally, a new \"API Versioning\" setting in the admin console allows you to view and upgrade the tenant's default API version.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "API Versioning"}
{"instruction": "Is there a pre-built GL Connector for Microsoft Business Central?", "response": "There is no specific named connector for Business Central. You would typically use the \"Configurable Summary GL Connector\" to generate a CSV file which can then be ingested by Business Central, or build a custom integration.", "category": "architectural", "topic": "GL Connectors"}
{"instruction": "Can Salesforce CPQ and Zuora CPQ coexist in the same Salesforce environment?", "response": "Yes, they can coexist, typically by bifurcating the quoting flows (separate buttons). Data conflict on shared objects like `Product2` must be managed, noting that the modern Zuora 360+ sync allows for more granular control over object syncing to avoid conflicts.", "category": "architectural", "topic": "CPQ Co-existence"}
{"instruction": "How can I generate invoices in two different languages for the same customer?", "response": "Zuora's standard multi-lingual support generates an invoice in the single language defined by the account's locale. To support two languages simultaneously (e.g., a bilingual invoice), you typically need to create a custom HTML template that hardcodes labels in both languages, rather than relying solely on the locale setting.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Invoice Templates"}
{"instruction": "Does a customer expanding to a new region (e.g., EU from Japan) need a new tenant?", "response": "Often yes, especially if there are distinct requirements for data residency, currency, accounting rules, or ERP integrations. While Multi-Entity is the standard solution for managing multiple business units, separate tenants are required if data must physically reside in a different data center.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Multi-Org Architecture"}
{"instruction": "How can I enable proration for only specific charges in the catalog?", "response": "You can enable \"Charge Level Proration\" under Billing Settings > Manage Features. This allows you to define proration rules at the individual charge level rather than globally.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "Proration Settings"}
{"instruction": "Can Zuora prorate charges by hour?", "response": "No, the Zuora rating engine calculates proration based on days. Hourly proration requires custom calculations (e.g., passing the pre-calculated rated amount via API).", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Proration Granularity"}
{"instruction": "How can a customer A/B test Smart Retry vs CPR?", "response": "Since payment methods aren't attached at invoice generation, random splitting is difficult. A common approach is to define cohorts using Customer Groups or custom fields on the Account, and then configure the retry logic to apply different strategies to those specific groups.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Smart Retry Testing"}
{"instruction": "What is the advantage of using a Developer Sandbox (DSBX) over an API Sandbox with Deployment Manager?", "response": "A Developer Sandbox (DSBX) created via \"Refresh from Prod\" creates an exact replica of the production configuration and settings instantly. Deployment Manager requires manual setup and may not cover every single configuration setting, making DSBX a more reliable \"reset button\" for testing.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Sandbox Strategy"}
{"instruction": "How does Overage Smoothing work with a Prepaid Drawdown charge model?", "response": "Prepaid Drawdown takes precedence; the system consumes the prepaid balance first. Overage Smoothing logic applies only to the usage that exceeds the prepaid balance (the true overage).", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Usage Smoothing"}
{"instruction": "Can I build a Billing Preview report directly in Zuora Reporting/Analytics?", "response": "Not out-of-the-box. Billing Preview data is accessible via API or Developer Tools. To report on it in Analytics, you typically need to use a Data Query or Workflow to fetch the preview data and store it in a custom object or export it for external reporting.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "Billing Preview Reporting"}
{"instruction": "How can I handle an overpayment without issuing a refund?", "response": "An overpayment sits as a credit balance (liability). To clear it without refunding, you must apply it to a debit. This can be done by generating the next invoice early and applying the credit, or by creating a Debit Memo (though this may have accounting implications).", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Overpayment Handling"}
{"instruction": "Can I retrieve raw credit card (PAN) data from Zuora to migrate to another provider?", "response": "No, Zuora does not expose raw PAN data via API due to PCI compliance standards. Exceptions for raw data extraction are extremely rare, require strict indemnification, and are handled via a specialized professional services engagement, not self-service.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment Data Portability"}
{"instruction": "Can I modify a subscription while it is in 'Pending' status?", "response": "Historically, modifying pending subscriptions has been limited. Enhancements are on the roadmap (targeted for late 2024/early 2025) to allow cancellation or modification of pending orders. Currently, it is best practice to manage the order in an external system (CRM) and only push to Zuora once finalized.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Pending Subscriptions"}
{"instruction": "How does the new Salesforce 360+ Connector differ from the legacy version?", "response": "The new Salesforce 360+ connector (Billing connector for Salesforce CPQ) offers improved performance and granular control over which objects are synced, allowing admins to reduce data volume usage in Salesforce.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Salesforce Connector"}
{"instruction": "Is there a recorded demo for CPQ X?", "response": "Yes, recorded demos and Saleo capture assets for CPQ X are available on Highspot for internal use.", "category": "general", "topic": "CPQ X Demo"}
{"instruction": "How do I manage a Staging environment connected to an external system when refreshing the sandbox breaks ID mappings?", "response": "Refreshing a Zuora sandbox changes the internal IDs, breaking mappings with external static staging environments. Best practice is to either treat the sandbox as a long-lived tenant (avoiding refresh) or build automation to re-seed/re-map the sandbox data from the external system immediately after a refresh.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Environment Management"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between MRR Forecast in Billing and Revenue Booking-based RevRec?", "response": "The MRR Forecast in Billing is a non-GAAP projection of recurring revenue. Zuora Revenue's Booking-based RevRec provides a compliant ASC606/IFRS15 view that includes allocations, standalone selling price (SSP), and one-time fees, which the billing forecast does not cover.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Revenue Forecasting"}
{"instruction": "How can I check a customer's feature usage (e.g., custom objects) without logging into their tenant?", "response": "You can use the internal 'Cerebro' tool to look up the account and view the 'Entitlements' or 'Trends' tab, which displays usage metrics.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "Internal Tooling"}
{"instruction": "Does Zuora support a B2B2C 'Bill on Behalf Of' model?", "response": "Yes, Zuora can support this using Customer Hierarchy features (separating Invoice Owner and Subscription Owner). It requires detailed discovery to map out liability, invoice delivery, and payment responsibility.", "category": "architectural", "topic": "B2B2C Billing"}
{"instruction": "How can I mass activate currencies for a new product?", "response": "There is no UI button to mass activate currencies. You can use a Workflow to query the ProductRatePlan IDs and iteratively call the API to enable the desired currencies for each plan.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Currency Management"}
{"instruction": "What causes the 'Fail to find a matching Charge Definition' error in Attribute Based Pricing?", "response": "This error typically occurs if the underlying Product Charge Definition has a NULL end date. Updating the charge definition with a valid far-future end date via API often resolves the issue.", "category": "Troubleshooting", "topic": "Attribute Based Pricing"}
{"instruction": "Why should a customer use Zuora for Accounts Receivable instead of their ERP (e.g., NetSuite)?", "response": "Using Zuora for AR allows for a 'Subledger' approach where Billing and Revenue data remain the source of truth, simplifying the ERP integration to just summary Journal Entries. It avoids the complexity of reconciling two systems and prevents the rigidity of ERP logic from hindering pricing and packaging agility.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Zuora vs ERP for AR"}
{"instruction": "What is the feedback on the JP Morgan (Chase) Payment Gateway?", "response": "Feedback is generally mixed to negative due to the difficulty of working with their support structure and legacy infrastructure. Modern gateways like Stripe or Adyen are often recommended alternatives for a smoother integration experience.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction": "Can I use AQuA in a Dev tenant to save costs while using Snowflake Secure Data Share in Prod?", "response": "While possible, it is not recommended because AQuA and Snowflake Secure Data Share use different data models and formats. Queries built for AQuA in Dev will not be portable to Prod, negating the testing value.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Snowflake Integration"}
{"instruction": "Does Zuora integrate with Microsoft Power Platform?", "response": "Integration is possible (e.g., AIMS360 uses it), but there have been historical compatibility issues regarding Microsoft's handling of OpenAPI 3.0 recursive calls.", "category": "architectural", "topic": "Microsoft Power Platform"}
{"instruction": "Why does cancelling a One-Time Charge (OTC) not generate a credit?", "response": "To credit back a One-Time Charge, the cancellation effective date must match the charge's original start date. If the dates do not match, the system assumes the charge was valid for that period and may not issue a credit.", "category": "Troubleshooting", "topic": "One-Time Charges"}
{"instruction": "How can I apply a minimum charge based on the aggregate of multiple usage records?", "response": "Standard Minimum Commit works per billing period. To enforce a minimum per transaction or hour across aggregated usage, you would likely need to use the Mediation (Rating Processor) engine with custom aggregation logic before the data reaches the rating engine.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Usage Rating"}
{"instruction": "How do I manage a ramp deal with changing prices over time?", "response": "Ramp deals can be managed using the Ramp Deal feature in Orders or by creating multi-period Rate Plan Charges with effective dates that align with the price changes. Misalignment of amendment dates with charge segments can cause billing errors.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "Ramp Deals"}
{"instruction": "Is there a pre-built connector for PeopleSoft Finance?", "response": "No, there is no pre-built connector. Integration is typically achieved via a generic summary Journal Entry export (GL Connector) or a custom middleware integration.", "category": "architectural", "topic": "ERP Integration"}

{"instruction": "What are common use cases for the \"Minimum Commitment\" or \"Percentage of Spend\" revenue models?", "response": "Common use cases include manufacturing scenarios or B2B contracts where maintenance and support costs are calculated as a percentage of total spend (e.g., a 10% support fee added to usage). Another prominent use case involves threshold notifications at the account level, where actions are triggered when a customer's aggregated usage across multiple subscriptions reaches a certain daily or monthly limit.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Revenue Models"}
{"instruction": "How can customers perform bulk amendments if they do not have the Developer Tools (Mass Order Entry) feature?", "response": "If Developer Tools are not available, customers can use the standard Data Loader. While the specific \"Amendment\" data dictionary template might be missing from some documentation, the object is supported. Alternatively, customers can use the \"Orders - Charge Overrides\" template in Data Loader to perform add-product or update-product actions in bulk, though this template may require enablement via a support request.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Data Loader"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between the \"% Charge Model\" and the \"Commitment Spend Model\"?", "response": "The \"% Charge Model\" (or % of Spend) is a pricing model where the charge amount is calculated as a percentage of another billed amount, typically tied to usage or overall spend (e.g., a 10% support fee on a $100k bill). The \"Commitment Spend Model\" is a contractual agreement where a customer commits to spending a minimum amount over a period (e.g., $2M/year). Actual charges are tracked against this commitment, and a true-up is invoiced if the minimum is not met.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Revenue Models"}
{"instruction": "Is the Zuora Secure Data Share for Snowflake bi-directional?", "response": "No, the Zuora Secure Data Share for Snowflake is a one-way sync from Zuora to the customer's Snowflake account. It does not support pushing data from Snowflake back into Zuora.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Snowflake Connector"}
{"instruction": "What are the benefits of vaulting payment methods in Zuora compared to an external gateway?", "response": "The primary benefit of vaulting payment methods within Zuora is gateway flexibility. It allows you to route payments to different gateways based on business rules without requiring the customer to re-enter payment details. However, teams should consider localization requirements when deciding on a vaulting strategy.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Payments"}
{"instruction": "What is the best practice for handling B2C invoices in Canada that need to be in both English and French?", "response": "The recommended approach is to capture the customer's language preference upfront and then assign a localized Communication Profile and Invoice Template based on that preference. This avoids the need to create complex, cluttered templates that attempt to display both languages simultaneously.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Invoicing"}
{"instruction": "How should contract PDFs be managed when integrating Zuora with a Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) system?", "response": "The recommended best practice is for the upstream system (e.g., a webapp or CPQ) to store the generated contract PDF directly into the CLM system and simply create the subscription in Zuora. It is generally not efficient to attach the PDF to the Zuora subscription object solely for the purpose of archiving it to a CLM later.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Integration"}
{"instruction": "Which data objects are available via Zuora Secure Data Share for Snowflake?", "response": "The Secure Data Share typically includes Billing objects. Objects such as Revenue Schedule, Revenue Event, and Chart of Accounts are technically part of the Finance/Revenue domain within Zuora Billing and are available for sync, though some specific objects may require explicit opt-in configuration.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Snowflake Connector"}
{"instruction": "How can a customer offer an annual commitment with monthly payments?", "response": "This can be achieved using Payment Schedules. The subscription is configured with an annual term and annual charges (ensuring the commitment is recognized), while a Payment Schedule is set up to break the collection of that total amount into monthly installments.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Billing"}
{"instruction": "How should external payments (e.g., processed in SAP) store identifying information in Zuora?", "response": "The best practice is to use a custom field on the Payment object to store the external transaction ID or reference number. While the `second_reference_id` field is an option, a dedicated custom field is often cleaner. Note that the standard `number` field on the Payment object typically cannot be overridden via API.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Payments"}
{"instruction": "Can Power BI connect directly to Zuora without a Data Warehouse?", "response": "Power BI is a visualization tool that typically requires a database or data warehouse source. While it cannot connect \"directly\" to Zuora's transactional engine in the same way it connects to a SQL DB, customers can use a Zuora Data Warehouse Connector (e.g., for Snowflake or SQL Server) to stage the data, or export Zuora data (via Data Query) into a local database that Power BI can query.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Analytics"}
{"instruction": "Why does the Salesforce CPQ Connector force a cancel/rebook (debook/rebook) for amendments?", "response": "Salesforce CPQ's architecture typically handles changes by adding new quote lines, whereas Zuora modifies existing subscriptions via versioning. To align these disparate models and ensure accurate proration and downstream ERP revenue recognition, the connector often utilizes a cancel/rebook methodology rather than a native amendment update.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction": "How can a customer upgrade their Zuora 360 or Zuora Quotes managed packages in Salesforce?", "response": "Customers can obtain the latest installation links by opening a support ticket or checking the relevant CPQ community channels. The upgrade involves appending the installation URL to their Salesforce environment domain. It is strongly recommended to test the upgrade in a sandbox environment first to ensure compatibility with existing customizations.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction": "How can performance issues with large quotes (e.g., >50 lines) be addressed in Zuora CPQ?", "response": "Performance for large quotes can be improved by enabling the Asynchronous Order Call setting in Quote Studio. This offloads the processing load and prevents timeouts in the UI during the submission process.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "CPQ"}
{"instruction": "How can unbilled usage data be exposed to a customer portal?", "response": "Unbilled usage can be retrieved by querying the `RatingResult` table via API or Data Source Export. You can filter by the `status` field (looking for \"rated\" but not yet \"billed\" items) to display current consumption to customers before an invoice is generated.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Usage"}
{"instruction": "How can discounts be applied sequentially (e.g., 20% off, then 10% off the remainder) rather than stacked?", "response": "This logic can be handled using Discount Classes. By assigning discounts to different classes and defining the application order, you can ensure that subsequent discounts are applied to the net amount remaining after previous discounts, rather than summing the discount percentages.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Pricing"}
{"instruction": "Can the Data Warehouse Connector synchronization be forced manually?", "response": "No, synchronization is automated based on the configured latency. Standard connectors typically sync every 12 or 24 hours. The Snowflake connector offers higher frequency options (up to every 5 minutes) for an additional cost, but manual triggering is not a standard feature.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Data Warehouse"}
{"instruction": "Why does a connector stop working if the user who configured it changes roles?", "response": "Connectors often run using the authentication credentials of the user who initially authenticated them. If that user's permissions are downgraded or their account is deactivated, the connector will fail. Best practice is to create a dedicated Integration/System User with the necessary permissions and use those credentials to authenticate connectors.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Connectors"}
{"instruction": "What should be checked if Bill Runs are taking longer than reported in Grafana?", "response": "If Bill Runs appear to be taking longer than the execution times shown in Grafana dashboards, check the Tax Connector Health or tax calculation process. Latency or timeouts from an external tax engine (e.g., Vertex, Sovos) can extend the total processing time significantly without always appearing as \"Bill Run\" processing time.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Performance"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between Multi-Org and Multi-Entity in Zuora?", "response": "Multi-Org provides virtual data barriers within a single tenant instance, allowing for shared configurations like products and accounting periods. Multi-Entity establishes physical data barriers, effectively creating unique environments (tenants) that do not share configurations by default, though they can be linked in a hierarchy.", "category": "comparison", "topic": "Architecture"}
{"instruction": "Can a single Payment Schedule be associated with multiple invoices?", "response": "Yes, it is possible to associate a single Payment Schedule with multiple invoices, but this functionality is currently supported only via the API and is not available in the UI.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Billing"}
{"instruction": "How can e-signature be handled when using the HubSpot Connector?", "response": "A common approach is to build a workflow in HubSpot that updates a specific field (like \"Customer Acceptance Date\") on the Deal object once the signature is collected. Syncing this update to Zuora can then trigger the activation of the Order (which is initially created in a \"Pending Activation\" state).", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "HubSpot Integration"}
{"instruction": "How often does the data in the Command Center (OneID) dashboard refresh?", "response": "The Command Center dashboard data refreshes approximately every 24 hours. It is not a real-time view of tenant metrics.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Command Center"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended provisioning flow for services based on Zuora subscriptions?", "response": "The recommended flow is: 1) Submit the subscription to Zuora. 2) Use a callout or workflow to notify the provisioning system. 3) Once the external system confirms provisioning is complete, trigger an update to activate the subscription in Zuora.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Provisioning"}
{"instruction": "How can customers check their current status of a Prepaid Drawdown balance?", "response": "Customers can query the prepaid balance status using the `queryPrepaidBalanceFundByKey` API to see the current fund level, and `queryPrepaidBalanceTransactions` to view the history of usage against that fund.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "APIs"}
{"instruction": "Should the same Salesforce API user be used for both Zuora 360 Sync and Custom Workflows?", "response": "No, it is best practice to use distinct API users for different integrations. This ensures clear audit trails and allows permissions to be scoped specifically to the needs of each integration (e.g., 360 Sync may require different access than a custom workflow).", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Security"}
{"instruction": "Can a Central Sandbox (CSBX) refresh be configured to include only specific data?", "response": "No, Central Sandbox refreshes are typically full copies of the Production environment's data and configuration. There is no native option to select a partial data set for the refresh.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Environment Management"}
{"instruction": "What are good use cases for Zuora Custom Logic?", "response": "Custom Logic is excellent for implementing data validation rules to prevent downstream errors. Examples include validating email formats, restricting special characters in text fields, or enforcing field character limits to ensure compatibility with ERPs like NetSuite.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Custom Logic"}
{"instruction": "Is the Snowflake Secure Data Share connector included in Sandbox environments if licensed for Production?", "response": "No, the Snowflake Secure Data Share connector is licensed per environment. Having it in Production does not automatically grant access in Sandbox; a separate license or provisioning is required due to the costs associated with the secure share.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Snowflake Connector"}
{"instruction": "Why might Invoice FX (Foreign Exchange) data be missing from data source exports?", "response": "If Invoice FX data is missing, check if the \"Reporting Currencies\" feature (T9 setting) is enabled for the tenant. This feature is often required to expose the relevant FX transaction tables for reporting.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Reporting"}
{"instruction": "What is the data retention period for Grafana data (specifically API metrics), and why might queries return no results?", "response": "The data retention period for Grafana (which runs off the Pinot database) is approximately 90 to 100 days. Users attempting to query metrics or API volume beyond this 100-day window will likely see no results returned.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Grafana Data Retention"}
{"instruction": "Is there an upper limit to the number of records allowed in a Dynamic Pricing Decision Table?", "response": "While there is no strict upper limit enforced by the system, successful testing has been conducted up to 1,000 rows with 10 attributes. Exceeding this number (specifically beyond 10,000 cells) may result in errors from ZRules. For tables of that size, it is recommended to reevaluate the complexity of the pricing model to simplify it.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Dynamic Pricing"}
{"instruction": "Does purchasing the Multi-Org (MO) entitlement for Billing automatically include or require Multi-Org for Revenue?", "response": "No, Multi-Org (MO) for Billing does not necessitate MO for Revenue. They are technically and commercially different entitlements with distinct goals. A customer can have MO for Billing enabled without enabling it for Revenue.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Multi-Org"}
{"instruction": "Which payment gateways currently support Giro or AvtaleGiro payment methods for Norway?", "response": "Currently, these methods are not natively supported by most major gateways in Zuora. GoCardless supports Autogiro for Sweden. For AvtaleGiro in Norway, it may be possible to support it through Adyen as a pseudo Credit Card Reference Transaction, but this is considered a workaround and is not officially supported.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction": "What are the performance benchmarks for Performance Booster Elite (PBE) regarding high-volume invoice generation?", "response": "Benchmarks indicate PBE can process approximately 2 million invoices in 5 hours for simple subscriptions (1 subscription with 1 rate plan). Complex subscriptions will lower performance. For extremely high volumes (e.g., 20 million invoices), it is recommended to distribute the load (e.g., via anniversary billing) or spread the bill run over 2-3 days rather than attempting a single-day run.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Performance Booster Elite"}
{"instruction": "Is there a limit to the number of payment gateway instances (e.g., multiple merchant IDs) that can be configured in a single Zuora tenant?", "response": "Zuora typically gates the number of unique gateway types (e.g., Adyen vs. Stripe) based on the contract, not the number of specific instances. It is technically possible to configure a large number (up to thousands) of instances of the same gateway type (e.g., 150+ Adyen merchant IDs) within a single tenant.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payment Gateways"}
{"instruction": "How do I install and configure the Zuora MCP server for use with LLM tools like Claude Desktop or Cursor?", "response": "To install the Zuora MCP server: 1) Install the 'zuora-mcp' package using npm. 2) Configure your tool (e.g., edit the configuration file for Claude) to include the 'mcpServers' definition with your BASE_URL, ZUORA_CLIENT_ID, and ZUORA_CLIENT_SECRET. 3) Restart the application (ensuring the process is fully stopped via Activity Monitor if needed). The server works with tools supporting MCP integration but may require specific personal licenses for tools like ChatGPT.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Developer Tools"}
{"instruction": "How can I obtain a definition of the Zuora tables and fields pushed to Snowflake to perform a fit-gap analysis?", "response": "A recommended approach is to use a demo or OTR instance to display the data in Snowflake and simultaneously perform an export on the corresponding object in Zuora. Comparing these outputs allows for verification of field definitions and types.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Snowflake Integration"}
{"instruction": "Why would the 'Credit Memo' data source be unavailable in Reporting for a user with full permissions?", "response": "The 'Credit Memo' data source is only available if the tenant has Invoice Settlement (IS) enabled. If the customer is not on Invoice Settlement, there are no credit memos to report on, and the data source will not appear in the reporting interface.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Reporting"}
{"instruction": "What does 'maintenance mode' mean for the Subscribe and Amend (S&A) APIs, and what is the recommended path forward?", "response": "'Maintenance mode' means the feature is not End of Life (EOL) yet, but only critical, revenue-impacting defects with no workarounds will be fixed. New features will not be added to these APIs. The recommended path is to transition to Orders Harmonization to access newer features and modern APIs.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "API Lifecycle"}
{"instruction": "Can the 'Single Version Subscription' feature be enabled on a tenant that already has existing versioned subscriptions?", "response": "No, currently the Single Version Subscription feature cannot be enabled for tenants with existing versioned subscriptions. It requires a clean environment. Support for existing tenants is targeted for a future release (estimated Q2-Q3 2026). To test this feature, you must request enablement in a clean sandbox via a support ticket.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Subscription Management"}
{"instruction": "Are Payment Links, Payment Forms, and Payment Pages mutually exclusive, and are they all PCI compliant?", "response": "No, they are not mutually exclusive; a customer can implement all three simultaneously for different use cases (e.g., Links for ad-hoc payments, Forms/Pages for sign-up flows). All three options are PCI compliant and secure.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Payments"}
{"instruction": "Does Zuora offer a native connector for Informatica?", "response": "No, Zuora has not built a native connector for Informatica.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Integrations"}
{"instruction": "Does sending mediation data to external targets (Amazon S3, Snowflake, Kafka) incur additional costs?", "response": "Yes, using targets that take data out of Zuora's systems (like Customer's Kafka or Snowflake) will add to data transfer costs. While the base charge is typically based on the number of events ingested, data egress to external targets incurs additional fees and may require Engineering setup.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Mediation"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended approach for billing Professional Services (T&M vs. Milestone) in Zuora?", "response": "For Time & Materials (T&M), the recommended approach is to use the Usage model (consumption billing) to track hours burned. For Milestone-based billing, using Order Line Items (OLI) or Invoice Schedules is often preferred. Note that Usage models may require custom fields or Prepaid Drawdown to capture upfront booking metrics properly in Revenue.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Professional Services Billing"}
{"instruction": "How can I verify if a customer is actively using Hosted Payment Method (HPM) pages?", "response": "You can verify HPM usage by checking telemetry data (e.g., Grafana) for calls to the 'POST /v1/rsa-signatures' API. Successful execution of this API indicates the customer is generating the signatures required for HPM or Payment Form implementation.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payments"}
{"instruction": "How should gateway options be configured for Ecommerce transactions versus Recurring transactions?", "response": "The gateway should typically be set to 'Recurring' by default. For Ecommerce transactions, you must override the gateway options on the Order API to flag the transaction type explicitly (e.g., as 'Ecommerce') to ensure high authorization rates and correct processing.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Payments"}
{"instruction": "What is a recommended technical approach for implementing custom dunning logic (suspend/resume/cancel) in Zuora?", "response": "A common best practice is to utilize the Workflow engine to run a batch job that retrieves all open, unprocessed invoices. The workflow sorts these invoices into aging buckets and triggers the appropriate actions (suspend, cancel, etc.) based on the age. A parallel workflow should handle 'cleanup' by identifying invoices that have been paid and resuming the account.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Dunning"}
{"instruction": "What changes were made to the permissions for the Events & Notifications API in the Q3 2025 release?", "response": "For compliance and security, API calls for Events & Notifications (which were previously available to multiple roles) are now restricted by default to users with the Platform Admin role. Users without this role will encounter errors when attempting to modify these settings via API.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Security"}
{"instruction": "How should orders containing both physical hardware and software subscriptions be handled?", "response": "The recommended approach is to bifurcate the order upstream (e.g., at the POS or Order Management system). The hardware portion should be routed to the fulfillment system, while only the software subscription/warranty portion is sent to Zuora. Zuora does not typically handle the physical fulfillment logic for hardware.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "Order Management"}
{"instruction": "How can I migrate a subscription in the middle of a billing period without generating a new invoice for the already-paid period?", "response": "Use the 'Catch-up Bill Run' feature. Load the subscription with its original start date (or start of the last term). Then, execute a catch-up bill run targeting the *next* planned billing date. This sets the 'Billed Through Date' forward to that date without generating a Zuora invoice or requiring a credit memo for the historical period.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Data Migration"}
{"instruction": "What is the process for upgrading from the legacy Zuora 360 Sync to the new Zuora Connector for Salesforce?", "response": "The migration process involves: 1) Requesting Support to enable the 'Object Enablement' page. 2) Navigating to Settings > Commerce > Sync Object Enablement and selecting the specific objects to sync (optimizing for only necessary objects to manage API load). 3) Submitting a support ticket to finalize the cutover. Be aware that the new sync is optimized for latency but may consume more SFDC API calls.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Salesforce Integration"}
{"instruction": "Can a single customer account in Zuora support multiple currencies?", "response": "Yes, using the 'Multiple Currencies' feature, a single account can hold subscriptions in different currencies. However, the account-level default currency cannot be changed once set. Enabling this requires careful consideration of downstream impacts on billing, payments, and reporting.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Multi-Currency"}
{"instruction": "Are Payment Schedules compatible with the 'Multiple Currencies' feature?", "response": "No, Payment Schedules are listed as a limitation when the 'Multiple Currencies' feature (allowing different currencies on a single account) is enabled. However, Payment Schedules are compatible with standard multi-currency usage where different accounts use different single currencies.", "category": "troubleshooting", "topic": "Payment Schedules"}
{"instruction": "Does Zuora offer a supported connector or managed package for Microsoft Dynamics 365?", "response": "No, Zuora previously offered a connector but it has been rolled back and is no longer available. There is no official managed package for Microsoft Dynamics 365. Integration must be built via APIs or using a generic middleware solution.", "category": "definitional", "topic": "Integrations"}
{"instruction": "Can Amendments be processed using the Zuora Data Loader?", "response": "Yes, Amendments are supported in Data Loader, though the specific Data Dictionary for them may not be visible by default and might need to be requested. Alternatively, users can use the Orders template within Data Loader to perform actions like adding products or charge overrides, which is often the recommended modern approach.", "category": "procedural", "topic": "Data Loader"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended strategy for migrating Zuora CPQ configurations and metadata when splitting a Salesforce instance (e.g., divestiture)?", "response": "There is no native 'clone and purge' functionality to move Zuora CPQ data between Salesforce production organizations. The recommended approach is to treat it like a new implementation or use Salesforce deployment tools (like Copado) to migrate configurations and metadata. Detailed data tagging is critical for migrating accounts and contacts correctly.", "category": "best_practice", "topic": "CPQ Migration"}
{"instruction": "How can issue-based revenue recognition be handled for Media customers (e.g., weekly issues, extra issues)?", "response": "For issue-based revenue recognition, such as with weekly media publications, it is recommended to either upload a schedule of 'delivery dates' or utilize a consumption-based model. In this model, the delivery of the issue serves as the trigger for revenue recognition.", "category": "Best Practice", "topic": "Issue-Based Revenue"}
{"instruction": "What is the recommended approach for handling large volume data extractions for BI3 Views if the API is too slow?", "response": "For large volume extractions where the standard API is insufficient (e.g., exceeding 20 million lines or experiencing timeouts), it is recommended to use the BI3 extract COE program or leverage Zuora Secure Data Share (Snowflake) for more efficient data retrieval.", "category": "Best Practice", "topic": "Data Extraction"}
{"instruction": "What are the benchmarks and recommendations for switching from SFTP to API for data ingestion?", "response": "API provisioning is generally recommended over SFTP for modern integrations. The current benchmark for APIs is approximately 1 million transactions/lines per push. APIs support ingesting transactions with file iterations in parallel. For extremely high volumes, checking outbound limitations is also advised.", "category": "Best Practice", "topic": "Integration Methods"}
{"instruction": "How can the Long Term/Short Term (LTST) reclassification journal be disabled?", "response": "To stop the LTST reclassification, the specific job should be unscheduled or not run. However, users must ensure that the final reversal journal occurs if the process was previously in use. If the requirement is related to netting, that specific configuration may need to be disabled.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "LTST Journal"}
{"instruction": "Does the K2 integration between Zuora Billing and Revenue support evergreen subscriptions?", "response": "Yes, the K2 integration supports evergreen subscriptions, but with specific ground rules. Typically, this requires that no revenue allocation is performed and revenue recognition is based on billing (e.g., 'Upon Billing') to avoid complexities with Contractual Contract Value (CCV) calculations.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Evergreen Subscriptions"}
{"instruction": "How is the Unit Sell Price calculated in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "The Unit Sell Price is calculated using the formula: Extended Sell Price divided by Quantity divided by Term (Ext Sell Price / Qty / Term).", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Formulas"}
{"instruction": "How can the 'Refresh Sandbox' menu be enabled in the Zuora Revenue UI?", "response": "The 'Refresh Sandbox' menu is controlled by a specific profile option named 'Refresh Sandbox'. This profile must be enabled for the option to appear in the user interface.", "category": "Troubleshooting", "topic": "Sandbox Management"}
{"instruction": "How does the Zuora Revenue to Workday connector handle journal balancing?", "response": "Zuora Revenue ensures that journal entries are balanced (Total Debits equal Total Credits) before sending them. The Workday connector will not post unbalanced journals. The journals contain both Ledger Accounts and Revenue Categories (Worktags).", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Workday Connector"}
{"instruction": "Why might a line be missing from the Waterfall Report even if it belongs to the selected period?", "response": "A line may be excluded from the Waterfall Report if it has been fully amortized/recognized in a prior period and the system's profile setting for retaining fully amortized lines has caused it to drop off. Duplicate lines in the report can occur if multiple Revenue or Deferred segments exist for a single line.", "category": "Troubleshooting", "topic": "Reporting Discrepancies"}
{"instruction": "Can Zuora Revenue reports be triggered automatically by system events (e.g., data arrival)?", "response": "No, there is currently no functionality to trigger reports based on system events or data arrival hooks. Reports must be run either ad-hoc or on a time-based schedule.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Report Scheduling"}
{"instruction": "How should Termination for Convenience (TFC) clauses be handled regarding revenue allocation?", "response": "For contracts with TFC clauses (e.g., a 12-month contract cancellable after 3 months), best practice is often to limit the revenue allocation to the guaranteed term (e.g., the first 3 months). This can be managed by booking the initial guaranteed term and treating subsequent periods as renewals, though specific handling depends on auditor requirements.", "category": "Best Practice", "topic": "Revenue Allocation"}
{"instruction": "Is there a limit on the number of transaction lines in a Revenue Contract (RC)?", "response": "There is no hard system limit on the number of lines in an RC, but performance issues (such as slow loading times when opening the RC in the Workbench) typically arise when an RC exceeds 500 to 1,000 lines.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "System Limits"}
{"instruction": "Can a single Zuora Billing entity be mapped to multiple Zuora Revenue organizations?", "response": "No, mapping a single Billing entity to multiple Revenue organizations is a custom requirement and not supported out-of-the-box. Doing so can create significant data gaps, such as issues with functional currency alignment.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Multi-Org Configuration"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between 'Before Validate' and 'Before Bundle Explode' stages in Data Augmentation?", "response": "'Before Validate' runs data augmentation logic before the system performs validation on the source data. 'Before Bundle Explode' runs after validation is complete but before the bundle explosion process occurs; this stage is useful for copying attributes from a parent bundle line to its children to avoid duplication of effort.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Data Augmentation"}
{"instruction": "Does Zuora Revenue support booking in one currency and invoicing in another for the same transaction?", "response": "No, Zuora Revenue requires that the booking (sales order) and the billing (invoice) for a transaction be in the same transactional currency to ensure proper reconciliation and accounting.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Currency Support"}
{"instruction": "Does Zuora Revenue support multiple reporting currencies within a single organization?", "response": "No, Zuora Revenue does not support multiple reporting currencies within a single organization. It typically supports one functional currency and one reporting currency per organization.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Currency Support"}
{"instruction": "What is the best practice for handling subscription cancellations in Billing to ensure correct flow to Revenue?", "response": "The best practice is to perform a Bill Run after the cancellation to generate the necessary credit memos or invoice reversals within Billing. This ensures the cancellation flows to Revenue as a transaction (e.g., CM-C) rather than relying on manual write-offs, which may not trigger the correct revenue reversal logic (CM-RO).", "category": "Best Practice", "topic": "Cancellations"}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between Order to Revenue (OTR) and the K2 integration?", "response": "K2 is the legacy integration framework between Zuora Billing and Revenue, which is no longer receiving new feature enhancements. Order to Revenue (OTR) is the current standard integration that supports newer features (like Attribute Based Pricing and Multi-Currency) and addresses gaps present in K2.", "category": "Comparison", "topic": "Integration Types"}
{"instruction": "Are General Ledger (GL) codes mandatory input fields for data loaded into Zuora Revenue?", "response": "Yes, GL codes are typically mandatory inputs. They are usually captured upstream (e.g., in the Product Master or Order Lines) and passed in the input file to ensure that Zuora Revenue can generate the correct Journal Entry activity for the subledger.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Data Ingestion"}
{"instruction": "Does setting a revenue line amount to $0 reverse previously recognized revenue?", "response": "Yes, if a line's amount is updated to $0 (e.g., via a cancellation or modification), the system will reverse the previously recognized contract revenue, even if the Performance Obligation (POB) template is set to 'Retain Amount'.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Revenue Reversal"}
{"instruction": "How should initial open balances be loaded via MJE during a migration?", "response": "Initial open balances can be loaded via a Manual Journal Entry (MJE). The MJE should book the balance (typically to Deferred Revenue and a contra-Revenue account). If the balance already exists in the GL, users can select the option to 'Skip GL Transfer' for that specific MJE batch to avoid double-posting.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "Data Migration"}
{"instruction": "Is it advisable to use negative Selling Price (SSP) values in Zuora Revenue?", "response": "No, using negative SSP values is not recommended as it can lead to irrational allocations where allocated values exceed the total contract value. $0 SSP is permitted, but negative values should be avoided.", "category": "Best Practice", "topic": "SSP Allocation"}
{"instruction": "How can revenue recognition for a discount line be deferred until the parent line is recognized?", "response": "To defer a discount line's revenue until the parent line is recognized, you is the maximum age of a Production backup available for a Sandbox refresh?", "response": "The oldest available daily backup for a Production to Sandbox refresh is 45 days.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Environment Management"}
{"instruction": "Can Ramp Orders in Zuora Billing automatically trigger Ramp Revenue recognition in Revenue?", "response": "Ramp Orders in Billing populate the Ramp ID and Deal Reference in the integration, but this does not automatically trigger ramp normalization in Revenue unless specifically configured. In Order to Revenue (OTR), the Ramp Deal Reference may not populate by default and might require Data Augmentation.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Ramp Revenue"}
{"instruction": "Does Attribute Based Pricing (ABP) work with the K2 integration?", "response": "No, Attribute Based Pricing (ABP) is not supported out-of-the-box with the K2 integration because the K2 CCV service reads list prices from the static Product Catalog rather than the ABP data model. ABP is supported in the Order to Revenue (OTR) integration.", "category": "Comparison", "topic": "Feature Support"}
{"instruction": "How does the 'Period Name' filter work in the Waterfall Report?", "response": "The 'Period Name' filter in the Waterfall Report selects data based on the Revenue Schedule. If revenue is scheduled to be recognized in the selected period, it will appear in the report, regardless of whether the Order Date or Start Date is in the past. 'Current Period' displays a snapshot of all future scheduled revenue as of that period close.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Reporting Logic"}
{"instruction": "Can a user undo an event file upload before processing?", "response": "It is not possible to 'undo' or delete the file itself after upload. However, users can navigate to the Inbound > Unprocessed Events screen and delete the specific event records before they are processed by the system.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "Data Management"}
{"instruction": "What is the best practice for the user account used to schedule background jobs?", "response": "It is best practice to use a dedicated generic account (e.g., an IT or Admin group email) to schedule background jobs. This prevents jobs from failing or needing rescheduling if a specific employee leaves the organization and their user account is deactivated.", "category": "Best Practice", "topic": "System Administration"}
{"instruction": "Is there an automated process to delete data from the Revenue Line Staging table?", "response": "No, there is no automated process to delete data from the Line Staging table. For small volumes, data can be deleted via the 'Manage Inbound' UI. For large volumes, an asynchronous process can be used if Unified Authentication (UA) is enabled, or a support ticket may be required.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "Data Maintenance"}
{"instruction": "How are POB template version changes applied to existing Revenue Contracts?", "response": "POB template versions are applied based on the Sales Order Date. Re-collecting an existing Sales Order line will not automatically apply a newer POB template version if the order date remains the same. The line generally retains the version active at the time of its initial collection.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "POB Configuration"}
{"instruction": "Can Revenue Journals and MJEs be transferred in a single Accounting Batch?", "response": "Yes, Zuora Revenue defaults to transferring GL Journals and MJEs in a single batch unless a filter is applied. For this to work effectively, the field mappings for both objects should be aligned.", "category": "Definitional", "topic": "GL Interface"}
{"instruction": "Is there a read-only mode for a Zuora Revenue tenant during maintenance or cutover?", "response": "There is no single global switch to put a tenant into read-only mode. The recommended workaround is to bulk update user roles to remove write privileges (make them Read Only) during the maintenance window and revert the changes afterwards.", "category": "Procedural", "topic": "System Administration"}
{"instruction": "What is the row limit for BI View exports and the recommended alternative for larger datasets?", "response": "Exports from BI Views are limited to approximately 20 million rows.
