  "use_case_description": "Snowflake signs a 3-year enterprise Order Form for the Snowflake AI Data Cloud modeled as a capacity commitment (prepaid consumption credits) with an annual ramp and an on-demand overage rate once the committed balance is exhausted. Create a Subscription with a Ramp (or three annual segments) for the Capacity Commitment rate plan: Year 1 committed spend $750,000 billed annually in advance; Year 2 $1,250,000 billed annually in advance; Year 3 $2,000,000 billed annually in advance (all demo pricing). Treat the committed spend as a prepaid drawdown balance that is relieved as usage occurs, using usage imports (e.g., credits consumed) to drive recognition rather than straight-line over the year. Add a separate Usage charge for Overage Consumption billed monthly in arrears at $5.75 per credit once the committed credit balance is depleted (and/or for usage explicitly classified as overage), with invoices generated monthly based on usage records. Optionally include metered storage as a separate usage component at $30 per TB-month billed monthly in arrears (kept separate from the committed credit pool for demo clarity). Include a Professional Services rate plan for implementation/migration/training sold alongside the commit as a fixed-fee SOW: $200,000 total, invoiced 50% at kickoff and 50% at go-live, with the commercial intent that services support adoption of the platform during Year 1. Apply a negotiated bundle discount of 10% off list across the committed spend and services to force allocation in revenue (allocate discount across POBs using list prices as SSP proxies). Revenue expectation (inferred): committed capacity is recognized as the customer consumes credits (release from deferred as-used); overage and storage are recognized as-used/as-billed in the monthly period; services are recognized as delivered (over time or at milestone depending on SOW acceptance criteria)."
