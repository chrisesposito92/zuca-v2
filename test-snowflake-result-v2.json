    "use_case_description": "Snowflake signs a 3-year enterprise Order Form for the Snowflake AI Data Cloud modeled as a capacity commitment (prepaid consumption credits) with an annual ramp and an on-demand overage rate once the committed balance is exhausted. Create a Subscription with a Ramp (or three annual segments) for the Capacity Commitment rate plan: Year 1 committed spend $750,000 billed annually in advance; Year 2 $1,250,000 billed annually in advance; Year 3 $2,000,000 billed annually in advance (all demo pricing). Treat the committed spend as a prepaid drawdown balance that is relieved as usage occurs, using usage imports (e.g., credits consumed) to drive recognition rather than straight-line over the year. Add a separate Usage charge for Overage Consumption billed monthly in arrears at $5.75 per credit once the committed credit balance is depleted (and/or for usage explicitly classified as overage), with invoices generated monthly based on usage records. Optionally include metered storage as a separate usage component at $30 per TB-month billed monthly in arrears (kept separate from the committed credit pool for demo clarity). Include a Professional Services rate plan for implementation/migration/training sold alongside the commit as a fixed-fee SOW: $200,000 total, invoiced 50% at kickoff and 50% at go-live, with the commercial intent that services support adoption of the platform during Year 1. Apply a negotiated bundle discount of 10% off list across the committed spend and services to force allocation in revenue (allocate discount across POBs using list prices as SSP proxies). Revenue expectation (inferred): committed capacity is recognized as the customer consumes credits (release from deferred as-used); overage and storage are recognized as-used/as-billed in the monthly period; services are recognized as delivered (over time or at milestone depending on SOW acceptance criteria)."

      "Capacity commitment is treated as prepaid/deferred and relieved based on actual consumption (usage) events rather than straight-line recognition; any unconsumed balance remains deferred unless an expiry/breakage policy is later defined.",
      "Overage consumption is a separate monthly usage charge billed in arrears at $5.75 per credit and recognized as usage is billed/consumed (depending on template choice); it is triggered only after the committed balance is depleted and/or when usage is explicitly classified as overage.",

      "Professional Services (PS) is a fixed-fee SOW of $200,000 sold with the commit, invoiced 50% at kickoff and 50% at go-live (milestone-based billing), with intent that services support adoption during Year 1.",

      "Revenue allocation is expected to occur in Zuora Revenue using list price as the SSP proxy for allocation-eligible performance obligations (capacity commitment POB(s) and PS POB(s)); transaction price is the discounted sell price and the discount is allocated on a relative-SSP basis.",
      "Revenue recognition templates are assumed as follows unless changed: commitment is event-driven (as-consumed) despite annual upfront billing; overage/storage are recognized in the billed period (monthly in arrears) unless you switch to event-timing recognition; PS milestones are recognized on milestone completion events (or acceptance if required).",

In the absence of imported consumption or billing events, revenue remains $0 in period waterfalls until those events are provided.",

      "[BLOCKING] What is the committed drawdown rate (implied $ per credit) used to convert consumed credits into revenue release amounts, and does it vary by contract year/ramp segment? (This drives the release calculation and year-by-year deferral buckets.)",
      "[BLOCKING] Do committed credits expire annually (use-it-or-lose-it), roll forward across years, or require a year-end true-up? If expiry exists, what is the breakage policy/timing? (This affects deferred balance behavior and potential breakage recognition.)",
      "[BLOCKING] How will usage records distinguish drawdown (consume prepaid) vs overage (billable PayGo)? If you want automatic overage once depleted, where/how is depletion tracked (e.g., Prepaid Balance, custom balance, external meter)? (This affects rating, billing eligibility, and correct rev release vs billing.)",
      "[HIGH] Should Professional Services be recognized strictly as two point-in-time milestones, or partially/fully over time during Year 1 based on SOW delivery terms (e.g., hours/effort or continuous transfer)? (This changes the PS POB template and revenue pattern.)",
      "[HIGH] For overage and storage recognition, do you want revenue recognized strictly upon billing (invoice-driven) or strictly upon consumption timing (event-driven), independent of invoice timing? (This determines whether to use a billing-triggered vs event-triggered template.)",
      "[MEDIUM] Should monthly in-arrears usage invoices be dated on the last day of the month (e.g., 2026-01-31) or on the next period start (e.g., 2026-02-01), based on your bill cycle day and bill run process? (This affects invoice dating and period cutoffs.)",
