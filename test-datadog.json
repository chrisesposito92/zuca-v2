  "use_case_description": "Customer signs a 12-month observability agreement anchored on Infrastructure Monitoring (Enterprise) with a committed baseline of 500 hosts at $23/host/month (list), billed monthly in advance but committed for the full annual term. The Infra rate plan also includes a separate usage/overage charge for any host-hours above the 500-host commitment, priced at the on-demand equivalent of $27/host/month (modeled as a usage charge rated monthly from host-hour consumption). Starting in month 7 (a mid-term upgrade / contract modification), the customer adds 200 more committed Infra hosts (bringing the baseline to 700) and also adds APM at 150 APM hosts at $31/APM host/month (list), billed monthly for the remainder of the term with proration from the effective date. APM also includes monthly usage overages billed in arrears: $1.70 per million indexed spans and $0.10 per GB ingested spans beyond included allotments (modeled as separate usage charges). In the same month-7 upgrade, the customer adds Log Management usage charges for ongoing consumption billed monthly in arrears: Log Ingest at $0.10/GB and Standard Indexing at $1.70 per million events (billed-annually rates used as list for the demo). Commercially, the seller applies a 12% bundle discount to the fixed recurring components (Infra committed hosts + APM host subscription) starting at the upgrade effective date; usage overages remain undiscounted and bill at list. Revenue expectation (inferred): fixed SaaS subscription components recognized ratably over the service period; usage/overage charges recognized as consumption occurs; the mid-term upgrade is treated as a contract modification that may require reallocation across remaining performance obligations depending on SSP and modification treatment."
