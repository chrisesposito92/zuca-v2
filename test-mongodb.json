  "use_case_description": "MongoDB Atlas signs a 24-month Enterprise Agreement combining committed cluster capacity with consumption-based storage and data transfer. The core commitment is for 3 M50 clusters (dedicated, high-availability) at $2,500/cluster/month list price, billed monthly in advance with an 18% enterprise discount applied. The agreement includes metered usage components billed monthly in arrears: storage at $0.25/GB-month and data transfer at $0.10/GB. In month 10, the customer adds a 4th M50 cluster (co-termed, prorated for remaining 15 months) and activates the Premium Backup add-on at $500/month per cluster (applied to all 4 clusters from month 10 forward). Professional Services are included: a $75,000 migration/onboarding engagement delivered over the first 6 months with milestone billing (25% at kickoff, 50% at data migration complete, 25% at go-live). The bundle discount of 18% applies to all fixed recurring components (clusters + backup) but not to usage or services. Revenue expectation: committed clusters recognized ratably; usage recognized as-consumed; backup add-on recognized ratably from activation; services recognized as milestones achieved."
