    "use_case_description": "Twilio sells a 12-month enterprise communications agreement modeled as pure consumption across three usage products: Twilio SMS (US), Programmable Voice (US), and SendGrid Email API (Premier). The customer can run on Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) tiered pricing, where SMS is billed per segment with monthly volume tiers (e.g., $0.0083/segment for 1-150k per month stepping down to $0.0073/segment for 1,000,001+), and Voice is billed per minute with monthly volume tiers. For Email API (Premier), model as metered email credits with demo tier pricing. The same customer also signs a committed-use contract that provides contracted discounted unit rates in exchange for an annual commitment (modeled as a prepaid committed-usage deposit/balance that draws down as usage occurs): SMS at $0.0069/segment, Voice outbound at $0.0098/min and inbound local at $0.0028/min, and Email at $0.0006/email. Billing is monthly in arrears for actual usage, applying committed discounted rates while commitment balance remains; if the commitment is exhausted mid-term, overage reverts to the standard PAYG tier schedule for that month. At contract end, any shortfall vs commitment is subject to a true-up invoice (or breakage rules), while any overage is already billed as consumed."

      "[HIGH] How should committed drawdown appear on invoices and in the billing-to-revenue feed: billed at discounted rates with prepaid balance application vs billed at $0 with only balance drawdown events? (Affects invoice presentation, taxation, and Zuora Revenue ingestion approach.)",
      "[HIGH] Confirm whether Zuora Revenue will recognize from usage/consumption events (preferred for consumption timing) or from invoices only (billing-driven fallback). (Determines required event feeds and template mappings.)",
      "[HIGH] Provide the full PAYG tier schedules and rules (tier boundaries, prices, and whether tiers reset monthly and are per-charge): (a) SMS per segment, (b) Voice per minute, (c) Email credits. (Required to rate overage accurately and/or represent pricing consistently.)",
      "[MEDIUM] Confirm the monthly arrears invoice dating convention: invoice dated month-end (e.g., 2026-01-31) vs issued the next day/month (e.g., 2026-02-01) while covering prior month usage. (Affects accounting period cutoffs and operational billing runs.)",
      "[MEDIUM] What is the exact date for the end-of-term settlement transaction (if any): 2026-12-31 (last service day) vs 2027-01-01 (subscription end boundary) vs later invoicing date? (Affects which accounting period captures true-up/breakage.)",
      "[MEDIUM] If a true-up invoice is issued: is it taxable, and does it need to be allocated/attributed by product (SMS/Voice/Email) or can it remain as a single settlement line? (Affects tax and revenue product attribution.)",
      "[NICE-TO-KNOW / DATA] For producing a 2026 revenue schedule: provide monthly usage volumes for committed drawdown (segments/minutes/emails) and monthly overage volumes plus effective tiered rates (or rated amounts) for PAYG overage. (Needed to populate monthly recognized revenue under consumption-based recognition.)",
      "[NICE-TO-KNOW / DATA] For EVT-PIT-AMOUNT deposit release: will you provide BY_AMOUNT event data (release amounts/dates) derived from rated usage, or should releases be inferred from committed usage charges/invoices? (Determines the operational event-feed design.)"
