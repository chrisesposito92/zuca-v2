  "use_case_description": "Salesforce sells an enterprise multi-cloud agreement that includes Sales Cloud (Enterprise) and Service Cloud (Enterprise) user licenses, plus a fixed-scope implementation services package and instructor-led training for admins/agents. The subscription portion is modeled as two separate product rate plans: (1) Sales Cloud (Enterprise) with a recurring per-user charge at $175/user/month billed annually, and (2) Service Cloud (Enterprise) with a recurring per-user charge at $175/user/month billed annually; the initial order is for 2,000 Sales Cloud users and 1,200 Service Cloud users. As part of the enterprise bundle, the customer negotiates a single commercial discount that reduces total contract consideration by ~15% versus combined list pricing across the subscription and services components, so we expect allocation across multiple performance obligations using SSP/list prices. Add Premier Success Plan as an attached subscription add-on rate plan priced at 30% of net license fees (calculated from the discounted Sales+Service license amount) and billed on the same annual schedule. Implementation Services are sold as a separate services product rate plan with a one-time fixed fee list price of $150,000 (discounted in the deal to $135,000) invoiced 50% at kickoff and 50% at go-live/acceptance. Trailhead Academy training is sold as a separate product rate plan with one-time per-attendee charges at $3,000 per attendee per course; the customer prepurchases 60 seats (list $180,000) discounted to $153,000 and training is delivered in the first 90 days. Mid-term expansion: on 07/01/2026 the customer adds 200 additional Service Cloud users co-termed to the 12-month agreement with proration for the remaining term and billed on the next invoice. Revenue expectation (inferred): subscriptions (including Success Plan) recognized ratably over the term; implementation recognized over time as services are performed (or by milestone if that best reflects progress); training recognized when delivered."
